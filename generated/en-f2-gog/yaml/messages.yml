ACBrahmn:
  100: You see a regular domesticated brahmin.
  101: |-
    The brahmin's extra head is probably the result of a regular
     cow being exposed too soon to radiation.
  102: You don’t notice anything unusual about the brahmin.
  103: Brahmin aren't much for conversations.
  104: |-
    Don't you have anything better to do than sit around
     talking to a two-headed cow?
  105: Brahmin are a mutated breed of cows.
ACMORLIS:
  100: You see Morlis, one of your aunts -- the one who never liked you.
  101: Why do you bother me, nephew? Can't you see I'm busy?
  301: Why do you bother me, niece? Can't you see I'm busy?
  102: Umm, okay. Sorry.
  103: What is it? You know I have a lot to do!
  104: Ummm, Mynoc said...
  105: Mynoc said what? Out with it, child!
  106: That, umm, you might have some flint.
  107: I do. You want some, is that it?
  108: Well, yeah.
  109: |-
    Well... I want three doses of healing powder. Bad times are coming
     and I'm going to be ready. Bring them to me and you can have the flint. Now
     get to it!
  110: Yes, ma'am!
  111: Now don't waste my time. Do you have the powders?
  112: Yes, here they are.
  113: Umm, I guess not.
  114: Here is the flint.  Now off with you! I don't have time to gossip.
  115: Thank you, Aunt Morlis.
  116: |-
    Again you waste my time, worthless nephew! How did you ever become
     the Chosen One?
  117: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  118: Uh, Aunt Morlis, I have three right here.
  150: |-
    Aunt Morlis, I'm on a perilous quest for the salvation of our village.
     My chances of success will be greatly enhanced if I keep the healing powders
     for myself and you give me the flint. Don't you agree?
  151: What do you think you are doing, child? This is no way for the Chosen One to
    act. Now get out of my sight!
  152: |-
    If this flint is so important that you are willing to disgrace the name of the Chosen One, then here. Take
     the flint and get out of my sight.
  153: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  154: 'Well... Oh, very well. Here is the flint. I wish you a safe journey, child. '
  155: No, I don't. Now stop wasting my time and get out of here!
  156: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  200: So you've returned. Did you find the holy Thirteen?
  201: No, Aunt Morlis, I...
  202: Then get yourself out of here and find it! People are depending on you!
  203: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  204: Well, here you are again. Have you once again failed to complete your quest?
  205: Yes, Aunt Morlis, but...
  206: Then get yourself out of here and don't come back until you do! Why waste time
    coming back here, when you could be using that time to continue your search!?
  207: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  208: The fact that you are standing here must mean that you have completed your
    quest. You wouldn't waste precious time returning here empty-handed, would you?
  209: Yes, Aunt Morlis. I mean no, Aunt Morlis. Uh, I've got to go, Aunt Morlis.
  210: So, child. Once again you stand before me. Are you empty-handed yet again?
  211: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  212: 'Listen, '
  213: ". People are dying, cattle are dying, and crops are failing. Everyone is either
    hungry, sick, or both. Our time draws near. If you do not find the GECK soon,
    we are doomed. Do you understand me?"
  214: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
  215: Then get yourself out of here and find the GECK! People are depending on you!
  216: Yes, Aunt Morlis.
ACMynoc:
  100: You see the bridge guard.
  101: You see Mynoc, the bridge guard.
  150: |-
    Before you stands a large warrior of your village,
     holding a spear.
  151: "[TALK]"
  152: Hello, Chosen One. Off to find the GECK?
  153: Yes.
  154: |-
    Yes. But before I go, I would like to ask you some
     questions.
  155: |-
    Not just yet. I’m going to look around a little
     bit more.
  156: Well, may the gods watch over you.
  157: Thank you, goodbye.
  158: What do you want to know?
  159: |-
    What can you tell me of the men who trade with our
     village?
  160: |-
    What can you tell me about this object I have from
     a vault?
  161: Nothing, never mind.
  162: |-
    Very well, but don't waste too much time. Without the GECK,
     we're doomed.
  163: I know, don’t worry -- I’ve got it all under control.
  164: Why?
  165: I must be going. Goodbye.
  166: |-
    The traders? They come from Klamath about every two months. There
     won't be another here for a month or more, but Klamath's only a few days
     east of here.
  167: Thank you. Goodbye.
  168: |-
    What can you tell me about this object I have from
     the sacred vault?
  169: |-
    Looks like a metal water gourd. Maybe the
     vault sent it to us as an omen.
  170: Can you tell me who brought this item to our village?
  171: Thank you. I must going. Goodbye.
  172: I hope you do.
  173: Your overconfidence makes all of us suffer! Goodbye!
  174: Goodbye.
  175: |-
    Why? Look around you -- our village dies. The gardens wither and
     every day children and old ones collapse. You must bring Eden to us before
     it is too late!
  176: And I will take care of it.  Goodbye.
  177: |-
    I am the Chosen One -- I "must" do only as I
     please. Goodbye.
  178: |-
    I don't remember his name, just that he was old and loud -- too
     loud for proper manners -- but he knew many things. He was from Klamath, east
     like I said.
  179: Thank you, goodbye.
  180: |-
    Are you still here? You must go find the GECK. Staying here
     doesn't help us.
  181: |-
    This bridge is all you need to worry about,
     friend. I can take care of myself.
  182: I was just heading out. Goodbye, my friend.
  183: I will speak to you no longer, insubordinate pig!
  184: I would like to ask you another question.
  185: That was quick! Have you found the holy Vault 13?
  186: Yes.
  187: No, not yet.
  188: |-
    You have? Wonderful! Did you bring back the
     GECK?
  189: No.
  190: No. I haven’t spoken to the people of the vault yet.
  191: I don’t believe that’s any business of yours, my friend.
  192: |-
    No? Chosen One, three old ones have died since you left. You must
     not waste any more time.
  193: I’ll find it, don’t worry.
  194: I’m getting sick of your constant nagging.
  195: Well, why are you talking to me? Talk to them, and get the GECK.
  196: I will -- all in good time, my friend.
  197: I’m getting sick of your constant nagging.
  198: What news of the GECK, Chosen One?
  199: I have found the vault!
  200: I have not been able to find Vault 13.
  201: Well, look, it's the Chosen One.
  202: Hello.
  203: Shut up.
  204: Can I ask you a question?
  205: No, I've no time for you.
  206: Whatever. Good bye.
  207: Oh well. See you around.
  208: Go die.
  209: |-
    Greetings, dull one! See bridge? You cross, you be careful.
     Bridge dangerous. You not want to fall. Okay?
  210: Umm... Hunh?
  211: Wretch! You have failed the village!
  212: You betray us. For that you'll die!
  213: You are a traitor to your own people.
  214: Why do you do this?
  215: The Elder was wrong. You are evil.
  300: |-
    My father taught me how to make stronger blades than most. Get me a piece
     of flint and I'll fix your spear, too. You'll need it in the wilderness.
  301: Where would I get some of this flint?
  302: |-
    They say your aunt Morlis has been hoarding a piece. She's so
     ill-tempered I don't think anyone's asked her. Of course, the witch will want
     something in return.
  303: Thanks. Goodbye.
  304: Did you talk your aunt out of her flint?
  305: Yes, I have some right here.
  306: Not yet.
  307: It's a good piece. Give me your spear.
  308: Here you go.
  309: I guess I don't have one.
  310: Now, you put the pieces like so...
  311: |-
    The Chosen One without a spear? Well, you'll have to take one of
     mine. Now, let's get to work...
  312: Here is your new spear.
  313: Thank you, my friend -- this will help a lot.
  314: |-
    Yes, but I was wondering about your spear. It looks a little
     different.
  400: Welcome home, Chosen One! Did you find the vault? Have you returned with the
    GECK?
  401: Me not find yet.
  402: No, I haven't found it yet.
  403: I'm not in the mood for your questions. Goodbye.
  404: |-
    Things are not going well, Chosen One. The drought is getting worse and our crops are
     sure to fail. We are trying to salvage what we can to build up our food reserves.
  405: Why no trade with other village?
  406: Me doing best me can. Me find GECK. Me return.
  407: 'Why can''t we trade with other villages for the food we need? '
  408: I'm doing my best. When I find the GECK I'll return with it.
  409: |-
    We are a simple people and have little to offer in trade. The few towns that we have
     contacted while you were away have shown no interest in helping us.
  410: Me see.
  411: I see.
  412: You are our hope, Chosen One. Please do not fail us!
  413: It is good to see you, Chosen One. How fares your quest?
  414: Me still look.
  415: I'm still looking.
  416: I don't want to talk about it.
  417: |-
    You must hurry. Things are getting worse here at home. Soon there will be little food and
     the Elder speaks of rationing what we have. I fear for the future of Arroyo.
  418: "Chosen One! Please tell me that you have completed your quest. Our village
    is dying, and so\n are our people. "
  419: No, me still look.
  420: No, I'm still looking.
  421: How are things?
  422: |-
    I am sorry, Chosen One, but I am beginning to question my faith in you. The very lives of
     our people are in your hands. Please find the holy Thirteen and return to us with the GECK!
  423: |-
    Our crops fail, the brahmin die, everyone goes hungry now. The cries of the children at night
     allow no one any sleep. We are becoming a desperate people.
  424: Me continue look.
  425: I'll do what I can.
  426: Once again you return to us, Chosen One. Not empty-handed, I hope?
  427: Me sorry, no find GECK yet.
  428: I'm sorry, I still haven't found the GECK.
  429: I've had enough of this.
  430: |-
    People are dying here while you stroll about the lands. Perhaps you should be searching
     elsewhere instead of returning here.

  100: You see a plant of dark soul.
  101: |-
    These plants aren’t just harmful to the garden.  They also have the ability to attack humans
     and other creatures.
  102: |-
    These plants of dark soul are an odd mutation. It is doubtful that they mutated this way as
     a result of natural causes.
  103: You notice nothing extra about these plants - other than the fact that they
    attack humans.
  150: You have rid the garden of all the plants of dark soul.

  153: Can you tell me where I can find more healing powder?
  154: What can you tell me of the traders who trade with us?
  155: It is good to see you, but I must be going.
  156: Gods protect you on your journey.
  157: I do have a question for you.
  158: Goodbye, my friend.
  159: Go see Hakunin in the north corner of the village.  He can help you.
  160: Thank you.  Goodbye.
  161: |-
    Oh, it's not my place to deal with the traders. Talk to Mynoc, the guardian of the
     great bridge. He sees them all.
  162: Thank you.  Goodbye.
  163: Could you tell me where the great bridge is located?
  164: One more question, if I may.
  165: Good joke, Chosen One! You know where it is. That way -- to the south.
  166: Thank you.  Goodbye.
  167: One more question, if I may.
  168: Of course, what is it?
  169: Could you tell me where I can find some healing herbs?

  180: You are a traitor to your own people.
  181: Why do you do this?
  182: You are evil. The Chosen One is evil!
  183: They come to our village from the east, but their goods are poor.
  184: Could you tell me where I can find some healing herbs?
  185: Thank you. Goodbye.
  186: One more question, if I may.
  300: Hello, Chosen One. Nice to see you again. I pray that your holy quest is going
    well. Is there something I can help you with?
  301: Chosen One, our people are dying. You must hurry your search for the holy GECK.
    What may I do to aid you in this most holy of quests?
  302: |-
    We are running out of time, Chosen One. Please, finish your holy quest soon. We can
     not afford to wait much longer. If there's anythying I can do to help you to save us, let me know.

  178: Why do you do this?
  179: Death to the evil one!

  102: You see Hakunin. He's very near death.
  103: Hakunin is badly burned. He smells like roast chicken, looks like burnt meatloaf,
    and you don't know how he's managed to stay alive this long.
  104: Greetings, Chosen. Why does the earth before me warm to the touch of your passing?
  105: 'Uh? '
  106: 'I''ve come to say goodbye. I''m leaving on my holy quest. '
  107: 'I''m heading out. I was hoping just this once you''d talk like a real person. '
  108: 'You are doing just way too many chems. I''m outta here. '
  109: I'm hurt. Can you heal me?
  110: There were some pretty nasty plants infesting your garden- I've taken care
    of them for you.
  111: Please reveal to clouded eyes the purpose of your passage.
  112: 'Uh? '

  117: The Earth sings with the news of a champion upon the land.... Perhaps, before
    you go, you would bestow a kindness?
  118: Sure. What do you need?
  119: It depends… what'll you give me?
  120: The views of the world are many - a lesson you will learn soon.... Perhaps,
    before you reap the experiences of life, you would bestow a kindness?
  121: Did you just ask me to do you a favor? If so, sure, why not?
  122: I'll do something for you, but since I have to work this hard just to understand
    you, this task will cost.
  123: A blessing on you, for you are truly a child of nature. Would you please use
    your special talents and rid my garden of the plants of dark soul?
  124: 'Uh-huh. '
  125: Nuh-uh. Youuu. Giv. Hed hurt.
  126: May your aura grace my presence when you are... Oh, come to my door when you're
    done and I'll give you something good.
  127: Urgh.
  128: The plants of dark soul have infested my garden again. Many seasons have touched
    my bones and I am too frail for that fight which is eternal in nature. I ask that
    you be my champion.
  129: I don't think so. I need to start my quest right away.
  130: I know you're not a bad guy, but I've got a headache already, so I think I'll
    have to pass.
  131: Forget it. I'm the future leader of this tribe and it would be undignified
    for me to do your gardening for you.
  132: I'd be honored, holy one.
  133: Did you just ask me to weed your garden? If that's the case, okay.
  134: For a price.
  135: To ask payment for a gift will bring you less than the gift itself.  I will
    give you such and add the lesson of your self-disappointment at the receiving.
  136: Good enough. Where's the garden?
  137: You know, a nice gift would be to SPEAK ENGLISH!
  138: What if I give you a lesson in disappointment and leave right now? Bye.
  139: Well, if that's your attitude, I don't think I'm interested. Goodbye.
  140: If we speak the same words, do we mean the same thing? Do words always carry
    the same touch of a soul?
  141: Oh, yeah. Much better. And the lesson I learned is to shut up and just ask
    where the garden is.
  142: 'Let''s try the word, "goodbye." It means I''m leaving. '
  143: Surely you remember it is to the northeast, foolish one.
  144: Thank you for your help.
  145: Thanks. I actually understood that.
  146: 'Are you calling me a fool? I don''t think I want to help you, after all. '
  147: I'll be back for my payment soon.
  148: The burden you carry now will grow ever heavier.
  149: May the gods bless your efforts, Chosen. May your aura grace my presence when
    the earth breathes clean again.
  150: I take it you want to see me again when I'm done... You could have just said
    so, you know.
  151: Goodbye.
  152: 'Ha! The founder''s spirit lives in you. Focus in to fortify the self to expand
    the greatness to enable such to touch the world. Of course, the rewards will be
    more than those of the spirit. '
  153: Sounds good. I'll be back when I'm done.
  154: So, I'm getting an actual thing in payment. Good enough. See ya later.
  155: I think you've been playing with those plants way too much. To avoid your fate,
    I'm staying away from the garden.
  156: Time can neither be wasted or saved- it must always be now. The actions create
    the fabric of your life.
  157: 'Uh, right. Like I said, I''ve got to go. Goodbye. '
  158: 'You know, talking to you makes me wonder about that time can''t be wasted
    idea. I''m outta here. '
  159: If only I had your wisdom, wise one. Forgive me- of course I'll take care of
    it for you.
  160: You may bear the mantle of the Chosen, but your dark soul cries from within.
  161: 'I beg your forgiveness, holy one. How can I cleanse my soul? '
  162: That's right, Hakunin, and you'd be a real wise man not to forget it.
  163: My head aches from within listening to you. I'm gone.
  164: Booka!
  165: Cleanse your soul as you would banish demons from my garden.
  166: It shall be done, wise one. I will come seek your forgiveness after I have
    purified your garden.
  167: You're trying to say that weeding your garden will be good for me, right? Well,
    okay, I'll give it a try.
  168: I kinda like my soul the way it is. Bye.
  169: I'm not worthy. I'll take my leave now.
  170: Chosen, once again the wholeness of your being is like a land blessed.
  171: Thank you.
  172: You mean I'm better, right?
  173: To make one whole instills a sense of fullness that you would be well to understand,
    Chosen.
  174: Wait, don't tell me. I'm better and you felt good doing it, right? Thanks.
  175: You are wise and kind, Holy One.
  176: In what way may I touch the chosen soul, Seed of the Dweller?
  177: Uh, where exactly is your garden?
  178: I'm hurt. Can you heal me?
  179: Oh, nothing. Goodbye.
  180: Ahh. You return the spirit of the Dweller to the world and bring a smile to
    the soul of an old man in passing. For this, I give you powders of healing. Remember,
    they fog the mind as they cleanse the body.
  181: Thank you.
  182: 'And also, will I mix the broc flower with the xander root together whenever
    you bring both to me. May your pathways be true and your heart follow suit. '
  183: Where can I find these things?
  184: Thank you.
  185: I'm almost sorry to go. I can just about understand you now. Bye.
  186: Ah, Chosen, my garden is well- how is yours?
  187: I'm all right.
  188: I need healing.
  189: Where did you say the plants were?
  190: I don't have a garden- what the hell are you talking about this time?
  191: I'd like you to make some healing powder for me.
  192: Oh, never mind. I've got to go.
  193: Ow?
  194: Ooog! Bak!
  195: The pleasure of these words fills me. Alas, the gods whisper for my ear. Goodbye.
  196: Bye.
  197: Still mixing the herbs, huh? See you later.
  198: We all have gardens. May your journeys act as tending. Be well. I must seek
    audience with the gods now.
  199: See ya.
  200: I'm betting you carry your audience with you wherever you go. Be well.
  201: Look to the north, Chosen, and the way will be open.
  202: Okay. Thanks.
  203: I am honored to serve the Chosen.
  204: Such is life. Two creates a third. You will need both xander root and broc
    flower for the healing powder.
  205: Oh. Thanks
  206: Poo.
  207: May this be of no use.
  208: Okay. Thanks.
  209: Uh!
  210: You are well.
  211: Thank you.
  212: No lessons? No incomprehensible speeches? You sure you're okay?
  213: Welcome, Chosen. Bless us with words that the GECK will be found soon. Our
    village ails, our need is great, our time, short.
  214: Nuh.
  215: And your ability to speak normally, non-existent. I'm still trying.
  216: 'I''m on it. '
  217: Get off my back, old man. I'm doing the best I can.
  218: I'm still looking, holy one. I hope to have the GECK soon.
  219: May the Earth cushion the steps you must take.
  220: May the Waters soothe your journey.
  221: May the Wind guide you to your goal.
  222: May the Fire toast your bottom until you get this done.
  223: Thanks.
  224: Say what?!
  225: Uh.
  226: Huh?!
  227: Welcome back, Chosen. I see by your face the salvation of the GECK is not yet
    ours. Be tireless as the ant before our reserves run out. You are our last hope.
  228: Uh-huh.
  229: I'm trying. I'd like to see the ant covering the miles I am.
  230: I'm doing my best.
  231: I'll double my efforts, holy one. I will not let you down.
  232: Yeah, yeah. I've heard it all before.
  233: Chosen - the village cries in desperation. The children are weak with hunger.
    Please, we can not hold out much longer.
  234: Uh-huh.
  235: I'm trying. I'm trying! Give me a break!
  236: I'll find the GECK, holy one. You have my word.
  237: I'll do my best to find the GECK.
  238: Chosen, the sands of time are but a few grains. Please. Bring the GECK soon
    and make the future of the village like the beach of the ocean. Quickly, before
    the last grain falls.
  239: Uh-huh.
  240: All right. I'm off to find it.
  241: Life's a beach, huh?
  242: I will find the GECK, holy one. I will not let our people down.
  243: Chosen, the spirits of our ancestors guide me to a world of dreams that I may
    touch thoughts. Our village suffers without the holy GECK. Your hands hold our
    lives as a father holds his children.
  244: Once again my spirit touches you from the void, Chosen. Our crops fail, our
    reserves are meager. Return to us with the GECK. Your failure is our last light.
  245: Chosen. The village weakens. It is harder to touch your dreams. You must hurry
    or we will all...
  246: Chosen? Chosen? Do you hear me? The village dies. All of our futures die, too.
    We have little left in both time and essence... Hurry.  Hurry...
  247: Chosen - the shadow of darkness arrived before you.
  248: Owwww!
  249: What happened?
  250: You look bad. Let me help.
  251: Child of Nature, how could we put such a burden on your shoulders? (sigh) Your
    people have been taken.
  252: Uhh?
  253: 'Yes. Gone. Many dark souls came, riding the metal birds like a flock of hungry
    chittick bugs, hiding their evil in shiny skins. '
  254: Ooo! Shiny Purty!
  255: No! Not shiny pretty! They kidnapped our people and took them to the southwest.
  256: Ow.
  257: Yes. Great sadness and pain. I stand between worlds to tell you, Chosen. Save
    your people.
  258: Uh?
  259: Chosen, please let my words touch you. Go southwest. South and west.  Save
    our people. Save our people.
  260: Uh-huh..
  261: Thank the ancestors. Now my soul my join the eternal song. Safe journey, Chosen.
  262: Go?
  263: Go!...
  264: Bye bye.
  265: Dark souls came. They took everyone.
  266: Dark souls? What do you mean?
  267: A rush of wind came. On it were great dragonflies that spat flame. Evil men
    crawled from the beasts' bellies and brought death to our warriors.
  268: Our warriors couldn't stop them?
  269: The spirit was willing, but the spearheads were weak. The evil ones burned
    our warriors with the lights of hell.
  270: They killed everyone?
  271: All were dead or taken. My spirit returned to flesh only to reveal the truth
    to the Chosen.
  272: What happened to the ones taken?
  273: The beasts swallowed all, then took to the winds.
  274: Uh, which way were the winds that they followed going?
  275: Did you never listen when I taught you the yearly dance of the wind spirits?
    South, of course.
  276: Your descriptions were so vivid and powerful, great Hakunin, that I was often
    stricken senseless for the duration of your lessons.
  277: 'Oh, those winds. Of course. '
  278: Yes, they traveled the wind south. I overheard the dark souls speaking. They
    planned to rest their beasts at a place named Navarro before crossing the great
    basin of our earth-mother's tears.
  279: What shall I do?
  280: Basin of tears?
  281: For me, nothing. Chosen, you must seek the fold of the dark ones and rescue
    our people.
  282: I will try.
  283: You are the Chosen. You must do.
  284: Hakunin?
  285: First time I understood what you meant.
  286: An ocean of tears, cried by a mother for her children.
  287: Oh, the ocean. But what shall I do?
  288: A strange mist stole their minds and sent them to the land of Sleep. The evil
    ones walked among the dreamers, yet did not dream.
  289: And then?
  290: Too many seasons and too many wounds, Chosen. Instead, you must listen.
  291: All right.
CCCHEAT:
  100: You see Mr. Cheater.
  101: He still looks like a cheater.
  200: Hello I am Mr. Cheater. How may I help you?
  201: Will you kidnap my tribe?
  202: Will you put me on the Shi quest?
  203: Will you put me on the Elron quest?
  204: Will you put me on the Brotherhood quest?
  205: Make it so I've already been to the military base.
  206: I've kidnapped your tribe.
  207: I've put you on the Shi quest.
  208: I've put you on the Elron quest.
  209: I've put you on the Brotherhood quest.
  210: Now you have been to the military base.
  211: Thank you, Mr. Cheater.
CCCHRIS:
  100: You see an old man.
  101: You see Chris, the gas station attendant.
  102: You see a scruffy-looking old man wearing a purple robe.
  103: |-
    Howdy, stranger. Whoa baby! Check out that set of wheels. Ain't seen one
     of those in years. What can old Chris do for you?
  104: |-
    Howdy, stranger. Ain't seen you around these parts before. What can old
     Chris do for you?
  105: What this place?
  106: Me look for Navarro. This it?
  107: You see metal bird fly here?
  108: You hear Enclave? They here?
  109: Me just look around.
  110: What is this place?
  111: I'm looking for Navarro. Is this it?
  112: Have you seen any vertibirds fly through here?
  113: Ever hear of the Enclave? Are they around here?
  114: I'm just looking around.
  115: |-
    This here's my place, Chris's. It's a service station - ain't you ever
     seen one of those, in old magazines and such? That's what I got here - a service
     station.
  116: Me look for Navarro. This it?
  117: You see metal bird fly here?
  118: You hear Enclave? They here?
  119: Uh... me got go.
  120: I'm looking for Navarro. Is this it?
  121: Have you seen any vertibirds fly through here?
  122: Ever hear of the Enclave? Are they around here?
  123: Sorry, got to go.
  124: |-
    Navarro? Ain't heard that name in ages. Old military base southeast of
     San Fran, and that's a ways south of here.
  125: Me been there. It not Navarro.
  126: Okay. Me thank. Me look there.
  127: You lie me. Me know Navarro here. You tell truth or me make you sorry!
  128: I've been there and that's not Navarro.
  129: Okay. I'll take a look there. Thanks.
  130: |-
    You're lying. I know that Navarro's here. Tell me the truth or you'll
     be sorry!
  131: |-
    Huh? Uh... Well sure it is. I heard tell of it a while back! Navarro
     military base, southeast of San Francisco.
  132: You lie me. Me no got patience. You tell truth or me make you sorry!
  133: |-
    You lie. I don't have the patience for this. Tell me the truth or
     you'll be sorry.
  134: |-
    Fuck you! (takes a radio out of robe) You want to see sorry? I got
     some boys who'll show you a whole new meaning for the word! (starts to turn the radio on)
  135: Me kill you dead!
  136: What you do now?
  137: Me gone.
  138: That's a bad move, partner.
  139: What do you think you're doing?
  140: Hey, I'm outta here.
  141: "(speaking into radio) Alert! We got an intruder at the station! Alert!"
  142: Done.
  143: |-
    Well, nice talking with you. Here's some advice though - ain't nothing
     in these parts except wasteland and radiation. Civilization's south of here. I'd be heading that way if I was you.
  144: Thanks.
  145: |-
    Metal birds? Oh, you must mean vertibirds. Now why would you be
     asking about them here?
  146: |-
    Vertibirds? That's an interesting subject. Now why would you be
     asking about them here?
  147: Shaman say metal bird take village, fly Navarro. Me try find.
  148: People interested. Me try find for them.
  149: You know about? What you know?
  150: |-
    The shaman of my tribe told me these vertibirds stole our people.
     I'm here to find them.
  151: |-
    I know some people who are interested in vertibirds. I'm trying
     to locate them for them.
  152: So you know about vertibirds. Tell me what you know.
  153: |-
    Shaman? Look here; if your shaman says he sees things flying around
     and scooping up people then he's been sniffing too many herbs. Got it?
  154: Hakunin great shaman. If he say he see then he see.
  155: |-
    Hakunin was a great shaman. If he says he saw vertibirds, then he
     saw them!
  156: |-
    Well, that doesn't mean anything to me, but in case I see one of
     these vertibirds, whom should I be telling?
  157: You tell me. Me be around.
  158: Tell Shi.
  159: Tell Brotherhood of Steel.
  160: Tell Hubologists.
  161: |-
    Take pick. You tell Shi or Brotherhood of Steel or Hubologists.
     Everybody interested.
  162: You tell me. I'll be around.
  163: You can tell the Shi.
  164: You can tell the Brotherhood of Steel.
  165: You can tell the Hubologists.
  166: |-
    Take your pick. You can tell the Shi or the Brotherhood of Steel
     or the Hubologists. Everybody seems to be interested in vertibirds.
  167: |-
    The Shi, huh? Well if you say so. I'll send word to 'em down in
     Chiny town. Meanwhile, I got things to do.
  168: |-
    Wait. Me have strong friends. They say Navarro here. You tell
     where or things get messy!
  169: |-
    Wait a minute, pal. Obviously, I've got some powerful friends and
     they tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy!
  170: |-
    The Brotherhood... Uh, yeah, well, I'll do just that. Meanwhile,
     I got things to do.
  171: |-

    Wait. Me have strong friends. They say Navarro here. You tell where
     or things get messy!
  178: |-
    Wait a minute, pal. Obviously, I've got some powerful friends and they
     tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy!
  179: |-
    Uh... Hey, I'm just told to shy off visitors and such. I don't want
     the kind of trouble you're talking.
  180: Then tell best way in base... now!
  181: Then I would suggest you tell me the best way into the base... now!
  182: |-
    I suppose that would be through the trap door in the floor of my room.
     Just go and leave me be.
  183: Okay, me go.
  184: All right. I'll do that.
  185: |-
    I know they fly over here from time to time. They're usually heading
     south toward San Fran. If you're interested in vertibirds, I'd head there.
  186: Okay, me try there.
  187: |-
    Me have friends who want me find vertibirds. Friends say vertibirds
     come here.
  188: Okay, I'll head that way.
  189: |-
    Look, I have some friends who want me to find vertibirds. They say
     they come from here.
  190: |-
    Enclave? That a group or something? That don't ring no chimes
     with me. What you want with 'em?
  191: Me want join.
  192: I want to join.
  193: Join up? You're a tribal! What makes you think they'd want a tribal?
  194: |-
    Join up? You're a tribal! What makes you think they'd want a tribal,
     and his posse no less?
  195: Me serious. Me join Enclave.
  196: Me serious. Me Join Enclave.
  197: I'm serious. I'm looking to join the Enclave.
  198: I'm serious. I'm looking to join the Enclave
  199: |-
    Wait a minute,dummy. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
     replacements?
  200: |-
    Wait a minute. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
     replacements?
  201: Uh... yeah.
  202: That's right.
  203: |-
    Damn. Sorry for the hassles. I'm supposed to clear a bunch of newbies
     coming through here but I got to weed out the trash. Anyway, just go up to the gate,
     through the woods there, and give 'em the password. It's 'sheepshead.' Oh, and stay on the path!
  204: Thanks!
  205: |-
    Wait a minute, dummy. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
     replacements? If that's the case, then why aren't you alone?
  206: |-
    Wait a minute. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
     replacements? If that's the case, then why aren't you alone?
  207: Uh... escort?
  208: I hired an escort!
  209: |-
    Well, I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but this here's private property.
     If you're going to be poking around somewhere, don't be doing it here.
  210: Done.
  211: You're back. What can old Chris help you with?
  212: You tell me Navarro south. You lie! Me here for truth.
  213: You told me Navarro was to the south, old man. Now I want to know the truth.
  214: You look familiar. Old Chris thinks he's seen you before... Nope, can't be.
  215: Intruder at the station! Send help!
  216: Sound the alarm!
  217: Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
  218: Die, scum!
  219: The Enclave will promote me for killing you!
  220: Die, outsider!
  221: What the...?!
  222: You use radio and me make you sorry!
  223: You use that radio and I'll make you sorry!
  224: |-
    Fuck you! You want to see sorry? I got some boys who'll show you a
     whole new meaning for the word! (starts to turn the radio on)

  227: Me gone.
  228: That's a bad move, partner.
  229: What do you think you're doing?
  230: Hey, I'm outta here.
  231: Yeah, right.
  232: He's pulling out a radio. He's going to alert the whole base! I've got to deal
    with him quickly.
  800: You conned Chris to give you the password.
  810: You killed Chris before he could warn the base.
CCGGUARD:
  100: 'You see a guard. '
  101: You see the gate guard.
  102: You see a guard wearing power armor of an unusual design. There is an insignia
    on the breastplate that you are unfamiliar with.
  103: Halt! This is federal property – no admittance without proper authorization.
  104: Uh... fed ur al?
  105: Me got pass... where I put?
  106: Me new. Me told you expect.
  107: Oh. Sorry, me go.
  108: I have my pass... it was right here.
  109: I’m a new recruit. I was told you’d be expecting me.
  110: Oh, sorry. I’ll be heading out then.
  111: You’re a little slow, aren'tcha?? Well, just keep moving and don’t come back
    here. You’ll be fine. Understand?
  112: Me want go inside.
  113: Ok. Me go.

    me your pass or give me the password!"

    Hello there, I haven’t seen you in Klamath before. I’m Aldo, the town greeter. (hic)
     It’s my job to greet anyone new in town and to answer any questions they might have about
     our bucolic little burg. Welcome to Klamath. (hic) Who might you be?
  201: Uhh, thanks for the greeting. I’m just a traveler.
  202: 'My name’s '
  203: " . Thanks for welcoming me here."
  204: " of Arroyo. I’m the Chosen One."
  205: You don’t need to know my name or anything else about me. Go away, you filthy
    drunkard.
  206: I don’t think a town like Klamath would have a drunk like you as a greeter,
    or anything else.
  300: 'The Chosen One. Oh mighty '
  301: |-
    , you must be very important and powerful among your people. Surely one of your great (hic)
     stature would be happy to follow our custom of tipping the town greeter. (urp)
  302: Here’s a tip for you - stay away from the booze for a while.
  303: A tip, huh? Well I guess it’s worth $5 to get you off my back.
  304: 'Well, I wouldn’t want to go against custom. Is $5 enough? '
  305: You should give me a tip, just so I won’t take the time to rid Klamath of your
    filthy hide.
  306: Sorry, the Chosen One has little use for money -— I have none to give you.
  350: 'Well, friend '
  351: |-
    , since you’re new to these (hic) parts, and look as though you could use (urp) some pointers,
     I’ll let you know that it’s customary to tip the town greeter before asking any questions and such.
  355: Sorry, I can’t spare any money for you.
  400: |-
    Well stranger, since you’re (hic) new to these parts, you probably don’t (urp) know that it’s
     (hic) customary to tip the town greeter before asking any questions and such.
  450: |-
    Thanks for the money, friend. (urp) I’m going to use it to get some (hic) medicine for my dry
     throat. Consider yourself officially (hic) greeted to the town of Klamath. Do you have any questions
     about our fair (urp) metropolis?
  451: No thanks, I think I can figure things out here on my own.
  452: Well, actually, I was curious about a thing or two.
  453: Aldo, I’m looking for a trader that sells beforetime things. You know, really
    old stuff.
  500: Ask away, oh benefactor of mine.
  501: What do folks do here in Klamath?
  502: Where can I trade things or find healing?
  503: Tell me about geckos.
  504: Where do you buy your booze?
  505: Thanks, I think that’s all I need to know for now.
  506: Do you know where I might find a GECK?
  550: |-
    Thanks for nothing. I hope you don’t stay in town too long. We don’t need your kind here.
     Humph. Tribals -- they’re all the same.
  600: |-
    Here in Klamath some people farm, some raise brahmin, but trapping geckos is what most of the
     people do.
  601: What’s a gecko?
  602: Oh, thanks. I guess that’s all I need to know.
  603: That’s interesting. I have another question, though.
  650: |-
    A gecko is a large lizard that’s hunted by the trappers round these parts for its meat and
     hide. But, it sure is a lot of work to catch them dang critters - and dangerous too. My advice to a
     friend...avoid it. It's far too much work.
  651: Oh, thanks. I guess that’s all I need to know.
  652: Hmm. One more thing, Aldo.
  700: |-
    You can buy or trade things at Buckner House and also the Golden Gecko. Sometimes they even
     have healing herbs available -- not that they’d give me any for my (hic) condition. They’re both run
     by real skinflints. Just get a little behind on your (hic) tab and out you go, into the cold and rain.
  701: Thanks for the information, that’s all I need for now.
  702: I’ve always found the fresh air invigorating. Hmm, I have another question
    for you.
  750: |-
    I know that you couldn’t spare any money for the official town greeter earlier, but perhaps
     (hic) this time you are feeling more generous and are ready to be greeted ‘officially’ to Klamath.
  751: I guess I could spare $5 to keep you off my back.
  752: I felt that something was missing. Here’s $5; I’m ready to be Greeted.
  753: No, thanks, I don’t think I need your official greeting.
  754: I think I’d rather have your insides greet my blade.
  800: |-
    Hey there, friend, good to see you again. Can you spare some money for a bit of medicine? My
     throat is getting dryer and scratchier (hic) all the time. I could even throw in another official
     (urp) greeting.
  801: Sure, I can always spare $5 for a friend’s medicine.
  802: Sorry, Aldo I can’t spare any right now.
  803: |-
    I think you’ve had enough medicine. You should sweat that poison out of your system with some
     hard work.
  810: |-
    Thanks for nothing. How can you be so cruel to someone as unwell as myself? Damn tribals!
     (Aldo spits on the ground at your feet, dribbling a bit on his scruffy chin)
  820: |-
    I’m certain that your generosity to someone as needful as myself (hic) will bring you good
     luck. I hope to see you again soon.
  830: |-
    I could sure use some money for medicine. I feel pretty weak - but if you can’t (cough, cough)
     spare any (cough), I guess I understand. Maybe next time, if I’m still around (cough) by then.
  850: |-
    You mean my much needed medicine? (hic) Well, I used to buy it at either the Golden Gecko or
     the Buckner Place (urp), but they won’t sell it to me until I pay some money on my bill. Lucky for
     me, Whiskey Bob's been making a bit of medicine for some of his friends.
  851: I’m glad you found a source for your medicine. I guess that’s all I need to
    know for now.
  852: Interesting. Where would I find this Whiskey Bob?
  853: Thanks, Aldo. Tell me about something else, though.
  860: |-
    Whiskey Bob is usually (urp) at Buckner’s Place right here in downtown. I don't think he's
     been able to get out to tend his still lately. He's just not a reliable source of medicine for someone
     as (hic) unwell as myself.
  861: Thanks for the information, Aldo. That’s about all I need to know.
  862: |-
    Glad you found another supplier. Uh, could you breathe a bit more downwind? I’ve got another
     question for you.
  870: |-
    Hello there, Friend -- you look a bit perplexed. What you need is an friend here in town. I’m
     Aldo, the town greeter.
  871: 'Friend? Heh, heh, '
  872: " like friend."
  873: Urk, (sniff, sniff) bad smell. Go away now.
  880: |-
    If you give me $20 I’ll be your friend and I’ll make sure everyone else is, too. That’s how it
     works here in the big city.
  881: Toowa-eee-nty? Ook?  Beeg Cee-tee? Ook?
  882: Give man pretty leaf now?
  890: A Geck? Heck, you mean a gecko. Never heard about a geck but I’ll tell you
    about geckos.
  900: |-
    Old stuff, huh? (urp) Well the only (hic) trader I know who trades much old stuff is
     (hic) Vic.
  901: Vic? Where can I find this Vic?
  910: |-
    Well now (hic), I haven’t seen Vic for a while. I don’t rightly (urp) know where he might have
     run off to. You might talk to (urp) Jenny over at the bath house. She and Vic were pretty (hic) thick.
     Heh, heh, heh. Get it? Oh my, I haven’t lost my touch.
  911: |-
    It’s nice to know that no matter how low you sink, you can’t lose something you never had. Let
     me risk asking you something else.
  912: Thankfully, you’re one-of-a-kind, Aldo. I guess that’s all I need to know.
KCARDIN:
  100: You see a sturdy, older woman with a tired smile.
  101: You see Ardin Buckner, the owner of Buckner house.
  102: You see a very fit and vivacious woman in her early fifties.
  110: |-
    You found my Smiley -- thank you so much! I just about gave him up for dead. I’m so angry with
     him! With him back I guess we won’t need Sulik anymore.
  111: Gecko bit Smiley. Smiley owie.
  112: I was happy to help out. I’m glad you’re letting Sulik go.
  113: I think he might still prefer you to the geckos. Tell me about something else
    though.
  114: Well, don’t be too hard on him. He wasn’t exactly enjoying himself, you know.
    Goodbye.
  120: |-
    I hear you hurt my boy Torr. I don’t know exactly what happened, but I don’t want you anywhere
     near here. Now get out.
  130: Hello there. My name’s Ardin Buckner and this is Buckner house.
  131: Argl. Goop
  132: Pretty, pretty house.
  140: |-
    You remind me of my boy Torr. I bet the two of you would get along just fine. Why don’t you run
     and talk to him? Goodbye.
  150: |-
    Hello there. My name’s Ardin Buckner and this is my place. Say, you didn’t see a trapper named
     Smiley outside of town did you? (Half to herself) He’s been gone for too long. Never should have let
     him go off on that fool quest of his.
  151: Smiley? No, I haven’t seen a trapper by that name. Tell me about him.
  152: I need something else right now.
  153: Hello, Ardin. I think I’ll be moving along now. Goodbye.
  160: |-
    You should talk to my daughter, Maida, about that. I don’t really keep track of what’s going on
     lately. Too much just keeping an eye on my own business.
  161: Oh, okay, I’ll do that. Right now, though, I need some information about something
    else.
  162: Well, I’ll talk to her about that then. Goodbye.
  170: You better not be planning any mischief here. What do you want?
  171: How can I help you, friend?
  172: Tell me about Smiley, the trapper.
  173: I was wondering if you’re the person to talk to about local news and events?
  174: I need a room, please.
  175: We need a room, please.
  176: I want to buy something.
  177: I guess I don’t need anything right now. Goodbye.
  180: |-
    Well, Smiley and me were getting downright serious with each other. I thought I had finally
     gotten him to agree to settle down here and help me run this place. But, he said he needed to go off
     on one last quest.
  181: A quest?
  190: I just handle the rooms here. If you want to buy or trade something, talk to
    my daughter, Maida.
  191: Oh, I see. Tell me something else then.
  192: Thanks. Goodbye.
  200: We’re pretty full right now. Sorry.
  201: Well, let’s see here. We should have a room available. That will be $25.
  202: I’ll take it. Here’s the $25. Thanks.
  203: I don’t think I want that right now. Let me ask you something else.
  204: I don’t think I need the room after all. Goodbye.
  210: I’m afraid you don’t have enough money for that.
  211: Oops. I guess I am a bit light right now. Let me ask you something else.
  212: I’m sorry. I better go make some more. Goodbye.
  220: Thank you. I’m so happy you helped find my boy. I thought we’d never see his
    fool self again.
  221: Torr friend.
  222: I was happy to help.
  223: Wasn’t there something mentioned about a reward?
  230: |-
    Well, thank you. I think you might need someone with a few more smarts to help look after you -
     a travelling companion. I’ll talk to Maida about freeing up Sulik.
  231: Well, I just don’t know what we could ever do to thank you.
  232: 'Torr friend '
  233: No thanks is necessary. Help was needed and I was there.
  234: Well, money is always a nice way of saying thanks.
  235: If you could consider Sulik’s debt paid, that would be reward enough.
  236: ". Sulik friend?"
  240: |-
    I’ll talk to Maida and she’ll take care of things with Sulik. You might want to talk to her
     also, though.
  241: 'Maida free Sulik. Maida '
  242: |-
    Thank-you. I’m sure Sulik will be grateful for your forgiving his debt to you. I’ll talk to
     Maida right away. Goodbye.
  243: I’m glad that you don’t need Sulik anymore. There’s something I want to ask
    you.
  244: " friend."
  250: |-
    I don’t have much, but here’s $100. I wish it could be more, but with all the Brahmin we’ve
     lost that’s all we can afford. I’m sorry.
  251: Thanks Ms. Buckner. Goodbye.
  252: Maybe I should take a different reward.
  260: |-
    Well, surely there must be something that I can do to show you how grateful I am. Hmm, I’ll
     forgive Sulik’s debt. He’s free to go. I guess that not all tribals are troublemakers.
  261: That sounds good to me. Goodbye.
  262: Hmm, maybe I should take a different reward.
  270: |-
    I just don’t know what to think. My boy Torr’s missing. I sure wish someone would help me find
     him. He’s never been gone from home so long before.
  271: Torr?
  272: What happened?
  273: That’s nice, lady, but I need something from you.
  274: Well, I can tell you’re busy. I’ll come back later. Goodbye.
  280: |-
    He took off last night. I got mad at him after we lost those last few brahmin. We just can’t
     afford to lose any more, but all he would talk about is the bugmen taking them. That fool boy.
  281: Torr go?
  282: |-
    I think that the Duntons had something to do with the missing brahmin. You shouldn’t be too
     hard on Torr about it. Where do you think he went?
  283: Where do you think he went?
  290: "Well, he kept saying that he was going to go get the bugmen where they live.
    You see, there’s\n a canyon just east of the field where we graze the brahmin.
    Lately, there’ve been some strange noises\n coming from there. "
  291: Noises?
  300: |-
    Thank you for promising to look for my boy. I sure hope you can find him. I’m so worried about
     him. Hurry, please.
  301: Ok.
  310: |-
    Have you found my boy yet? I don’t know how long he can last out there on his own. Please find
     him for me.
  311: Torr?
  312: I haven’t given up yet, but there’s something I need first.
  313: I just wanted to see if he had come back yet. I’ll continue searching. Goodbye.
  320: |-
    Torr was sure that’s where the bugmen that he said were taking our brahmin came from. Said
     something about proving himself to us. I just wish someone would bring my boy back to me.
  321: 'Torr canyon. '
  322: No go Torr.
  323: |-
    Sounds as though that canyon would be a good place to start looking. I’ll go look for your boy,
     Mrs. Buckner.
  324: |-
    I’d love to help -- if I weren’t quite so busy. I’m sure Torr will be alright on his own.
     Goodbye.
  325: " go Torr."
  330: |-
    Well, he called it a quest. He told me he thought he knew where all the golden geckos came from,
     and he wanted to find out for sure. He thought that maybe it was some kind of magical spring, or maybe
     a hidden cave or vault of some sort.
  331: Hmmm.
  340: |-
    Well, I don’t rightly know what all he said, but he seemed real excited about going. But I
     shouldn’t have let him go. He’s two weeks later getting back than he said he’d be and I’m worried.
  341: I’d like to help. I could look for him for you.
  342: Sorry to hear that. Let me ask you about something else.
  343: "That’s too bad, Mrs. Buckner. Maybe he just ran out on you. I think I know
    why he would, too.\n Goodbye. "
  350: |-
    Oh, thank you. Let me mark on your map where he talked about looking. I sure hope you can
     find him. He isn’t much, but I still love him and I miss him more than I thought I could. Please find
     him for me.
  351: I’ll do what I can. Let me ask you something first, though.
  352: I’ll do my best, Mrs. Buckner. Goodbye
  353: You know, I just don’t think I can help you right now. Goodbye.
  360: Have you found my Smiley yet?
  361: Sorry, Mrs. Buckner. I’m still looking for him. Let me ask you something else
    first, though.
  362: No, I’m just about to go look for him though. Goodbye.
  370: |-
    I think something horrible must have happened to my poor boy, Torr. I was counting on you (sob)
     to find him before it was too late. That poor simple boy. I can’t believe I counted on you.
  371: |-
    I wish you could have helped search for my poor boy, Torr. He was such a gentle soul and now
     he’s surely dead. I’ll miss him so.
  372: |-
    Sorry, Mrs. Buckner. I tried my best to find him for you. Uh, there was something I wanted
     though.
  373: Maybe I can help recover what’s left of his body for you. Goodbye.
  374: Torr? Who Torr? (you shrug) Goodbye.
  375: |-
    I’m sorry -- I wanted to help, but I couldn’t. Uh, I hate to mention it at a time like this,
     but there’s something that I want.
  376: I guess I should come back at another time. Goodbye.
  380: |-
    Well, somehow that doesn’t surprise me much. Oh my, I yelled at my poor boy when it wasn’t
     even his fault. (sob) I’ll get those Duntons. They’ve gone too far this time.
  381: I’m sorry about that. Where do you think Torr went?
  390: Ok.
  400: Have you found my Smiley yet?
  401: Who? Oh, uh, no. I don't know where he went. Uh, say, let me ask you about
    something else.
  402: He's dead. He was eaten by geckos.
  403: I, uh, saw him. He said he was running off with another woman. Whoa! Look at
    the time. I've gotta run.
  404: Uh, I, uh, we, that is...Uh, no. I'm still looking for him. I'm sure he'll
    show up any day now. Uh, Goodbye.
  410: Eaten by geckos? I just don't believe you. Geckos would never catch my Smilely,
    he's too good a trapper for that. You must be mistaken.
  411: Yeah, you're probably right. Sorry for the scare. Let me ask you about something.
  412: Nope, I saw him, or what was left of him anyway. Not a pretty sight. Well,
    see ya later. Goodbye.
  413: I guess you've got me there. Heh, heh, I was just pulling your, ah, leg. Yeah,
    that's it. Well, Goodbye.
  420: I thought they were up to their usual tricks! My poor little Torr. I'll take
    care of those two bullies right away. They won't be doing that again. Thank you.
  421: Happy to help, ma'am. Let me ask you about something.
  422: Those Duntons make me sick. I'm glad you'll take care of them. Goodbye now.
  500: I think the Dunton brothers are rustling your brahmin. I just thought you should
    know, ma'am.
  510: |-
    You didn't see a trapper named Smiley outside of town did you? (half to herself) He's been gone for too
     long. Never should have let him go off on that fool quest of his.
  520: You've been so helpful with things around here. Thanks.
  530: I was just wondering what else is going on around here.
  600: You're wonderful.
  610: You're wonderful. You've returned my son Torr and my Smiley to me. I can't
    thank you enough.
  620: You've found my son Torr. Thank you so much.
  630: You're the one that found my Smiley. Thank you, thank you so much.
  640: I'm glad I could help you out. It'd be a shame to lose two people so close
    to you like that.
  650: Torr just needs a little help from time to time. I'm glad I was there for him.
  660: Smiley got lucky this time. You just tell him to be a bit more careful.
  670: Happy to help, Mrs. Buckner. Let me ask you about something.
  680: Gurrrrg bloop?
  690: Think nothing of it, ma'am. Goodbye.
  700: Torr's dead.
  710: Smiley's dead.
  720: I, uh, I don't know where they are. Say can I ask you a question?
  730: They're both dead as doornails.
  740: Torr left? What do you mean?
  750: I don't know where he is. Let me ask you something, maybe they'll return while
    we're talking.
  760: I'm still looking for them. I better get back to it. Goodbye.
  770: I'm still looking for him. I better get back to it. Goodbye.
  780: I uh, don't know where he is. Hmm... Wow, look at the time. I've got to go.
  790: Say, let me ask you something.
  800: Well, there's a lot of work for me to get to. Goodbye.
  810: Urrrrrgh.
  900: Have you found my son, Torr, yet? I'm so worried about him.
  910: Have you found my Smiley yet?
  920: Have you found my son, Torr, or my friend, Smiley the trapper, yet?
  930: My poor Torr's run off.
  940: I don't believe you.
  942: |-
    Oh, it's true. They're probably both worm food by now - well, the few scraps that haven't been turned
     into gecko shit anyway. Well, them's the breaks. See ya.
  943: Uh, I guess that was a bad *joke*, sorry.
  950: I don't want to talk to you.
  951: Get out of here.
  952: Damn, tribals. Nothing but trouble.
  953: Get out of here, you savage.
  954: I don't tolerate your kind here.
  955: You'll get nothing from me, tribal.
  956: You've enough harm here.
  957: Just leave me alone.
  958: Tribal troublemaker, get out of my place.
  959: I've had enough of you. Get out.
KCBOB:
  100: You see an older man with a scraggly beard and a big red nose.
  101: You see Whiskey Bob.
  110: Howdy, my name’s Whiskey Bob. What’s yours, fella?
  111: Ain’t you a cute little thing. My name’s Bob, Whiskey Bob -- what’s yours?
  112: Whicky Gob? Zug, zug?
  113: Shiny nose (heh, heh)
  114: 'Me '
  115: Goway
  120: You ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed, are ya? Well, nice talking to you
    anyhow. So long.
  121: |-
    Sweetheart, you break my heart every time you open your mouth. Maybe some other time I can
     take you back to Trapper Town and I’ll show you my etchings (heh, heh). Bye, cutie.
  130: Well, mister, maybe I’ll be seeing you around here later. Bye.
  131: Well, hope to see you again ‘round here, cute stuff. Goodbye
  140: Humph, if you’re not gonna be any drinking buddy of mine, then git.
  141: Humph, I think that I’d rather go to Sally’s bathhouse than spend time with
    you. Now git.
  150: Howdy stranger, my name’s Whiskey Bob. What’s yours?
  151: 'My name’s '
  152: ". Nice to meet you Whiskey Bob."
  153: 'I’m '
  154: ". What’s happening here in town?"
  155: I don’t think you need to know my name.
  160: |-
    Always nice to find another drinking buddy. Wanna buy me a drink? Talking always makes me
     thirsty.
  161: Sure, Bob. Don’t mind a bit.
  162: I can’t afford to right now.
  163: I don’t want to buy you a drink, Whiskey Bob.
  164: With a nickname like yours, Whiskey Bob, maybe you should be providing the
    drinks.
  170: |-
    Thanks for the drink, partner. Now that my whistle’s wet, I feel that I can share a little
     problem I have. Hey -- maybe you can help me out?
  171: Well, I’m pretty busy right now. I don’t think I can help you out.
  172: How can I help you out?
  173: If it won’t take too long, I guess I could help you. For a price, of course.
  174: I might be able to help you, as long as it’s not too dangerous.
  175: Anything unusual going on in town lately?
  180: Looks as though you’re purse has run dry. You don’t have enough money to buy
    old Bob a drink.
  181: "[MORE]"
  190: |-
    Well, you see, I have a little side business that I need some help attending to. I have a
     moonshine still outside of town that needs to be fueled up every so often. Since a gecko done bit my
     leg, I can’t hobble out to it before it runs out of fuel. If I tell you where it is, would you refuel
     it for me? It’s worth $50 to me.
  191: That doesn’t sound too bad -- tell me more.
  192: I don’t think I want to do that for you. Sorry, Whiskey Bob.
  200: |-
    Now then, it’s not going to take you too long and it’s not too dangerous at all. Probably. You
     want to hear about it or not?
  201: OK, go ahead and tell me about it.
  202: I think I’ve heard enough. Goodbye.
  210: |-
    Fair enough. You’re a sharp one, there’s no denying it. Here’s some booze. Now in return, you
     get to listen to my little problem.
  220: |-
    All you have to do is find a little shack just south of town. Go inside and dump some firewood
     into the still. Then come back here and I’ll give you your money. But it needs to be done within the
     next day, or my batch of hootch will go bad.
  221: That sounds pretty easy. OK, I’ll do it.
  222: I don’t want to help you with this. Sorry, Bob.
  223: "$50 doesn’t sound like nearly enough for a job like that."
  230: |-
    You’ll do it? Great. Remember, you gotta do it soon or my hootch will go bad. Thanks a heap.
     See you back here soon.
  231: 'No problem, Bob. See you in a day. '
  232: Happy to help. But first, tell me what’s going on in town lately.
  240: Well, you’re a sharp deal maker and there’s no denying it. OK, I’ll make it
    $65. Will you do it?
  241: 'Nice try there, but $50 is all the job’s worth to me. Heck, I can’t afford
    to pay any more. '
  242: OK, I’ll do it.
  243: I don’t want to do it for that money. My time’s worth much more.
  250: |-
    Hello there, feller. Back to see Whiskey Bob again, huh? Ready to talk about drinks and
     business and suchlike?
  251: |-
    Hey there, gal. Want to talk to Whiskey Bob again about drinks and business and such? I’ll
     let you sit on my lap! (heh, heh) Just kidding.
  252: Sure, Bob - tell me about drinks and business.
  253: I think I had enough of that the last time.
  260: |-
    Finished fueling my still? Naw, I don’t reckon that you have yet. Well be sure and come back
     when you have.
  270: |-
    Somebody done smashed up my still! And you’re the only person I told about it. Why, if I were
     a younger feller, more full of piss and vinegar, I’d have a mind to teach you a lesson. Just get out of
     my sight, you double-crosser!
  280: |-
    Well, thanks for refueling my still for me. Here’s your $50,
     too. Got any questions that I can answer for you?
  281: |-
    Thanks. Now I don’t have to gimp on out there myself -- even if it did cost me $65. Here’s your
     money. Any questions that I can answer for you?
  282: Yes. Tell me what’s going on in town lately.
  283: No thanks, Bob. I think I know what I need to already.
  290: |-
    All sorts of things going on hereabouts lately. We’ve got brahmin mutilators,  walking spirits,
     gigantical rats, and missing people. Some even say the Den’s involved.
  291: Tell me about the brahmin mutilations.
  292: Tell me all about the walking spirits.
  293: Gigantical rats? I’ve gotta hear more about those.
  294: A den? What kind of den?
  295: Missing people? Tell me more.
  296: |-
    I need to ask you about something else. Have you ever heard of something called a Garden of Eden
     Creation Kit?
  297: I don’t think I need to listen to all of that right now.
  298: Sure, Bob, and let me tell you about a fish as tall as I am that I caught in
    a rain barrel.
  310: |-
    Thanks for helping me out with my still. I should be able to do it myself when my leg heals
     just a bit. Have any questions for an old bar-hound like myself?
  311: Well, I have been wondering about some of the rumors I’ve heard around town.
  312: I don’t think I need any more information just now, Bob.
  320: |-
    They say that critters that look like giant man-shaped bugs, in a shell and everything, are
     mutilating brahmin at night. All they find are the torn open, horribly hacked up brahmin corpses.
  321: That sounds horrible.
  330: |-
    A few people have seen the bugmen, but the one who’s got the best look was Torr, the Buckner’s
     boy. What he saw scared him half out of his wits, and the poor lad is a bit shy in that department
     already.
  331: Incredible! Let me ask about something else.
  332: I think that’s all I need to hear for now, good-bye.
  340: |-
    There’s a canyon just to the west of town that had a bright light in it a few months back. Ever
     since, every now and then, there’s been a horrible squealing sound that comes from the canyon. Brahmin
     that wander in don’t come back. Everyone’s afraid to get too near.
  341: |-
    Yes, surely a sign of spirit infestation. If only you had a competent shaman. Tell me about
     something else.
  342: That’s enough for now. I think I’ll just ponder on this for a while. Goodbye.
  350: |-
    Well, out back of Trapper Town, just to the west of downtown, there’s a back section that’s
     overrun by rats. The further back you, go the bigger they get. Some say that there’s one huge great
     rat spirit that’s leading them all. Some of the trappers won’t even stay there anymore. They say it’s
     too dangerous.
  351: Trappers ousted by rats? Tell me about some of the other things.
  352: |-
    Afraid of rats. Hmm, must be different rats than the ones we have at home. I’ve heard enough.
     Good-bye.
  360: |-
    Not ‘A den,’ - ‘The Den.’ You’ll not find a greater hive of scum and villainy. Now where did I
     hear that? In any case, it’s a rough sort of place a few days travel south of Klamath. Anything can
     be had there for a price...even slaves. But you have to be very careful there -— lots of short tempers
     attached to dangerous weapons. I don’t think they have much to do with us, though; we’re too poor here.
  361: |-
    I think I’d be safe enough there; I know how to handle myself. Let me ask you about something
     else, though.
  362: I’ve heard enough for now, Whiskey Bob. Goodbye.
  370: |-
    Lately, we’ve had a couple of people go missing. A trader, named Vic, who specialized in
     pre-war stuff, and one of our best trappers.
  371: Tell me more about the trader some call…Vic?
  372: I want to know more about the trapper.
  373: Let me ask you about something else.
  374: That’s all I need to know. Goodbye, Whiskey Bob.
  380: |-
    Well, Vic was quite a fella. He didn’t like to work too much, so he would specialize in
     expensive pre-war things and then go sell them to the Den -- or even hawk them to stupid tribals as
     religious artifacts (chuckles to himself). Oops, no offense. Anyhow, I haven’t seen him for a while.
     Last I heard, he went south to sell some stuff. Maybe to the Den.
  381: What about the missing trapper?
  382: Let me ask you about something else, Bob.
  383: Thanks, I’ve got to think on what you’ve told me. Goodbye, Whiskey Bob.
  390: |-
    The real person to tell you about the missing trapper would be Mrs. Buckner. She and Smiley
     were pretty close. He went north to look for the cave of the golden geckos and hasn’t been seen since.
     That was a while back, too.
  391: What about the missing trader?
  392: Hmm, intersting. Tell me about something else, though.
  393: That’s enough for me for now. Goodbye, Whiskey Bob.
  400: |-
    I sure wish you had kept your word to me. You didn’t get to my still in time and my latest
     batch of hootch is plum ruined! I don’t want to have anything more to do with you and I hope no one
     else does, either.
  401: But I, I thought I had more time….
  402: It probably tastes the same whether I refueled the still or not.
  403: Your hootch tastes like dogpiss anyway.
  404: The fuel didn’t seem to provide a flame of the correct temperature for proper
    fermentation.
  410: |-
    I don’t want to hear your damn excuses. Just get the heck out of my sight! But I’ll tell you
     one thing; everyone’s going to know just how worthless your word is before I’m through.
  420: |-
    A Garden of Eden Creation Kit? Why I think I saw one of those listed on a page of an old
     catalog I was looking through while I was sitting down, out back. But I don’t know much more about it
     than that.
  421: Really? I’d like to see that catalog.
  430: |-
    Uh, (embarrassed) I kind of used that page to take care of some business, if you know what I
     mean.
  431: |-
    Business? Oh, that kind of business. I prefer old newspaper, myself. Oh well, tell me something
     else, then.
  432: Damn, I thought I was so close. I guess that’s enough disappointment for now.
    Goodbye, Bob.
  500: Howdy, what can I do for you?
  501: What is going on around here?
  502: Nothing, thanks.
  550: Bob doesn't seem to want to talk to you.
KCDUNTON:
  100: |-
    You see one of two very similar looking men--they could be twins.
     Both are heavily muscled and have beetling brows.
  101: You see either Chuck or Buck Dunton, they both look so much alike that you’re
    not sure which one you’re looking at right now.
  102: |-
    You see a tall, heavily muscled man whose face, beneath his beetling brow, is habitually
     twisted into a bully’s smirking scowl. He looks just like his brother.
  110: You just better push off, or my brother and I are going to pound you’re little
    head into jam.
  111: |-
    Hey, take it easy. I was just kidding around. I’m really sorry. Don’t hit me, please.
     Besides, I wanted to ask you two about something.
  112: Uh, sorry, Mr. Dunton, sir. I’ll be leaving now.
  113: I need some information, and you just better tell me what I need to know.
  114: You and your brother? Are you afraid to take me on all alone? (Cluck, cluck,
    cluck)
  120: Just get out before we smash you flat and turn you into drymeat.
  121: |-
    Hey, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. I’m just stupid. I’ll come back later when
     you’re not so sick of looking at me.
  122: Oh, okay, sorry. Don’t hit me. Please.
  123: At least I won’t have to look at your butt-ugly faces anymore.
  130: What do you want to know from us?
  131: I don’t think we need to tell you anything. What the heck do you want, anyway?
  132: So, what’s the little wimp want from us, anyway?
  133: Either of you ever hear about something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?
  134: I’d like to barter.
  135: Any work around here?
  136: Uh, just which Dunton are you, anyway?
  137: Have you heard anything about brahmin mutilations around here?
  138: I guess I don’t need anything after all. Goodbye.
  140: You went way over the line. I think you just better get out of here before
    we teach you a lesson.
  141: I’m sorry, I just got so excited working with you two. I’ll leave now. Goodbye.
  142: Line? What line? It was your idea in the first place.
  143: You two are just too yellow to do what needed to be done.
  150: |-
    Well, we have a good supply of our world famous Dunton’s Drymeat on hand. Tasty and delicious -
     good for you, too.
  151: 'Uh, that’s great. '
  152: Drymeat? That doesn’t sound like what I need. Tell me something else.
  153: I don’t think I need to barter after all. Goodbye.
  160: You had your chance, pal.
  161: I don’t think there’s any work for you here.
  162: Well, there is one thing that we could use some help with. (Heh, heh, heh)
  163: What’s that Chuck?
  164: What’s that Buck?
  165: Uh, what’s that?
  166: Oh, yeah. Well, tell me something else then.
  167: Hey, wait - I really do want to help you guys out. Tell me about that job again.
  168: Well, I guess I missed out. I’ll be going then. Goodbye.
  169: Okay. Bye.
  170: You worthless sack of gecko shit! Just what the hell are doing in our sight
    again?
  171: |-
    I just wanted to apologize. I didn’t mean to screw up. I’m just not as good at rustling as you
     two. Besides, I need something from you.
  172: |-
    Well, you’re right - I could have done a better job. I guess I’m not a natural rustler like
     you two are. I need something, though.
  173: Gecko shit? Are we talking about what you eat, or what you use for brains?
  180: Back again, huh? Well, what can we help you with, business partner?
  181: |-
    Hey there, pal. That sure was a sweet job we pulled on that dumb-ass Torr, huh? Let me get your
     cut of the action.
  182: "That was a sweet deal. Let me know when you’ve got another job like that one
    lined up. I need\n something else right now, though. "
  183: I’m here for my cut, partners.
  184: |-
    What we did made me ashamed of myself. Cheating an idiot? Why don’t you cowards take on someone
     who can defend themselves for a change? Goodbye.
  185: I guess I don’t really need anything right now. Goodbye.
  190: |-
    OK - here’s the $50 and a little something extra for you, as well. A few sticks of Dunton’s
     Drymeat. Thanks again, partner.
  191: Thanks. Hey, there’s something else that I want to know.
  192: I can sure use that money. Mmm, (bite) tasty jerky, too. Thanks. Goodbye.
  198: |-
    OK, here’s the deal. We need some help in, uh, liberating some brahmin from that idiot Torr.
     You can try to talk him out of the brahmin, or knock him out - just don’t hurt him too bad or it’ll
     stir up a ruckus.
  199: 'Now I remember. Thanks. '
  200: Meet us at the brahmin grazing area, just to the east of town, at 6:00 PM tonight.
  201: Meet us at the brahmin grazing area, just to the east of town, at 6:00 PM tomorrow
    night.
  202: 'OK, I’ll take care of Torr. '
  203: 'OK, I’ll find Torr at the grazing area and take care of him for you. '
  204: I don’t think I want to do that after all.
  205: OK, I’ll be there. Goodbye.
  206: In the meantime, though, there's something that I want to know.
  207: Goodbye.
  208: I’m Chuck Dunton. What are you? Dumb?
  209: I’m Buck Dunton. What are you? Dumb?
  210: Do I look especially ugly? I’m Chuck Dunton.
  211: Do I look especially ugly? I’m Buck Dunton.
  212: Are you slow in the head? I’m Chuck Dunton.
  213: Are you slow in the head? I’m Buck Dunton.
  214: You just can’t get it straight. Damn simpleton tribals. I’m Chuck, you dumb-ass.
  215: You just can’t get it straight. Damn simpleton tribals. I’m Buck, you dumb-ass.
  216: I’m Big Nose Sally Dunton. Do you like my dress? I’m Chuck Dunton, you stupid
    tribal.
  217: I’m Big Nose Sally Dunton. Do you like my dress? I’m Buck Dunton, you stupid
    tribal.
  218: Uh, okay. Yeah, I thought so. Sorry.
  219: Don’t worry. I have it now. I need something from you, uh, Mr. Dunton.
  220: Yeah, whoever. Look, just tell me what I need to know.
  221: |-
    Well, you’re both so damn stupid and ugly. Besides, I don’t give a flying fuck which Dunton
     I’m yelling at. Goodbye, asshole.
  222: Uh, yeah. Well, tell me about the job.
  230: |-
    Word to the wise - you just better not say nuthin’ to nobody. ‘Cause if’n you do, that would
     make us very angry. You don’t want to see us angry.
  231: Sorry, I won’t tell anyone. I promise, Mr. Dunton, sir. Goodbye.
  232: Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. Now tell me something else.
  233: Don’t want to see you angry? I don’t want to see your ugly mugs at all. Goodbye.
  240: Well, it’s a pleasure doing business with you. Heh, heh, heh. Need anything
    else?
  241: Hmm...I think I forgot to barter for something.
  242: Yes, I do.
  243: No, I think that’s it for now, Chuck.
  244: No, I think that’s it for now, Buck.
  250: Hey there, partner. Still counting on you for tonight. What can I do for you?
  251: Uh, I’ve reconsidered. I don’t think I want to help you tonight.
  252: Yup. I’ll be there. Let me ask you something, though.
  253: Sure I will. Goodbye.
  259: Well, if it isn’t our burly-armed chum.
  260: Hey there. How’s your arm coming? Ready to go again?
  261: |-
    Hey there, you little squirt. What are you doing in our bar? You have to prove yourself to the
     Duntons by arm-wrestling me before we’ll let you stay. (ha ha ha)
  262: |-
    You don’t look so darn tough. Why don’t you arm-wrestle me, Chuck Dunton, for the right to drink
     in our bar?
  263: |-
    You don’t look so darn tough. Why don’t you arm-wrestle me, Buck Dunton, for the right to drink
     in our bar?
  264: |-
    Hey there, goody-two-shoes. You’ve gotta earn your admittance to our bar. You’ve gotta
     arm-wrestle me, Chuck Dunton.
  265: |-
    Hey there, goody-two-shoes. You’ve gotta earn your admittance to our bar. You’ve gotta
     arm-wrestle me, Buck Dunton.
  266: |-
    Hey, looks like we’ve got ourselves a contender here. You’ve gotta arm-wrestle me, Chuck Dunton,
     if you want to drink in here.
  267: |-
    Hey, looks like we’ve got ourselves a contender here. You’ve gotta arm-wrestle me, Buck Dunton,
     if you want to drink in here.
  268: Let’s arm-wrestle. I guess that’s the only way I’ll get some peace in here.
  269: I don’t think I want to arm-wrestle you right now.
  270: I don’t want to wrestle right now. All I want is some information.
  271: Uh, I think I’m in the wrong bar. Goodbye.
  280: |-
    You won this time. Well, aren’t you a tricky little cuss? Quick as a gecko with its tail set
     on fire. Well, the first drink’s on me.
  281: Thanks. Maybe you can tell me something I want to know.
  282: I just got lucky this time. Thanks.
  283: I don’t really need your beer, thanks. Let me ask you something, though.
  284: I don’t think I want your beer. Goodbye.
  290: |-
    You’re lucky I didn’t snap your little arm like a dried twig. (Hyuk, hyk, hyuk) Well, I guess
     there’s still no challenge here in town.
  291: Haven’t you had enough abuse for one evening?
  292: I want to take you on again. I’ll show you this time.
  293: Ouch. okay, okay, I’ve had enough. Hey, let me ask you something.
  294: That’s it for me. Goodbye.
  300: |-
    Don’t want to arm wrestle us? What, you think you’re too good to arm-wrestle against one of the
     Dunton brothers?
  301: I think you’d hurt me if I arm-wrestled you.
  302: Maybe later. Right now, I need some information.
  303: It wouldn’t even be a contest. I’d win. Goodbye.
  304: You look too wimpy. I only arm-wrestle real men. Take off, you hoser.
  310: |-
    You’re looking for a what? Close as I ever get to the Garden of Eden is in lovely Jenny’s arms
     over at Ma’s bathhouse. (hyuk, hyuk, hyuk)
  311: Uh, thanks. Let me ask you something else, then.
  312: I guess that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  320: |-
    Well, I hear that they’re some (hyuk, hyuk) bug-men cutting up brahmin out east of us. But I
     wouldn’t believe everything you hear. (hyuk, hyuk, hyuk).
  321: Oh, I see; thanks. There’s something else I wanted to know about.
  322: I guess that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  330: Hello there. You here to barter for some of our World Famous Dunton’s Drymeat?
  331: Well? You here to buy some drymeat or what?
  332: That sounds great. I’d like to barter.
  333: Drymeat? That sounds interesting. Tell me more about that.
  334: Actually, I had some questions for you.
  335: I don’t think I need anything right now thanks. Goodbye.
  336: |-
    I was curious about all those brahmin you have out back. They don’t all seem to have the same
     brand on them.
  340: Huh? What the hell do you mean? They’re all ours.
  341: |-
    What I mean is that some of them look as though they have a different brand that someone’s
     clumsily branded over.
  342: Oh, I see. Heh-heh, I must have made a mistake. I’ll be going now. Goodbye.
  343: |-
    Well, I guess I just don’t know much about brahmin. Must be their coloration or something.
     Fine-looking brahmin you have here.
  350: |-
    Well, our drymeat is an incredible blend of eleven herbs and spices. Let me tell you, it’s
     finger-lickin’ good. Animals love it, too. They’ll chase you from all over to get some. Must be that
     rotting smell.
  351: There’s nothing else like it. Anywhere. It’s you-neek. And most people are
    happy it’s like that.
  352: |-
    It’s PEOPLE! Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk, just wanted to see your face when I said that. Heck, it’s only
     part people. Hyuk, hyuk.
  353: |-
    It’s not like anything that most people would eat. It’s different. Not better, just
     different.
  354: |-
    No cruelty to animals involved here. This is all found meat. Sometimes it takes us a while to
     find it, but usually we can home in on the stink.
  355: After a long day in the brahmin pen, we get some choice boot scrapings to flavor
    it with.
  356: "Well, we’ve found that a sauce made by us personally, if ya’ know what I mean,
    gives it that\n down-home taste. "
  357: It’s made from beef aged over six months and tenderized by the choicest horsefly
    maggots.
  358: |-
    Incredible. It sounds as though you actually eat your own drymeat. Uh, what I mean to say is,
     who wouldn’t? Yum-yum.
  359: Really? That’s fascinating. Tell me more.
  360: I think that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  361: |-
    If I were starving to death, I’d rather hack off my own arm and eat it than your damn
     drymeat.
  370: |-
    You here because you changed your mind? You want to help save those poor little brahmin from
     Torr?
  371: |-
    What the heck are you doing here? You here to help us or not? We might have a job for you
     if you’re interested.
  372: Yeah, I’m interested. Tell me about this job.
  373: I don’t think I want anything to do with you two. Goodbye.
  374: I thought I saw a pile of bug parts over there. Do you know what that is?
  380: What the heck do you want? Did you forget what you’re supposed to be doing?
  381: No. I remember. I’ll get busy with our plan.
  382: |-
    Are you crazy? They’re on to us. I’m here to warn you not to go through with it. I bet they’re
     watching us right now.
  383: I forgot; would you go over the plan again for me? Please.
  384: I thought I saw a pile of bug parts over there. Do you know what that is?
  390: Bug parts? Umm, err, ah, we don’t know nuthin’ about no bug parts. What are
    you talking about?
  391: |-
    Well, I saw a pile of bug parts that had straps and buckles so that they looked as though they
     could be worn like a costume. They were all piled right over by where you two were standing.
  392: Uh, just forget it. Goodbye.
  400: Here’s what’s happening. You need to get Torr.
  401: Sounds good, I’ll do it.
  402: Not a chance; I’m outa here, Dunton. Goodbye.
  403: |-
    Are you crazy? They’re on to us. I’m here to warn you not to go through with it. I bet they’re
     watching us right now.
  404: When Torr shows up, we need you to get him
  405: |2-
     out of here for a while. You can talk to him or knock him unconscious. But don’t kill him or
     you’ll get people all riled up. While you do that, we’ll get the brahmin. Meet us back at our shop
     tomorrow to pick up your reward.
  410: Maybe you’re right. (looking around quickly) I don’t like the idea of someone
    watching me.
  411: You should be kinder to others of your own kind. Now go home.
  420: "Nobody’s watching us. We’re real careful about that. You’re just yellow, aren’t
    you? Frigging\n coward. "
  421: Sorry, I guess I was just getting nervous. I’m not as cool under pressure as
    you two are.
  422: Sorry, I panicked. I’ll get back to work, then.
  423: Not a chance. I’m leaving. Goodbye.
  424: Now get back to your job and get rid of that idiot Torr!
  430: |-
    You’re crazy. Those are just left over from some radscorpions we killed. Yeah, that’s it.
     That’s the ticket. We, uh, umm, use their venom as one of the secret ingredients in our drymeat recipe.
  431: Yeah, sure. I’ll believe that as soon as the sun rises in the west.
  432: Well, if you say so. That’s good enough for me. Goodbye.
  440: You just better keep your mouth shut if you know what’s good for you.
  441: |-
    Geez, take it easy. I was just going to tell you what a great idea I thought it was. Sheesh,
     calm down.
  442: Sorry. I will. Goodbye.
  443: Yeah, well, I’m taking off. Goodbye.
  444: |-
    Yeah, I think you just better shut your mouth for a change. I’m tired of hearing you flap your
     rotten gums.
  449: 'Hello there, tribal. '
  450: I’m Chuck Dunton.
  451: I’m Buck Dunton.
  452: Oooogly man.
  453: " Chosen one!"
  460: |-
    Ooogly ann? Huh? You’re just as dumb as that idiot Torr. That’s good, we need a new fricking
     village idiot in town. We’ve just about used that Torr up.
  461: Torr up?
  470: |-
    Chosen one, huh? Chosen most likely to be punched in the mouth. Did your momma drop you on the
     head, or did you just come out that dumb and ugly? Get the hell away from me.
  471: 'Ook! '
  472: " Chosen one!"
  480: You ready to go? Well, come on then. We don’t have all damn night. We’ve got
    work to do.
  481: Uh, yeah; I’m ready. Let’s go.
  482: I’m ready to teach that idiot herdboy a lesson.
  483: 'I don’t think I want to do this. See you later. '
  490: Hey, just wait until we get inside; then we can talk.
  500: You struggle, but eventually the Dunton brother wins.
  510: You manage to beat the Dunton brother after a tough struggle.
  520: Ok.
  530: Get the hell out of here. Some of us gots work to do.
  531: Oh, OK. I guess I'll be moving on then. Sheesh, some people are so touchy.
    Goodbye.
  532: Torr grazes his Brahmin just north of Downtown here.
  533: When that Dumb-ass Torr gets here, you just better get rid of him.
  600: Even idiot Torr has got more brains than you, thief!
  601: " Ready to go?"
  700: You have rustled the brahmin successfully.
KCHILD:
  100: You see one of Klamath's Children.
  101: You see one of Klamath's Children.
  150: Don't eat me!
  151: Eeeee! The boogy-monster!
  152: Daddy says you're a bad person.
  153: Aieeee! Run away!
  154: You're scaring me.
  155: Stop looking at me.
  156: I'm not supposed to talk to tribals.
  157: You're just like the Duntons.
  158: My mom said you'll eat me if I'm bad.
  159: I'm not afraid of you!
  160: Help meee!
  161: It's after me!
  162: Please don't hurt me!
  163: Stay away from me!
  164: Eeeeeeeee!
  165: I hate you!
  166: Mommy, mommy, mommy!
  167: Leave me alone!
  168: You stink!
  170: Hello there.
  171: Want to play house?
  172: Do you really poke a bone through your nose?
  173: How come you're so funny looking?
  174: My mom says you're primitive.
  175: Has your tribe stopped eating people?
  176: Who dressed you so funny?
  177: I'll bet you're nicer than you look.
  178: Let's play tag. You're it.
  179: You don't smell that bad.
  180: Have you seen my invisible friend?
  181: I want to travel the world when I'm as old as you.
  182: You’re a nice tribal, not like the others.
  183: I bet you do to bathe.
  184: You’re smarter than Torr.
  185: Is that blade you have really sharp?
  186: I want to be just like you when I grow up.
  187: My dog loves drymeat.
  188: I’ve got a shiny pebble.
  189: Have you seen my invisible friend?
  190: Can I join your tribe?
  191: You're nice.
  192: You look funny.
  193: Whatcha wearing?
  194: I want a brahmin ride!
  195: Are you from far away?
  196: Weeee! Ha Ha Ha!
  197: Don't leave!
  198: Do you have some food?
  199: Am I bothering you?
  200: Where ya going?
  201: Can I come with you?
  202: How old are you?
  203: What's your name?
  204: Do you like kids?
  205: What is that?
  206: Do you wanna play a game?
  207: Whatcha doing?
  208: Have you seen any bugs?
  209: Where did you get that?
  210: Can I have that?
  211: What do you do?
  212: I can run fast. Wanna see?
  213: Watch me! Watch me!
  214: Mommy says I talk to much.
  215: Where is your home?
  216: Heeee! Heeee!
  217: Are you gonna stay here?
  218: Do you have kids?
  219: Why did you come here?
  220: I like you.
  221: Do you like me?
  222: Are you married?
  223: One, two, three - weee!

KCJENNY:
  100: You see an attractive, but tired, young woman.
  101: You see Jenny, the bath attendant.
  200: |-
    Gee, mister, that was pretty quick. You must be pretty new at this sort of thing. Just relax a
     bit and you’ll enjoy it more.
  201: Thanks, Jenny; I guess I need some more practice at this.
  210: That was nice. You seem like you know your way around a woman better than most
    men your age.
  211: I’m glad that you had as much fun as I did.
  220: |-
    You really have a lot of staying power. That’s the nice thing about younger men. Sure wish
     there were more like you in town.
  221: |-
    I sure enjoyed that bath, Jenny. I could go for a little more if I didn’t have other things
     that I had to do.
  230: |-
    Well, that was different. I hope you come back; I think I’d like to experiment with some ideas
     of my own next time.
  231: It’s nice being with someone who understands what I need for a change.
  240: |-
    That sure was fun. You could be a real knockout if we got you out of those tribal duds. I
     wouldn’t mind having you stick around for a while, sister. Ever considered a career change?
  241: |-
    I enjoyed myself, too. I have a lot of things to do before I could consider settling down just
     yet. But, thanks anyway.
  250: You're different from the usual group around here.
  251: Tell me about what goes on here.
  252: I don’t think I want to know about what goes on here.
  260: Well, it’s been nice chattin’ with you. I better get ready for another customer,
    though. Goodbye.
  270: You look a little confused. My name’s Jenny; can I help you?
  271: Enny? Goo heh heh heh. (smile)
  272: "(nods) Hep "
  273: " perdy Enny"
  274: Mommy?
  280: |-
    Hmm, I think you just better clear out of here before Big Nose Sally finds you. She doesn’t
     take kindly to idjits in her place.
  290: What would you like to know?
  291: Tell me about trappers.
  292: I’m looking for a trader. Know any of them that deal in old items, like from
    the beforetimes?
  293: Do you happen to know how to get to the Den from here?
  294: Bye.
  295: Jenny, have you ever heard of something called a GECK?
  300: |-
    Well, there’s not much to tell about the trappers, really. They get a few gecko pelts...or get
     lucky with a few golden geckos...and then they come in to blow off some steam. Quick and not too
     demanding —- just the way I like ‘em.
  301: I guess that’s all I need to know for now.
  302: Interesting; let me ask you about something else.
  310: |-
    You’re interested in traders, huh? Well I mostly just worked for one trader. Vic was his name.
     He always had extra money to blow, at least when he worked he did. See, he specialized in really old stuff. You know,
     technical thingies.
  311: Well, thanks for the info. I think I’ll go now.
  312: Tell me more about Vic.
  313: Let me ask you about something else.
  320: |-
    Vic was a real sweetheart. He would go off for weeks at a time and then come back with all
     kinds of beforetime things. But he often had to travel to the Den to sell them. Not much call for
     that sort of stuff ‘round here.
  321: Where’s Vic now?
  322: Where’s the Den?
  323: Did Vic ever have anything that was labeled ‘Vault-Tek’?
  324: Tell me something else.
  325: I think that’s all I need to know.
  330: |-
    The Den is a hive of scum and villainy southeast of here. I guess about a week or so? Don’t
     remember too clearly. Anyhow, it’s an exciting place. Dangerous, but exciting. Sorry to leave there,
     in a way.
  331: Let me ask you something else.
  332: I think I’ll leave now, thanks.
  340: |-
    I don’t rightly know where Vic is. I know he has a house just down the street from us, to the
     east. He could be out trading with tribals or even in the Den, for all I know. I hope he’s okay. He was
     getting to be more than just a steady customer to me.
  341: I hope he’s okay, for your sake. Let me ask you another question.
  342: I hope he comes back to you. I think I’ll go now. Goodbye.
  350: Hello there, mister. My name's Jenny. Looking for a good scrub-down?
  351: Uh, no thanks; I was just looking around.
  352: Actually, I could use a bit of a rub (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).
  353: Well, actually, I just had a few questions that I wanted to ask you if you
    don’t mind.
  354: I’m looking for information about a trader of beforetime stuff.
  360: Hello there, miss. My name's Jenny. Can I help you?
  361: Uh, no; I just wanted to see what was in here. But I think I better go.
  362: Actually, I could pick up some personal beauty tips from a cutie like you.
  363: I just had a few questions that I wanted to ask you.
  364: I’m looking for information about a certain trader of beforetime stuff.
  370: |-
    Well then, you better talk to Big Nose Sally. She makes all the business arrangements for us
     and she doesn’t take kindly to any freelance work.
  380: |-
    Hello there, cute stuff. My name's Jenny. You looking for work here? If you move as good as you
     look, you could really make some good money here.
  381: I’m really not interested in a job here.
  382: Mmm, I’d love to show you, personally, just how good I can move.
  383: Thanks, but I think I just need to ask you some questions.
  384: I’m looking for information about a trader. He deals in beforetime things.
  390: |-
    Vault-tek? He might have had something like that. I’m not sure. I know he did have a lot of
     really old stuff.
  391: Thanks, Jenny. Let me ask you something else.
  392: Well I guess that’s all I need for now.
  400: |-
    A Geck? What’s that? Some kind of small gecko, I’d guess. Sorry, I don’t know what else it
     would be.
  401: Thanks, Jenny. Let me ask you something else.
  402: Well, I guess that’s all I need for now.
  500: "[Jenny slaps you] Please don't grope me like that!"
KCMAIDA:
  100: You see a plain looking, sturdily built young woman with a scowl on her face.
  101: You see Maida Buckner, Mrs. Buckner’s daughter
  102: |-
    You see a plain looking, sturdily built young woman. She’s looking back at you with a scowl on
     her face.
  200: |-
    You’ve really made me angry. I don’t want anything further to do with you. Now just get out.
     Tribals, humph! (mutter, mutter) ...shiftless, worthless, lazy...
  201: You are even more infuriating than Sulik! I don’t have time to talk to you.
    Go away.
  202: I don’t want to have anything to do with you either. Goodbye.
  203: |-
    I’m very sorry that I upset you. I’m just ignorant of your ways here. I was trying to show you
     respect in the manner of my tribe.
  204: |-
    Gosh, I’m really, really sorry. I’m just an ignorant tribal, after all. Can you possibly forgive
     me?
  205: |-
    I just didn’t know what to say to someone as attractive as yourself. I always get nervous when
     I’m near a beautiful woman. Please accept my apologies.
  206: |-
    It’s just that you seem so civilized and so beautiful. I was jealous of you. Please forgive me.
     I have so much to learn from women like you.
  210: Hello there, my name’s Maida Buckner. I help my mother run Buckner house. Can
    I help you?
  211: Ungh?
  212: 'Me '
  213: Unker Rouse?
  220: |-
    Hmm - seems as though your elevator doesn’t rise all the way to the top floor. Why don’t you
     talk to my brother, Torr? He’s a little closer to your speed. Goodbye.
  230: |-
    My name’s Maida Buckner; I take care of trading and drinks here. I don’t tolerate any tribals
     messing our family’s place up. So you just better watch your step here, or you’ll end up like Sulik.
     What do you want?
  231: My name’s Maida Buckner; I take care of trading and drinks here. What will
    it be for you, friend?
  232: Hello there, my good friend.
  233: What may I help you with?
  234: |-
    Well, you just better be more civil from now on. Just what do you want anyway? What can I help
     you with here?
  235: I have some questions for you.
  236: I was looking for someplace to stay.
  237: I need to buy some things.
  238: I’d like a drink.
  239: I guess I don’t need anything right now. Goodbye.
  240: |-
    Questions, huh? Well get on with it, then. Talking to you doesn’t get my work any closer to
     being finished.
  241: More questions? Well go on, then, and be quick about it.
  242: Have you ever heard of something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?
  243: Tell me about Sulik.
  244: Tell me about what’s going on here in Klamath.
  245: What other towns are nearby?
  246: I think that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye
  250: My mother takes care of the rooms. You should talk to her about that.
  251: Ok, thanks. There’s something else that I wanted to know, though.
  252: I’ll talk to her about that then. Goodbye.
  260: |-
    You want to barter? I’m always looking for good quality gecko pelts, and I pay a fair price
     for them, too.
  261: |-
    You want to buy something? I hope you have something other than gecko pelts to pay with; we’re
     overstocked on pelts right now.
  262: Yes, I’d like to trade with you.
  263: I’m more interested in something else at the moment.
  264: I guess I don’t need to trade right now. Goodbye.
  270: |-
    The only way I know to create a Garden of Eden is through plain old hard work. That's something
     you tribals just don’t seem to understand. But I guess that’s the difference between us civilized folk
     and yourselves.
  271: Uh, I guess. Tell me about something else then.
  272: Gee, I guess I have a lot to learn from you folks. I’d like to be civilized,
    too, someday.
  273: |-
    Civilized? You think you’re civilized because you live in the burnt-out ruins of a beforetime
     town? Tell me something else.
  274: I think I’ve heard just about enough. Goodbye.
  280: Well now, anything else that I can do for you?
  281: I’ve got enough gecko pelts to last me for a while. Anything else I can do
    for you?
  282: Actually, there was something else that I wanted to trade for.
  283: I was hoping for better prices. You sure aren’t cheap. Tell me about something
    else.
  284: You’re a tough bargainer, but fair. Tell me about something else.
  285: That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.
  290: |-
    There are only a couple of other towns nearby. There’s Redding far to the southwest, and the Den
     a few days south. But I wouldn’t go to the Den.
  291: Why wouldn’t you go to the Den?
  292: What about tribes in the area?
  293: Thanks for the advice. Tell me something else though.
  294: That’s all I need to know about for now. Goodbye.
  300: |-
    Well, I didn’t count tribes when you asked about civilized towns. But I guess there’s a group of
     savages somewhere to the northwest -- and then Sulik’s tribe, far to the southwest.
  301: |-
    That’s funny, my tribe doesn’t count pre-war towns when we talk about civilized places. Tell me
     something else.
  302: |-
    Oh, you’re civilized all right...and I don’t think I want any part of it. Tell me
     something else.
  303: Tell me about Sulik.
  304: What about the Den?
  305: Interesting. Let me ask you something else, though.
  310: |-
    The Den is a bad place to go. They even enslave ignorant tribals like yourself. It’s a week or
     so south of here, but most folks that’ve gone there don’t come back.
  311: Tell me about the local tribes.
  312: Isn’t Sulik your slave? Or do you just treat him like one?
  313: Interesting. Let me ask you something else, though.
  320: |-
    Sulik’s a tribal that’s working here to pay off a debt he foolishly incurred. He is not a
     slave. We don’t have slaves here in Klamath.
  321: Paying off a debt? What do you mean?
  330: |-
    Well, you see, Sulik got real upset one night and had too much booze. Then, when he was good
     and drunk, he busted up the place. He did nearly $500 worth of damage. Just now getting the place
     repaired.
  331: Why’d he get so upset?
  340: |-
    He said he found out that his sister had been kidnapped by slavers. But you’d have to ask him
     more about that. He’s here until he can pay off the rest of the damage he did while he was drunk.
  341: How much does he have to work off?
  350: |-
    He still has to pay off $350. If he weren’t so lazy and shiftless it would go quicker for him.
     He’s not leaving here until his debt is paid in full.
  351: That’s a lot of money. I think he’s going to be here for a long time.
  360: |-
    Well, he may be slow, but he does sort of grow on you after a while. (looks away wistfully)...
    (flustered) Now that’s enough jaw flapping; do you need anything else?
  361: I was curious about something else.
  362: What if someone else paid Sulik’s damages?
  363: That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.
  370: |-
    I don’t know why anyone would want to pay off his debt, but they could. His bill comes to $350.
     But you wouldn’t want to do that -- he’d only get into trouble again.
  371: I don’t like him having to stay here with a bigot like you. I want to pay for
    his damages.
  372: |-
    Well, I’m sure he must be happy working for you folks, but I still want to pay his damages. I
     don’t think anyone should be trapped the way he is.
  373: I guess you’re right. I don’t have that much money to spare, anyway. Goodbye.
  380: |-
    Well, okay then. If you really want to pay for the damage he caused...I guess all of you tribals
     really stick together.
  381: Yes, I do. I have enough to pay for the damages that he caused.
  382: Maybe that is too much money. I don’t think I want to pay for his damages after
    all. Goodbye.
  390: |-
    You must be crazy. I’ll sure be glad to have that damn (sob) tribal (sob) away (sob, sob) from
     here. (sob)
  391: |-
    (sob) I suppose that’s a fair trade, one idiot brother for one idiot (sob) savage. I won’t miss
     him a bit.
  392: |-
    Well, somehow, I think Sulik might actually miss being here. But we’ll be back to visit
     sometime, I’m sure. Right now, though, I need something.
  393: I think Sulik’s going to be a lot better off away from you.
  394: Thanks; I guess maybe I should be going now.
  400: |-
    You’re back, huh? I hope you’re taking care of Sulik. I’m sure he’s lost without me telling
     him what to do.
  401: I’m back because I need something.
  402: Well, I’m sure I can’t do as good a job of taking care of him as you did, but
    I’ll sure try.
  420: Well, you’d be better off asking momma about what’s going on right here in
    town.
  421: |-
    You’d be better off asking momma about things here in town. Have you seen Torr anywhere? It
     seems as though he’s run off, and we’re sure worried.
  422: OK, I’ll talk to Mrs. Buckner about that then. Let me ask you something else
    though.
  423: |-
    No, I haven’t seen Torr anywhere. I’ll let you know if I do. Let me ask you something else,
     though.
  430: Thanks for finding my brother, Torr. Ma and I were so worried.  What can I
    do for you?
  431: Thanks again for finding Torr. What can I do for you?
  432: I was happy to help Torr.
  433: Happy to find Torr, but I don’t think I need anything right now. Goodbye.
  434: |-
    Happy to help you out. Maybe you could do me a favor and free Sulik in return for my finding
     your brother?
  440: |-
    Have you seen my brother Torr anywhere? He lost some more brahmin and ma yelled at him. He must
     have run off after that.
  441: Uh-oh, where do you think he might have gone?
  442: I’m sorry to hear that, but I need information about something else.
  450: |-
    I don’t know where he went for certain, but I think that he might have run off to that canyon
     he was always talking about.
  451: A canyon? What canyon?
  460: |-
    Well there’s a canyon just east of where we graze the brahmin. Torr used to come up with wild
     stories about bugmen coming from there. He said that it was bugmen what mutilated our brahmin. Scared
     himself silly with those fool stories.
  461: Sounds as though it would scare just about anybody.
  470: |-
    I think he might have taken off to the canyon to prove his bravery or something. I sure hope
     someone can find him before he hurts himself.
  471: Maybe I should try to find him.
  472: I’m really sorry you can’t find him. I’m sure he’s fine. I need some information.
  473: Who knows where your idiot brother went to -- and who cares? I need some information.
  480: I’d be so grateful if you could find my brother for mom and me.
  481: I’d be happy to look for him.
  482: I’m sorry, but I don’t think I really have time for that right now. Goodbye.
  500: |-
    Thanks so much. I take back all those things I said about tribals. Please find my brother for
     me.
  501: I will; you can count on me.
  510: Have you found my brother yet? I sure hope he’s alright.
  520: You want a drink? That’ll be $5 for a glass of Buckner’s Best Brew.
  521: I’d love a nice beer. Fill ‘er up.
  522: 'I’d like to buy a round of drinks for everyone here by way of introducing
    myself. I’m '
  523: " from Arroyo."
  524: I don’t think I need a beer after all. Maybe just some information will do.
  530: A round for everyone. My, my - aren’t you a generous one? That’ll be $30.
  531: Have one on me, folks. Now, how about some information as well?
  532: I guess I’d rather just have a drink for myself after all.
  533: I think maybe I’ll just settle for some information for now.
  540: 'Looks as though you don’t have enough money for that. '
  541: Uh, well, I guess I’ll settle for some information then.
  542: Oh, maybe I’ll come back when I have more. Goodbye.
  550: |-
    I’ll sure be glad to have that damn (sob) tribal (sob) away (sob, sob) from
     here. (sob)

  101: You see Sajag, the owner and barman of the Golden Gecko.
  110: |-
    Hello there, stranger. Welcome to the Golden Gecko Tavern, Hotel, and Trading Post. I’m Sajag;
     I run the place. What can I get for you?
  111: Oh eh oh?
  112: Grink! (point at glass)
  113: I’ll have a drink.
  114: I’d like to buy a round of drinks for the whole bar, to introduce myself.
  115: I’d like to trade.
  116: I’d like a room for the night.
  120: Well, if it’s not another dang idiot. Just like Torr. Get the hell out of my
    bar.
  130: |-
    You’re our kind of people. You came to the right tavern to spend your money. What can I do for
     you, pal?
  131: |-
    You don’t seem to be too popular in this part of town. Well, maybe the jury’s still out on you.
     How can I help you?
  132: I need some beer.
  133: I would like to buy a round of drinks for everyone in the bar.
  134: I’d like to trade.
  135: I’d like a room for the night.
  136: Thanks for your help. Goodbye.
  137: Goodbye.
  140: One tall mug of Golden Gecko Piss coming up. Only $5 for the best beer north
    of Redding.
  141: You poured me a mug of piss!?!
  142: Thanks for the beer. I need some information though.
  143: Thanks. That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.
  150: A round of piss for the whole bar then! Huzzah! That’ll be $30. (Big smile)
  151: Everyone in here is drinking lizard piss!?!
  152: Hope everyone enjoys the beer. Sajag, I need some information.
  153: Enjoy your piss, everyone. Goodbye.
  160: |-
    Looks as though you don’t have enough money for that right now. Sorry, friend. No credit here.
     (smiles)
  161: |-
    Just like one of your kind to try and get something for nothing. No money, no service; now get
     out.
  170: Relax, pal; it’s just what we call the beer here. (chuckles) This is the Golden
    Gecko, remember?
  171: |-
    It’s just beer. Golden Gecko, Gecko Piss? Are you slow or what? (shakes his head) Tribals,
     sheesh.
  172: Oh. Heh, heh; well, back at Arroyo we actually...Uh, never mind.
  173: Oh, I get it. Well, aren’t you folks clever.
  174: I’m not drinking piss! I don’t care where it’s being served or what you call
    it!
  180: Well, now that we’ve got first things first out of the way...how can I help
    you? (smiles)
  181: Nice of you to drink with us lowlifes. (snickers) Just what do you want anyway?
  182: I think I’ll have another drink.
  183: I’d like to buy a round of drinks for all my new friends here.
  184: I have some questions for you.
  185: I think that’s all I need for now, thanks.
  190: Well information’s what it’s all about, pal. What do you want to know about?
  191: Yeah? What the heck do you want to know about?
  192: Are there any other settlements nearby?
  193: Are there any traders here in Klamath?
  194: Anything unusual going on here in Klamath?
  195: I’m looking for a job. Any leads?
  196: Where can I get healing supplies?
  197: |-
    I’m looking for something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Know where I might find such a
     thing?
  198: That’s all I need to know for now. But there’s something else I need.
  199: I guess, that’s enough info for now.
  210: |-
    Hey there, friend. A little bird told me that you know where old Whiskey Bob has his still. I
     sure would like to know where that is.
  211: You’re mistaken. I’ve never met anyone named Whiskey.
  212: I don’t think I want to tell you that.
  213: Why do you want to know where that is?
  214: I might know that. What’s it worth to you?
  215: Can’t stand a little competition, huh?
  220: Forget I mentioned it then. Not a big thing. (smiles)
  230: |-
    Well, Bob’s getting in the way of certain business partners. I don’t mind the competition.
     (grins) But they sure do. I’ll pay $50 to a smart cookie that can tell me where the still is. No other
     action required. (smiles)
  231: |-
    The story is that Bob’s homemade hootch is making people sick. I’ll pay $50 just to know where
     the still is, and then we can get the town council to shut him down. (smiles warmly)
  232: |-
    $50 is a good price -- especially when I don’t need to do anything myself to get it.
     (you give directions to the still)
  233: I don’t think I should tell you where the still is.
  234: I just don’t think Bob’s whiskey is making people sick.
  235: |-
    I’ll tell you where it is for $50. But, I want to hear more about your business partners.
     (you give directions to the still)
  240: |-
    Thanks for the information, friend. I’ll make sure it’s put to good use. (smiles) Here’s your
     $50 and a piss on the house, too. Anything else I can help you with?
  241: I think I’d like to have a nice piss to celebrate.
  242: How about a piss for all of my friends here?
  243: I have some questions that I’d like to ask you.
  244: That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.
  250: |-
    Well, let’s just say that I have connections with some important people south of here -- in the
     Den.
  251: Well, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the money.
  260: |-
    I’ve got all kinds of things right here, kid: healing supplies, booze, all kinds of stuff. I've
     got special sources, ya' might say. Always willing to look at a good gecko pelt, too.
  261: Let me see what you’ve got.
  262: I guess I don’t need anything right now. But I do have some questions.
  263: Special sources? Then you should be able to give me a really good price.
  270: |-
    Always plenty of rooms here for our friends. Only going to cost you $20 for eight hours of safe
     and comfortable shut-eye. A whole room to yourself. Have a party.
  271: We don’t have any rooms here, pal. Sorry, full up.
  272: "$20 sounds like a fair price to me. I’ll take it."
  273: I don’t think I’ll take you up on that offer just now, Sajag. What about something
    else?
  280: |-
    Hey pal, thanks for the information. My friends down in the Den aren’t worried about any
     competition anymore. (evil grin)
  281: |-
    Thanks for the information, friend. The town council, um, voted, to shut down Whiskey Bob’s
     still. He won’t be poisoning anyone else for a while. (sincere looking smile)
  282: I’m glad that I was able to help; of course, the $50 didn’t hurt, either.
  283: Well, I’m sure I’ll sleep easier knowing that Klamath is safe from Bob’s hooch.
  284: No skin off my back, pal.
  290: |-
    Well, let’s see. All sorts of things going on in town lately. (counts on his fingers) There’s
     brahmin-mutilating bugmen, rodents of unusual size, a walking spirit, and a missing hunter. Klamath’s
     become a real hot spot lately.
  291: Tell me about the brahmin-mutilating bugmen, please.
  292: Tell me about the RUS's, please.
  293: Tell me about the walking spirit, please.
  294: |-
    I’m not surprised that a hunter’s gone missing with all this excitement, but tell me about him,
     too.
  295: I’d like to ask about other things.
  296: I don’t want to know about anything else.
  300: |-
    Well, the Dunton brothers are always looking for someone to do their dirty work for them. And
     for that matter, Torr, the Buckner boy, is scared to go tend the brahmin at night on account of the
     bugmen.
  301: Thanks; I have another question for you.
  302: I guess that’s all I need to know. But I do need something else.
  303: That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.
  310: |-
    There are a couple of settlements nearby. There are some tribals northwest of us -— but I ‘spose
     you know about them. (smiles) Then there’s the Den a few days south of here -- that’s the closest --
     and there’s a mining town called Redding quite a ways to the southWest.
  320: |-
    Not too many traders in town. Just Vic, that I can think of. He’s got a house in the east
     part of town. He used to trade prewar stuff at the Den and to tribals. Haven’t seen him for a bit,
     though.
  330: |-
    Well, I don't have prices like this for just anybody. It's not easy to get this stuff from the
     Den.
  331: |-
    I’d like to make you one of my special friends, sweetheart. (grins) It’s not easy to get this
     stuff from the Den. Tell you what -— I’ll give you a special price on what I’ve got.
  340: I don’t know what you’re talking about, pal. Do you want to trade or not?
  341: Yeah, sure I want to trade. Sorry for asking.
  342: I guess I don’t want to trade with you after all.
  343: You’ve got connections to the Den. Come on - I know you can make me a better
    deal.
  350: |-
    Well, they say critters that look like man-sized bugs walking around on two legs are
     tearing open brahmin in the middle of the night. Only Torr’s caught a good look at them though. Scary,
     huh?
  360: |-
    Some say that there’s a gigantic rat, the size of a Corvega, that rules over all the rats over
     in Trapper Town (west of downtown). They say that it lives in an old mine underneath Trapper Town and
     that all the other rats bring it any shiny objects that they find. (licks his lips) Mmm, Shiny baubles.
  370: |-
    Well, west of town there’s a canyon. A few months back there was a bright light coming from there
     and then critters started disappearing. Tracks lead into the canyon, but none lead out. Spooky, huh?
     Some have heard a weird whining sound echoing off the canyon walls there, too.
  380: |-
    Well, Smiley was one of the best trappers there ever was. He up and left Mrs. Buckner one day,
     and said he was going to find where all the golden geckos come from. Said he’d be rich if he could
     find it. But he hasn’t come back -- and that was a while back, too.
  381: That’s incredible. Tell me more local news.
  382: That’s all I need to know for now.
  390: "Garden of Eden, huh? Well, Jenny’s the closest I’ve been to the Garden of
    Eden. Only a few\n dollars to create that. (smiles) Sounds nice, but I don’t know
    where you’d find it. "
  391: Well, that’s not quite what I was looking for. Let me ask you something else.
  392: That’s all I need to know for now.
KCSALLY:
  100: You see a plump, older woman with a large nose
  101: You see Big Nose Sally, the owner of the Bathhouse.
  200: Hello there, my name’s Sally Dunton. Hmm, did you catch that?
  201: Ally Onion? Gurk?
  202: I gotta pee-ee
  203: Oog? (shaking head)
  204: |-
    Well, that’s a right nice try for an idjit. But I ain’t having none of your kind in here. Now,
     git out. Shoo, shoo.
  205: |-
    I know you’re a tribal and all, but this is a bathhouse, not an outhouse. Git out afore I have
     you thrown out!
  206: |-
    I know my boys have taken up with some poor sorts, but you’re the worst yet. I just can’t
     believe that you let them down. I won’t have you in my place. Now, get out.
  210: |-
    My name’s Sally Dunton, but mostly they call me Big Nose Sally. I’m the owner of this here
     bathhouse. We have a whole hassleful of special, attended baths for you to pick from.
  211: What kind of special, attended baths do you have here?
  212: Gee, Miss Sally, I just wanted a regular bath. You don’t have a bubble bath,
    do you?
  213: I think I’ve changed my mind; I may try back later.
  220: |-
    My name’s ‘Big Nose’ Sally Dunton and I’m the owner of this here bathhouse. I’m afraid that we just
     have girl bath attendants here. That alright with you?
  221: I’m just here for a bath.
  222: Women suit me just fine.
  223: Gee, I was really looking for a male attendant.
  224: I don’t think this is what I was looking for.
  225: I’m sorry that we couldn’t help you out. Come on back later, though.
  230: |-
    If you just want an unattended bath, you might try the Golden Gecko or the Buckner House. But I
     doubt that you’ll find that as enjoyable.
  231: Thanks, Miss Big Nose. I’ll try that instead. Good-bye.
  232: I was just kidding; I’d like a special bath.
  240: |-
    The special baths that we have available vary in cost by the amount of time that the gal spends
     with you, and any special services that you take advantage of.
  241: You mean I get to be with a real-live girl? Sign me up!
  242: I don’t think I’m ready for this; I better go.
  243: I think that the appearance of the attendant better figure into the cost, too.
  250: |-
    The baths that we have available are: a Wash Cloth Hand Wipe, a brief Full Body Wash, and,
     lastly, the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Servicing, offered by the beautiful and talented Jenny,
     recently trained at the finest house in the Den.
  251: I think I can get by with the Hand Wipe; how much is that?
  252: I like the idea of a Full Body Wash; what’s that going to cost?
  253: Beautiful and talented? I’ve got to hear more about the Round-the-World Full
    Squeaky Clean Wash.
  254: I don’t think I’m ready to take a bath with someone else watching; I’m going
    to leave.
  255: Can I mix and match the different types of baths?
  256: What about getting a discount on those baths?
  260: |-
    No, you have to choose one at a time, but you can always come back for more -- usually
     after a brief rest.
  261: Tell me the different types of bath again.
  262: If I can’t make my own combinations, I don’t even want a bath; I’m outta here.
  270: Well, for an attractive individual like yourself that would only cost $25.
  271: "$25? That’s a bargain; I’ll take it."
  272: Hmm, tell me about the other types of baths again.
  273: Maybe I don’t need this right now. I’m leaving.
  280: Hmm, you look as though you need a real bath first; that’ll make the price
    $35.
  281: "$35? That seems kind of steep -- but I guess I am a bit scruffy. I’ll take
    it."
  282: What are the other choices again?
  283: Thanks, but I think I’ll look elsewhere.
  284: "$35 seems kind of expensive; got any cute brahmin, instead?"
  290: |-
    I think any of our girls would be happy to give you a full body wash; I just better watch the
     time to make sure it’s a brief one (chuckle). The Brief Full Body Wash will cost you $55.
  291: That sounds like fun. Here’s my $55.
  292: Hmm, what are the other choices again?
  293: Thanks, but I think that I’ll save my money for now.
  300: |-
    You could use a bit of real scrubbing; don’t you tribals know about soap? Oh well, that’ll cost
     you $70 for the Brief Full Body Wash...but I’m sure that you’ll be happy with the results.
  301: Wow, $70! That seems like a lot. But I bet it’s worth it. I’ll try it.
  302: What were the other bathing options?
  303: I don’t think that I want to pay for a bath after all.
  310: |-
    Well I’m sure that your Round-the–World trip Servicing with beautiful Jenny will be an
     experience that you’ll savor for quite a while. A real bargain at only $125.
  311: I can’t wait to enjoy Jenny’s special talents. Here’s my $125.
  312: Maybe I should hear about the other bath choices again.
  313: |-
    I don’t think that I’ll ever need $125 worth of cleaning. I’m going to leave before I get
     myself into trouble.
  320: |-
    Hmm, I don’t know if Jenny will even take you in the condition that you’re in. You’re going to
     need a thorough, no-nonsense, scrubbing first. (To herself: I wonder if Gerda is free for that?) With
     the cost of the pre-scrubbing, the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Servicing is yours for only $185.
  321: I get both Gerda and Jenny? What a bargain! Here’s my $185.
  322: Is Gerda that larger, mustachioed woman? I better hear the other choices again.
  323: I don’t think that I can afford this right now. I think I’m going to leave.
  324: |-
    Gerda isn’t really a woman at all, is she? I don’t want to be scrubbed down by a burly
     drag-queen. I’m outta here.
  330: That’s a great choice, if you don’t have a lot of time or money.
  340: 'I think you’ll really enjoy this. '
  350: I think that you’ll enjoy Jenny bathing you more than any bath you’ve ever
    had.
  360: |-
    We don’t handle that sort of thing here. Try talking to my sons, Chuck and Buck Dunton. I
     understand that their brahmin are pretty darn popular with a certain set.
  361: You don’t have enough money. Come back when you’re able to pay.
  362: |-
    It seems as though your eyes are bigger than your budget. Perhaps you’d like to try a cheaper
     washing.
  363: |-
    I’m certain that one of my sons would be happy to help you out. But you might want to come back
     here afterwards; most gals that spend any time with my boys get a hankerin’ to bathe themselves real
     good.
  370: Back again, huh? A lot of folks just can’t seem to get clean enough.
  371: I’m just looking around this time; I don’t need a bath.
  372: Tell me the types of bath that you have again.
  373: Do I get a return customer discount?
  380: |-
    Well now, it wouldn’t be fair to discount any of our services. My gals are well worth what they
     charge.
  381: Well, if I can’t get a discount, I’m leaving.
  382: I guess that’s fair enough. Tell me what baths you have available.
  390: |-
    Before we go any further, you’ve gotta know that the baths are for individuals, not groups. You
     can make your own arrangements, and then your friends can do as they please on their own.
  391: Ok.
  400: We don't want your kind around here.
KCSLIM:
  100: You see a very tall and lanky trapper.
  101: You see Slim Picket, the head of Trapper Town.
  110: |-
    Well, mister, you sure don’t look chewed up by those rats yet -- but you will if you keep
     pestering them. Just don’t bring any back here with you.
  111: |-
    Well, little missy, you sure don’t look chewed up by those rats yet -- but you will if you keep
     pestering them. Just don’t bring any back here with you.
  112: Don’t worry. I won’t.
  113: No, thanks to you.
  114: Uh, ok.
  120: |-
    I just don’t want to have anything to do with those critters. I leave ‘em alone and hope they’ll
     do the same for me. Take care now.
  130: Just be careful. Seems the deeper you go, the bigger they get back there.
  140: |-
    Hello, tribal. My name’s Slim Picket and you can talk to me about Trapper Town. We don’t want
     any trouble here.
  141: |-
    Hello there, friend. Nice of you to visit all of us here. My name’s Slim Picket. I talk for
     Trapper Town.
  142: 'Hello there Slim. My name’s '
  143: ". Why do you call this Trapper Town?"
  144: Do you know where I could find something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?
  145: Nice to meet you, Mr. Picket. I’m just looking around for now, though. Goodbye.
  150: 'Hello there, my name’s Slim Picket. I speak for this part of town. '
  151: Gruk.
  152: Ook, oople.
  153: "(point at self) Me "
  154: ", me hungry"
  160: |-
    Say, your antenna don't pick up all the channels do it? Well, I tell you what. Here's
     a key to that door behind me. There's all kinds of rats back there - even one big
     one s'posedly. You go through there and kill all the dang rats you can eat. How's that?
  161: |-
    That big ol' rat that was bothering everyone hereabouts seems to have disappeared. But
     I don't reckon that an idjit like you had anything to do with it.
  162: OK. Heh, heh, rat kill. Heh, heh, heh.
  163: No! Rats scaaarrrry! No. Me go now.
  170: What the heck do you want this time?
  171: Hi there. How can I help you out?
  172: I think I need a key to get into the north part of Trapper Town.
  173: I’ve got some questions that I wanted to ask you.
  174: I guess I don’t need anything. Goodbye.
  180: |-
    Well, this here part of town is where all of us trappers live when we’re not out trapping
     geckos. Only problem about the free digs are the rats on the north side. But we have most of the
     entrances to that part of the mall barricaded pretty good.
  181: What did you want to know about?
  182: Do you ever go to the north side?
  183: Tell me about trapping geckos.
  184: Do you know anything about a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?
  185: You sure have a lot of cars here.
  186: Rats? Tell me more about rats.
  187: Thanks for the info. I don’t think I need to know about anything else. Goodbye.
  190: |-
    Oh, you mean a GECK. huh? Well, I saw an ad for one of those in an old magazine. But I don’t
     think they exist anymore. Certainly not around here, anyplace.
  191: Really? Well, tell me about something else then.
  192: Oh, well; that’s all I wanted to know. Thanks.
  200: You want the key to the north side of Trapper Town? What do you want that for?
  201: You still want that key? Why?
  202: |-
    I’m an explorer; I want to explore everyplace I can. Besides, maybe there’s a GECK forgotten
     on a back shelf in there.
  203: I’m going to help you with your rat problem.
  204: I just want to try to get to that car on the other side of the fence.
  205: |-
    I’d be willing to give anything to get that key. I really want to get to the other side of
     Trapper Town.
  206: I guess I wouldn’t want a key. It sounds as though it’s pretty dangerous over
    there.
  210: |-
    Well, OK, here’s the key. Just don’t go stirring up too much trouble back there, and make sure
     you close the door behind you.
  211: |-
    What a hoot! I sure needed that, sweetheart. You just make sure that nothing happens to that
     pretty little tail of yours, now. (heh, hee, hee)
  212: Thanks for the key, Slim. Before I go, I have some questions for you.
  213: Thanks, Slim. I’ll make sure the door’s closed behind me. Goodbye.
  220: If you want the key, you’re going to have to buy it from me.
  221: I don’t mind trading for the key.
  222: |-
    I don’t want to trade for the key. It won’t cost you anything to let me borrow it. I’ll make
     sure to close the door after myself.
  223: If you let me have the key, I’m sure that you’ll have fewer rats to worry about
    after I use it.
  224: I don’t think I want the key. Goodbye.
  230: I guess you got what you wanted. Just be careful now.
  231: Thanks.
  232: You drive a hard bargain. I hope it was worth it.
  240: |-
    Well, I guess you didn’t need that key as much as you thought, huh? You sure you got what you
     wanted?
  241: Oops; I knew there was something else I wanted.
  242: Hey, Slim, I have a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about.
  243: I don’t need anything else from you. Thanks anyhow.
  250: |-
    We blocked off all the entrances to the north side of town except one. I have a key to that one
     entrance -- just in case anyone needs to get over there for any reason. I can’t figure out why anyone
     would want to, though; I sure wouldn’t.
  251: Interesting; tell me something else.
  252: I’m interested in getting that key from you.
  253: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  260: You’re interested in trapping, huh? (He looks you up and down.)
  261: "[MORE]"
  270: |-
    I don’t think I’d try it if I were you. You might get your hands all dirty and callused.
     (heh, hee, hee) Anything else you want to know about?
  271: Well, I sure wouldn’t want to get my hands dirty. Tell me something else.
  272: I sure wish I was as skillful a trapper as you are. I bet you could teach me
    a lot.
  273: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  280: |-
    Well, now you look like you could handle yourself. Geckos come in two types -— regular or
     golden. The regular ones are easy to trap and hunt, but the golden ones are worth more money.
  281: Tell me more about the golden geckos.
  282: Interesting. Tell me something else.
  283: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  290: "The golden ones are sneaky and twice as vicious as the regular ones. Plus,
    once they bite you\n they’ll hold on and gnaw through to the bone. And that’s
    not even counting their poison. But their\n hides look real nice, and so they’re
    worth a lot more. "
  291: Tell me more.
  300: |-
    One real good trapper, name of Smiley, went north looking for wherever they come from. He was
     convinced that they all came from one place. Thing is, nobody’s heard from him for a couple months now.
  301: What do you think happened to him?
  310: |-
    Maybe he found where they come from and got all ate up. (heh, hee, hee) But I tell you one
     thing; Mrs. Buckner’s heart just about broke when he didn’t come back. You see, he was her beau. Mrs.
     Buckner runs Buckner house, y’know.
  311: Interesting. Tell me something else.
  312: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  320: |-
    We have a whole lot full of cars. All ready for their owners to come back from shopping. Thing
     is, they never did. Not a dang one of ‘em runs, though. There’s a real beauty of a Chrysalis Motors
     Highwayman just east of here, but I haven’t figured out how to get to it, yet.
  321: A Highwayman? Interesting. Tell me about something else.
  322: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  330: |-
    Well, they taste pretty good if you spit-roast ‘em with just a titch of herbs. But most of the
     time they can be a real nuisance, and they’re getting worse. We’ve barricaded the north part of the
     mall -- well, Trapper Town, that is -- but they’re sneaking through anyway. There’s one door right here
     behind my room, but I have it locked.
  331: |-
    At home, mom just used to pan-fry them with a little butter. But, tell me more about the rat
     attacks.
  332: Interesting. Tell me about something else.
  333: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  335: |-
    Well they taste pretty good if you spit-roast 'em with just a titch of herbs. But most
     of the time they can be a real nuisance, and they're getting worse. We've barricaded
     the north side of town but they're sneaking through anyway. There's one door to the north side, right here, but
     I have it locked.
  336: |-
    Well, there used to be a real bad rat problem hereabouts, but lately, there jist ain't so
     many rats about. It's like they all got skeered and bugged outa here.
  337: |-
    At home mom just used to pan-fry them with a little butter. But, tell me more about
     the rat attacks.
  340: |-
    People been disappearing. Just them as are slow and sickly, for now. 'Course, they
     don't stop to cook their food like us. They just gnaw it into a few bloody clumps of hair and
     rags. Least that's all we find in the morning. I've even heard talk that there's some kind of
     giant rat god that tells 'em all what to do.
  341: |-
    Interesting. Maybe someone should do something about that. Say, do you have a key to
     the north side of Trapper Town?
  342: Interesting. Tell me about something else.
  343: That’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  350: |-
    Well, you ain’t that pretty, but it’s sure been a long time. I guess I could give you the key
     as long as you give me what I need. (heh, hee, hee)
  351: |-
    Well, you sure are a pretty li’l thing, ain’t you? I’m sure we can get you that key you want.
     You just have to give me something I want. (heh, hee, hee)
  352: OK, but I just hope they call you Slim because of your height.
  353: Uh, that’s not exactly what I had in mind.
  354: Wipe that leer off your face. I think I just better leave before you get hurt.
    Goodbye.
  360: I could teach you something about the outdoors. But it’s going to cost you
    $100.
  361: I’m always happy to share my skill with others. I can teach you some tricks
    for only $50.
  362: Well, you better have a lot to teach me for that.
  363: That’s a lot of money. Just tell me what you know about other things.
  364: I don’t think I need to learn anything right now. Goodbye.
  370: Your tribe are mostly farmers aren’t they? I don’t think I could teach you
    a darn thing.
  371: I’m that good already, huh? Well, tell me about something else then.
  372: I think I’ll be going then. Goodbye.
  380: |-
    Well, that ought to have learned you a thing or three about the great out-of-doors. Hope you
     can put it to good use. Remember about the scat now.
  381: |-
    You’re right. Old scat doesn’t taste near the same as fresh. Thanks, Slim. Now tell me more
     about those geckos.
  382: |-
    Thank you for all the tips, Slim, but I still think just smelling the scat is good enough. I
     was wondering about something else, though.
  383: Thanks for the information, Slim. I’m going to go and practice right now. Goodbye.
  390: Tell me about those rats.
  400: You shore took the fight outta them rats.
  401: Hello there. Nice to live in a rat-free envi-ro-ment.
  402: Yup. Fewer rats 'an ever now.
  403: Wonder what happened to the rats?
  404: Good riddance to rodent rubbish.
  405: You're jist a regular Pied Piper, ain't cha? Thankee.

    You see a filthy trapper with torn and bloodstained clothing. He appears to be favoring one leg
     slightly.
  101: You see Smiley, the trapper. He’s limping a bit and looks unhappy.
  102: You see Smiley, the trapper. He looks a lot better since you rescued him from
    the caves.
  103: |-
    You see a middle-aged man wearing the bloody and torn clothes of a trapper. He doesn’t look
     very well.
  104: |-
    You see Smiley, the trapper. He looks as though his health has improved greatly since you
     rescued him from the cave.
  110: |-
    Hello there, stranger. People call me Smiley. I’m sure glad to see you. I thought I was going
     to die here for certain! I'm hurt too bad to get past those damn lizards on my own.
  111: Smiley, heh, heh, heh. Ook.
  112: What are you doing here?
  113: Nice to meet you, Smiley. I think I’ll be going now.
  120: |-
    Great. Another Torr. I (points at himself) need you (points at you) to help me get out of here
     (makes walking fingers motion on hand).
  121: 'Go? Now? Ook '
  122: " go. Bad lizards! Bad!"
  130: Yes! That’s it. We go (walking fingers again) together (clasps hands together).
    Right now!
  131: 'Smiley go with '
  132: " now."
  133: 'Smiley no go with '
  134: ". No like Smiley. Goodbye."
  140: Hey! Wait! You can’t just leave me here.
  141: Oh, sorry. What was I thinking?
  142: Well, I guess not.
  143: I can and I will. I think I’m going to do just that. Goodbye.
  150: |-
    I always caught more golden geckos north and west of Klamath than anywheres else. So I figured
     that all the golden geckos lived someplace up here.
  151: Looks like you were right.
  160: I’d love to chat with you, but let’s just get out of here now and chat later.
    Okay?
  161: Uh, yeah. I guess that’s a good idea.
  162: Just one question, first. What do you know about these caves?
  170: |-
    Looks as though I was a little too right. I got in here okay, but then one of those damn geckos
     got behind me and damn near took my leg off. I just barely made it over here.
  171: I wonder why they didn’t finish you off?
  180: |-
    Well, I guess they don’t like to crawl through the goo too much. I can’t say as I blame them.
     It sure burns if gets on your skin. But that doesn’t seem to stop ‘em from licking up the darn stuff
     like it was Buckner’s Best.
  181: Interesting.
  190: |-
    Enough gum flapping. Now let’s get out of here. I figure that if I can join you we should both
     be able to make it out of here okay. I sure could use the help.
  191: |-
    Ok. You can join me. I’ll make sure you get out of here and back to Klamath. I think that Ardin
     is going to be glad to see you again.
  192: Well, OK. But I don’t want you whining for help all the time.
  200: |-
    These caves look like a prewar storage area. I think there must be more down below us but
     there’s some kind of fancy teck-no-logical lock on the door. Anyhow, I’ve had enough. Let’s git out of
     here.
  201: OK.
  210: |-
    Whew. I think I just used up some lives that time around. Why don’t you come over to the
     Buckner place a little later on, and I’ll make sure you get a nice reward for saving me.
  211: Thanks, Smiley. I was happy to do it. Goodbye.
  212: OK, whatever. Goodbye.
  213: About time you mentioned a reward. It better be a good one. Goodbye.
  220: Well, if’n it ain’t my idjit friend. Thanks a heap. Goodbye to you.
  221: |-
    Hello there, friend. Thanks again for getting me out of that tight spot. Anything I can help you
     with?
  222: Anything else, friend?
  223: Well, I had a few questions about hunting geckos.
  224: I have all sorts of questions about this area.
  225: Is Mrs. Buckner happy to see you back?
  226: No, I guess I just wanted to say hello. Talk to you later, Smiley. Goodbye.
  230: I sure owe you for saving my hide. Least I can do is to teach you something
    in return.
  231: Teach?
  232: Thanks Smiley. I'd sure appreciate any tips you could give me.
  240: |-
    Since those geckos nearly had my hide let me teach you how to get theirs. Here's how you skin 'em. (Smiley
     demonstrates) ...and when you kill 'em you can get their hides an' sell 'em. OK?
  241: Urk. Pretty, heh, heh, heh. Sell. Heh, heh, heh. Bye.
  242: Thanks, I'm sure that will come in handy. Tell me something else though.
  243: Thanks for showing me how to do that, Smiley. I think I'll go practice on some
    geckos. Goodbye.
  250: 'I think you know enough about geckos now. '
  251: |-
    Heh, heh. I think maybe you could teach me something about geckos. I don’t think I can help you
     out with that.
  252: |-
    Well, I guess I know more about geckos than anyone alive. I was raised on gecko milk, you know.
     But it’ll take a few hours.
  253: I want to know all you can teach me about geckos.
  254: I guess I don’t need to know about that right now. Tell me something else though.
  255: Gecko milk? I thought geckos were reptiles.
  260: There’s more you need to know than you even know you need.
  261: Teach me, oh great trapper.
  262: Uh, yes. Go ahead. I’m listening.
  263: Well, okay. Spin your tall tales. I’ll listen.
  264: Maybe I don’t need to know about this. Goodbye.
  270: |-
    Well, you see it’s like this - golden geckos and regular geckos are basically the same critter
     except the golden’s got a big second helping of sheer cussedness... (time passes as you learn the lore
     of the Gecko)
  271: That was great. I think I know a lot more about geckos now. Thanks. Goodbye.
  280: Maida Buckner, Widow Buckner’s daughter, is the one to talk to about all sorts
    of town gossip.
  281: Let me ask you something else, then.
  282: Oh, I see. Thanks. Goodbye.
  290: |-
    Widow Buckner’s so darn happy to have me back that she may be Mrs. Smiley before too long. She
     was even talking about giving you a little something for finding my hairy butt and returning it to her.
  291: I’m happy for the two of you. Let me ask you something else.
  292: That’s great. I’ll have to talk to her. Goodbye.
  300: Hey, thanks for saving my sorry ass. I better high-tail it back to Klamath.
    See you there.
  310: Don't worry about me. I can make it back from here on my own.
  320: 'You gain '
  330: exp. points for rescuing Smiley.

     attacks by bipedal, carapaced creatures that I call bugmen.)

     more about that.)

  160: |-
    Bugmen take moo-moos at night. Torr scared! Hep Torr? (Well, as I said, they are nocturnal in
     their feeding habits. I sure could use some assistance in guarding the grahmin. Will you kill any
     bugmen that you see near the brahmin?)
  161: Bugmen take moo-moos at night. Torr scared! Hep Torr?
  162: |-
    Hep Torr hep moo-moo. (Yes, of course I’ll help you fend of the predation of your family’s
     brahmin by these nefarious bugmen.)

  165: I can’t (shaking head at Torr) help you with that. Goodbye.

    here in town?)

    you, as well.)

    I’ll help you guard the Brahmin tonight, Torr. See you in the pasture east of town, right around
     sunset. Goodbye.

     tribal, that my mom is making work off a debt -— I think sis is in love with him. Mom’s boyfriend,
     a fellow named Smiley, is missing someplace out to the west. Quite exciting here, lately.)

     things. He lives in the northeast part of Klamath.)

  700: |-
    Tragu? Oo Kramat? Ick boo Den. (A trader here in Klamath? Why yes, Vic trades in
     antiquities for the most part. He's not in town right now. I think he might be trading
     things at the Den. That's south of here.)
  701: Groo! (Thanks so much, Torr. Now what were you saying about your predators?)
  702: |-
    Grok! Torr! (Thanks so much, Torr. You're a prince amongst men. I need to be
     leaving but I wish you the best of luck with your cattle production. Goodbye, friend Torr.)
  800: You have succesfully rescued Torr.
KLAMALL:

KLATRAP:

ModMain:
  100: A small, quaint farming community, surrounded by vast fields of dead or dying
    crops.
  500: Looks like I killed them all.
  600: You see a coin bag.
  601: You see a coin bag. Someone probably tossed it into the well to make a wish.
  610: This is MY dream, MY wish, and I'm taking it back. I'm taking them all back.
  1000: Kill them all!
  1001: Death to the Slags!
  1002: I wanna watch 'em scream!
  1003: Let's go get 'em!
  1100: |-
    You fall some 15 feet into a dimly lit cave. Various farming equipment lays neatly
     stored against the far wall.
  1200: |-
    You made it out of the hole just in time for the explosion to go off behind you,
     sending you flying through the air.
ModShit:
  100: |-
    There is an overwhelming smell of methane gas down here. One tiny spark would blow this hole
     sky high.
NewRVB:
  100: You have arrived on a desert plain outside of New Reno.
  110: You see several crates filled with chemicals.
  120: |-
    You see several crates filled with chemicals. You can't identify the chemicals,
     but they have been packed VERY carefully.
  130: You see a Vertibird.
  140: |-
    You see a Vertibird... an advanced form of helicopter. Unfortunately, you have no
     idea how to operate it.
  150: You have no idea how to operate it.
  200: "(These guys give me the creeps...)"
  201: "(Shut up. Here they come.)"
  202: "*Zztttt* Do you have the cargo we requested? *Zzzttt*"
  203: Yes, the chemicals are all here. You can check them if you like.
  204: "*Zztttt* That will not be necessary. *Zzzttt*"
  205: |-
    *Zztttt* You know what will happen if the chemicals do not meet the specifications
     we requested. *Zzzttt*
  206: Right, of course. Uh, and you brought the lightbringers...?
  207: "*Zztttt* The laser weapons are in our cargo bay. *Zzzttt**"
  208: |-
    *Zztttt* To insure your cooperation, we will transmit the arming sequence for them
     once the chemicals are loaded. *Zzzttt*
  209: Uh...well...all right then. Load her up, boys --
  210: "*Zztttt* No. *Zzzttt*"
  211: "*Zztttt* We will load the cargo. *Zzzttt*"
  212: Uh, right...right. Of course. Give them room, boys.
  213: All right; we're good here. The rest of you guards head back to Reno. We'll
    meet up with you.
  250: Look! Someone's been watching us!
  251: Kill them!
  252: Looks like we got us a spy...!
  253: "*Zztttt* Mission aborted. Cargo failsafe sequence engaged. *Zzzttt*"
  254: "*Zztttt* Terminate hostiles, then return to base. *Zzzttt*"
  300: Don't get near those armored fellas. They'll carve you up.
  301: Get back in position.
  302: Stop twitching...those armored guys don't like it much.
  350: Dammit! What are you doing, dipshit?!
  351: Get back to your post! What the hell are you do --?!
  352: "*Zztttt* Mission aborted. Cargo failsafe sequence engaged. *Zzzttt*"

  401: Yup
  402: Wander off
  403: Board the Vertibird.
  404: Leave it alone.
  450: "[The door seals behind you, and the Vertibird takes off! You can't open the
    door!]"
  451: Uh-oh
  452: Oh, shit...
  500: |-
    These crates are filled with heavy metal canisters. Judging from the care packing
     them, you suspect that they contain some sort of hazardous chemicals.
  550: Now's probably not the best time to be striking up conversation.

  107: The Project is proceeding well.
  108: It's a shame about Vice-President Bird.

  129: I think I need a breathe of fresh air.
  130: Is it getting darker in here?
  131: So sleepy, must rest.

  133: Another drill?
  134: I thought I heard gunfire.
  135: Hey, who're you?
  136: Halt! Who goes there?
  137: I get so tired of these drills all the time.
  138: Yeah, like I'd recognize an intruder.
  139: Don't worry about it.
  140: The troopers will take care of us.
  141: Where's a trooper when you need one?
  142: I just need to stay calm - stay calm.
  143: I'll never finish this.
  144: I'd sure rather be somewhere else.
  145: That terminal operator was kind of cute.
  146: This doesn't make sense.
  147: I'm underpaid for this.
  148: I'm doing everyone else's work.
  149: Why don't people do what they're supposed to?
  150: Just hit a terminal if it doesn't work-fixes 'em every time.
  151: This pong game is cool. Hope nobody catches me.
  152: I need some caffeine.
QCGENGRD:
  100: You see a person in powered armor.

  123: I love my work.
  124: Did you hear something?
  125: My feet are *killing* me.
  126: So, did you hear the one about the new second louie?
  127: Nothing ever happens here anyway.

  149: Where are the spirits when you need them?
  150: Help us!
  151: Free us!
  152: I want to go home.
  153: First drought and now this.
  154: No more needles, no more!
  155: I can't take it! The walls are closing in on me!
  156: "(Sob, sob)"
  157: Let my people go!
  158: Elder guide us.
  159: How did we offend these evil spirits?
  160: I don't much care for this.
  161: Where's Martin?
  162: This isn't a vault at all.
  163: Get us out of here!
  164: Hello? Hello!
  165: I insist upon being freed.
  166: I'm a United States citizen and I demand to see who's in charge.
  167: Let me out.
  168: This is so boring.
  169: No more medicine. I can't take it anymore.

  104: This is crap!
  105: This data's consistent.
  106: These points give a good curve.
  107: What's the standard deviation?
  108: I'm waiting for these compounds to equilibrate.
  109: This spectrometer is fucked up.
  110: Where's the maintenance crew when you need them?
  111: I just calibrated the IR-spectrometer.
  112: How did the recrystalization go?

  114: Excellent work.
  115: The Project is going according to plan.
  116: Excellent results here.
  117: What now?
  118: Radiation is really going to screw up my work.
  119: Just another drill.
  120: I can't leave my work now.
  121: I'll never make it to a shelter.
  122: I feel a little queasy.
  123: How do they expect me to work with no power?
  124: This is really going to fuck up my experiment.
  125: This is too much.
  126: They really ought to warn us when they're going to test the emergency systems.
  127: My lungs are burning.
  128: I can't see! Who turned out the lights?
  129: "(Cough, hack, cough)"
  130: "(Splutter, cough)"
  131: My throat's bleeding!
  132: My eyes are on fire!

  135: Ohhhh nooooooo.
  136: I can see the light…I'm coming mother.
  137: I don't see anyone.
  138: Must be another security drill.
  139: Don't those troopers ever get tired of these drills?
  140: Not again - that's the second time this month.
  141: I've had it up to here with those jar-heads.
  142: They just *have* to feel important.
  143: What a waste of time.
  144: As though there'd be an intruder here.
  145: Yeah, where'd an intruder come from anyway?
  146: Like we wouldn't see an intruder approaching.
  147: Another alarm malfunction. Great.
  148: I don't have time for this shit.
  149: What do you want?
  150: Can't you see I'm working here?
  151: Go away. I'm busy.
  152: Don't you have anything better to do?

  106: Uh, doggies? Okay, whatever. Let's go.
  107: |-
    Hello. I'm Enrico Savinelli. I run the caravan between New Reno and Redding. We can use an
     extra guard, if you're willing to leave right now.
  108: |-
    Hello. I'm Savinelli. I run the caravan between New Reno and Redding. Always looking for a
     reliable guard or two. We leave town on the 21st of every month. If you want to go with us, make sure
     you're here on the 21st.
  109: What d'ya want?
  110: Moo-moos?
  111: You need a guard, huh?
  112: What do you trade?
  113: Why are you waiting until the 21st?
  114: I don't think that's for me. Goodbye.
  115: They sure picked the wrong caravan to mess with.
  116: Fuck with my caravan, will they?
  117: Motherfuckers should know better than to try that with my caravan.
  118: Well, they're sleeping with the fishes now. Let's move out.
  119: More of those shit-heels all the time.
  120: You abandon my caravan, and then come back to beg for work? Get out of here.
  121: I said get out. Are you deaf as well as yellow?
  122: |-
    I respect thieves...but only good ones. You're nothing but a punk. Get out of here before I
     have to hurt you.
  123: A thief? I resemble that remark, you damn ingrate. I'm leaving. Goodbye.
  200: Bring it on!
  124: You'll regret crossing me. Goodbye.
  125: |-
    That was one of the worst caravans I've had in years. I'm not making money on it, so guess
     what? Neither are you. Get out of my sight.
  126: Yeah? I'd like to see you try that, you cheap bastard. Goodbye.
  127: Well, sometimes you just get luckier than others. This was one of the unlucky
    times. Goodbye.
  128: |-
    Fuck. My ass is really in a sling here. We lost so much stuff this run. I knew I shoulda'
     hired pros. Here's $500 for your time, you worthless sack of shit.
  129: Well, something is better than nothing, I guess. Goodbye.
  130: You lousy bastard! Nobody could have done a better job. Goodbye.
  131: That's the ticket. That run went smooth as shit through a goose. Here's your
    $1500, pal.
  132: I don't think I ever want to spend so much time looking at the ass-end of a
    brahmin again. Goodbye.
  133: Thanks. See you later. Goodbye.
  134: |-
    That's the way a caravan run should go. Smooth as a baby's silky bottom. Here's your $1500, and
     I'll even throw in an extra $200 for the smooth service.
  135: Nice to find someone who appreciates quality when he sees it. See you around,
    maybe. Goodbye.
  136: Thanks for the extra change, Savinelli. Goodbye.
  137: |-
    I'm not sure how long it's going to take these damn dirt-grubbers to get my gold shipment
     together. We'll be ready to go on the 21st, no matter what. Check back with me if you still want a job.
  138: |-
    Hey, I'm putting together a shipment of some delicate stuff. Stuff that takes time. Can't rush
     quality, ya' know. Should be ready to go on the 21st. Come back then if you still want a job.
  139: What do you usually transport?
  140: Let me ask you something else.
  141: Thanks, I'll do that. Goodbye.
  142: |-
    We're usually looking for caravan guards, but I ain't ready to go just yet. I'll be ready to
     head out on the 21st. Come back then if you want a job.
  143: When on the 21st?
  144: What does this caravan transport?
  145: OK, thanks. Goodbye.
  146: Hey, pal, you've gotta know when to say no. And *I* do. So NO!
  147: Oh, okay.
  148: |-
    Well, we pick up mostly, uh, medical supplies - yeah, that's it - in New Reno, and trade it to
     Redding for gold ore.
  149: That's interesting. You said you're looking for guards?
  150: Let me ask you something else.
  151: Oh, okay. Goodbye.
  153: You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $1500.
    Ready to join us?
  152: |-
    You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $1500, but I'm only paying
     you for the job since I only need one more guard. Ready to join us?
  154: Sounds great. I'm ready. Let's go.
  155: I don't think I want to be a caravan guard. I'll see you around. Goodbye.
  156: You were an entertaining little monkey, but now I'm tired of you. Get out of
    here, you dumb-ass.
  157: Numb-ass? Bye bye.
  158: Grrr! Me kill!

  102: You see a tall, muscular man in armor. His gear looks worn but well maintained.
  103: The NCR doesn't take kindly to quitters. Get out of here.

  107: "I'm Stanwell. I run the caravan between Redding and the New California Republic.
    Brahmin for\n gold. We could use an extra guard, and we're ready to leave right
    now. "
  108: |-
    People call me Stanwell. I run the caravan between Redding and the New California Republic.
     Brahmin for gold. Can usually use an extra hand or two. We leave town on the 11th day of every month.
     If you want to sign on, make sure you're here then.
  109: Something else?
  110: Moo-moos?
  111: You need a guard, huh?
  112: What does this caravan transport?
  113: Why are you waiting until the 11th?
  114: I don't think that's for me. Goodbye.
  115: Damn. I hate it when that happens.
  116: Same job. Different day.
  117: Nothing's ever easy.
  118: Where's a Ranger when you need one?
  119: Every damn trip these days.
  120: |-
    You're the worst excuse for a guard I've ever seen. You couldn't keep your word if your life
     depended on it.
  121: Get the hell out of here. You should know better.
  122: |-
    Did you really think that I'd reward a thief? You're lucky I didn't lynch you on the trail.
     I'm certainly not paying you anything. Now get out.
  123: A thief? I resemble that remark, you damn ingrate. I'm leaving. Goodbye.
  124: Someday soon, you'll regret crossing me. Goodbye.
  125: |-
    We got so torn up out there that I don't have enough money to pay you. Of course, if you'd done
     your job better, things would be different.
  126: You cheap bastard! You'll pay for stiffing me. Goodbye.
  127: Well, sometimes you just get luckier than others. This was one of the unlucky
    times. Goodbye.
  128: |-
    We didn't quite lose everything we had...but we lost more than I can afford. If you'd done your
     job right, you'd be getting more than this $500.
  129: Well, something is better than nothing, I guess. Goodbye.
  130: You lousy bastard! Nobody could have done a better job. You'll regret stiffing
    me. Goodbye.
  131: That wasn't too bad at all. Here's your $2000. Come on back if you need more
    work sometime.
  132: I don't think I ever want to spend so much time looking at the ass-end of a
    brahmin again. Goodbye.
  133: That wasn't too bad at all. See you later. Goodbye.
  134: |-
    That was a good run. Might not have worked out that way if you weren't along. Here's your $2000,
     plus a $500 bonus for the great job. Thanks again.
  135: Nice to find someone who appreciates quality when he sees it. See you around,
    maybe. Goodbye.
  136: Always glad to make some extra money. Thanks, and goodbye.
  137: |-
    I can't leave until we get a full load of ore. It'll all be ready to move on the 11th. Early in
     the day is best. Stop back then if you want a job.
  138: |-
    We need to get the brahmin in from the outlying settlements before we can get going. We'll be
     ready to move early on the 11th. Stop back on then if you want a job.
  139: What did you say you usually transport?
  140: Let me ask you something else.
  141: Thanks, I'll do that. Goodbye
  142: |-
    We're usually looking for caravan guards but, like I said, we won't be ready to go until the 11th
     of the month. If you still want a job with us, come back then.
  143: When on the 11th?
  144: What does this caravan transport?
  145: Okay, thanks. Goodbye.
  146: Sorry, pal, we've already got enough throwbacks working in this caravan.
  147: Oh, okay.
  148: |-
    We trade NCR's best brahmin for gold ore in Redding. Straight and simple - just the way I like
     things.
  149: Gotcha. You said you're looking for guards?
  150: Let me ask you something else.
  151: Oh, okay. Goodbye.
  152: |-
    You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $2000, but I'm only
     paying you for the job since I only need one more guard. Ready to join us?
  153: You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $2000.
    Ready to join us?
  154: Sounds great. I'm ready. Let's go.
  155: I can come up with better ways to spend my time than eating brahmin dust all
    day. Goodbye.
  156: Well, you got free eats and a safe trip here. Now get out of here, you moron.
  157: Gerg? Bye bye.
  158: Grrrr! Me want blood!

    we should settle it right here and now.
  139: He's with you? Then you're coming with us. We're going back to the Courtyard
    where you... and that thing... belong.
  140: All right, we'll go peacefully.
  141: Why don't you try to escort us out of here? I guarantee it'll be an educational

  150: Hrnghhhhhhhhhh!

  153: Hey, congratulations on defeating the Enclave!
  154: Welcome to Vault City, hero!
  155: Your battle against the Enclave impressed even the First Citizen.
  156: I heard you've traveled as far south as San Francisco. Is that true?
  157: Is it true that the U.S. was still fighting the war?
  158: You should catalog your travels in the Vault City computer.
  159: You're welcome to stay in Vault City as long as you want.
  160: You should catalog your exploits against the Enclave and put it up on the List
    Server.

    In a nutshell, my name is Chrissy and I'm from the Squat. I was out exploring last week when I
     found that entrance out there. I thought it might be an abandoned mine or something, so I decided to
     check it out. Well, it's not a mine; it's a secret entrance into Vault 15. The vault is being
     used as a base for a band of raiders called the Khans. They caught me snooping around and their leader, Darion, had me locked up in here.
  121: Okay. Me take you home.
  122: All right, I'll take you home.
  123: |-
    Well, I'll be damned. Today must be my lucky day. To what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you
     again?
  124: "[]"

  126: "[]"
  127: I'd like to know who you are and what is going on here.
  128: Please take me to my mother, Rebecca.
  129: |-
    My knight in shining armor returns. Well, it would shine if you'd clean it every once in a
     while. Oh, and you might want to consider bathing yourself as well. So, what can I do for you?
  130: Me just say hi. Me go now.
  131: Just thought I'd say hello. I'll be going now.
  132: |-
    Hey, I know I have a smart mouth, but I want you to know that I'm very grateful for you saving
     my butt. Thanks very much!
  133: You welcome.
  134: You're welcome.
  135: |-
    The people of the Squat are protecting these guys by helping them keep the vault a secret, but they
     don't know what's really going on here. Darion told us that the vault was being repaired so we could have
     a safe place to live with lots of food and water, but it's all a lie. I've been in there and looked
     around. The vault is dead, and the food and water machines don't work. Our food and water's been coming
     from the spoils
     of raids against caravans.
  136: |-
    Look, I've got to go home and warn everyone about what's really going on here. We can't help these
     monsters. Will you take me home?
bcdalia:
  100: You see a young woman in tattered clothing.
  101: You see Dalia.

    You see a young woman in tattered clothing. She seems very alert, and watches her surroundings
     carefully.

  104: Nothing, just say hi.
  105: Uh, who you?
  106: What you do here?
  107: You look like guard.
  108: Me go now.
  109: Just saying hello.
  110: Who are you?
  111: What are you doing?
  112: You look like you're guarding that trail.
  113: I'll be going now.
  114: Well, hello to you. Now, I'm sorry, but you should go.
  115: Me want talk.
  116: Ok, me go.
  117: I want to talk to you.
  118: Bye.

    anyone right now. Okay?
  120: Okay, bye.
  121: Just little more.
  122: Then I'll leave.
  123: I just want to ask you a question.
  124: I like the fresh air, I like the trees, so I'm standing here. Do you have a
    problem with that?
  125: Sorry, me go.
  126: No, not problem. Me ask you something.
  127: I don't have a problem, but I am curious about something.
  128: Sorry, I'll be going then.
  129: |-
    No, I'm not guarding the trail. There's nothing in this hole worth guarding. I told you, I'm
     enjoying the fresh air. Now go away.
  130: You nice talk to. Me talk more.
  131: Sorry me bother. Me go.

    Look, a young girl's life is at stake here. The daughter of a worried mother. Can you please

    stand here and guard\n this trail. Other than that, I don't know what's going
    on around here. I had a daughter once, though,\n and...yeah, some guy went by

    You see an animal with a lot of fur and four legs. If a dog could grin evilly, you would swear
     this one is doing it.
bcdargrd:
  100: You see a guard.

  102: He has armor, weapons, and a bad attitude - not the type of guy who likes your
    company.
bcdarion:
  100: You see an older man.
  101: You see Darion, leader of the New Khans.
  102: You see an older man with thin, gray hair. He seems to be in good shape for
    his age.
  103: |-
    So, here you are at last. The savior of the downtrodden, the righter of wrongs, the icon of
     hope for humanity. What a dumb-ass! Well, before you start any boring speeches, I'd just like to say
     that I'm not fucking interested. Let's just cut to the chase and get this over with.  Baddog, kill!

  104: I got my ID right here! Let me show ya.
  105: The name's... umm... Pat, and I'm new here.
  110: Man, Darion doesn't pay me enough to stand around here and do nothing.
  106: All right, wise-ass. Take your best shot.
  107: Oh yeah. Sorry. Didn't recognize you at first. Go on about your business.
  108: Hey, I'm not as stupid as you look.
  109: You're not dead yet? Shit.
  111: Sometimes I sit and think about absolutely nothing.
  112: I generally don't care what anyone else thinks.
  113: Ignorance is bliss... I think.
  114: When's the next caravan passing through? I could use some action.
  115: I could use a break.
  116: Damn, I still hurt from that bitch Chrissy kicking me.
  117: Hey, we never get any new blood around here.
  118: So when are we going to get out of this stupid place?
  119: I don't know about you, but I think this sucks.
  120: There ain't nothin' to kill around here.
  121: Where's the damn bathroom?
  122: Hey, we never get a break around here. Isn't there some law or something?
  123: We should start up a government like in the old days.
  124: Man, I wonder what it was like to be President back then?
  125: I bet you could do anything you wanted if you were President.
  126: I think my father would be proud of me today. Too bad I killed him.
  127: I HATE RATS! HATE HATE HATE!
  128: Hey, is that new armor you have on? How do you rate getting new armor?
  129: This damn vault smells. Don't you hate it?
  130: Hey, who is it we're supposed to be keeping an eye open for?
  131: All I do is stand, stand, stand.
  132: I think we should just waste everyone upstairs and say to hell with this place.
  133: What the hell is your problem with rats?
  134: Have you ever pulled one of the legs off of a rat?
  135: 'I like guns, yeah! GUNS I LIKE! GUNS: I REALLY, REALLY LIKE THEM!'
  136: Hey, is anyone listening to me?
  137: Oh well, I just talk to keep myself sane anyway.
  138: Hey, anyone remember what was in a Long Island Ice Tea?
  139: Yeah, vodka, rum, tequila, triple sec, lime, and Nuka.
  140: Hey, look -- the lights came on. What the...
  141: Darion said he'd get the damn lights fixed. I guess he came through.
  142: I don't think the generator just fixes itself, does it?
  143: That was kind of weird; now I can see. Jesus, this place looks like shit!
  144: Wow, it's bright in here. Where's the dimmer control?

    We're a very private community here, and we don't want any trouble or interference from outside

  111: I'm crippled. Can you help me?
  112: I wanted to ask you some questions.
  113: Just saying hello.
  114: |-
    Why, certainly. Here, we'll give you a shot of this -- this'll sting a bit -- now a bandage,
     and there, you're all set.
  115: Me thank. Bye.
  116: Thanks, Doc. I feel much better.
  117: |-
    Why, certainly. Here, you'll need to drink this -- all of it, I know it tastes foul. Now, just
     lie down on the bed over there, and I'll wake you in the morning.
  118: Me feel good. Bye.
  119: Thanks Doc, that did the trick.
  120: |-
    I'm sorry, but I don't have the proper facilities to perform surgery. I'd suggest you go to one
     of the bigger cities and see a surgeon. Try Vault City. It's north of here.
  121: Okay. Bye
  122: All right. Thanks anyway.
  123: What would you like to know?
  124: You work Darion?
  125: You leave here when want?
  126: What you know about Darion?
  127: How you be here?
  128: You say Darion got doggie?
  129: Me go now.
  130: Do you work for Darion?
  131: Can you leave here if you want?
  132: What can you tell me about Darion?
  133: How did you come to be here in the first place?
  134: You mentioned Darion has a dog?
  135: Thanks for the information. I'll be heading out now.
  136: |-
    Well, yes and no. It's not by choice. I'm a prisoner here. Darion is getting up there in years
     and he needs a dedicated physician to look after him. The Khans keep me here for his needs. I'd rather
     be here for the people in the town above. They have no medical help at all, and there is a lot I can
     do to aid them.
  137: Okay. Need know more.
  138: Thanks. Bye.
  139: That's very commendable of you.
  140: I see. I'll be going now.
  141: They're squatters! Let 'em die. Get on with your life.
  142: |-
    No, I'm pretty much trapped here. I can't even leave to refill my medical supplies. Darion
     sends out for anything I need.
  143: Me got it. Go now.
  144: Need ask more.
  145: I guess you just aren't a trustworthy enough person to be allowed freedom.
  146: All right. I'm sorry, but I have to get going.
  147: I'm sorry to hear that.
  148: |-
    Darion is a mental case, plain and simple. He's got more spooks in his head than his dog has
     fleas. As far as I can figure it, he was a member of another gang called the Khans. They kidnapped
     this girl, Tandi, and held her for ransom. Her father didn't take kindly to that, and hired some merc
     to get her back. Darion was the only one to come out alive.
  149: Uh... what you said.
  150: Got go now.
  151: Uh-huh. Well, I'll be leaving now.
  152: Wow; I'm impressed with your knowledge.
  153: Sounds like my kind of guy.
  154: |-
    I was kidnapped. I was traveling from Vault City to New Reno for a well-deserved vacation. Went
     to bed one night and woke up bound and gagged the next morning. A week or so later, I was here. Been
     here ever since.
  155: Ugh.
  156: Thanks. Me be leave now.
  157: The weak are often the prey of the strong.
  158: I'm sorry to hear that.
  159: Interesting, but I need to get going.
  160: |-
    Yeah, he's got a dog. Personally, I think it's the meanest, most vile creature on the face of
     the earth. It seems to love Darion, though, so I guess it can't be all that bad.
  162: Uh, bye.
  163: I see. Well, thanks for the warning.
  164: Ah. Well, I've got to go.
  165: I'll not help someone like you. Go away.
  166: Okay, well, you take care, and come back if you need anything.
  167: Done.
  168: |-
    Now he's paranoid. He believes that Tandi is out to get him. He's obsessed with revenge, and he
     wants Tandi dead. He's riddled with guilt 'cause he hid and lived, rather than dying with his
     gang... and the list goes on and on.

    nice day!
  120: Hmm. Nothing, I guess I'll be going now.
  121: |-
    I can't believe that you think you can just waltz in here and get answers to your questions!
     Oh, what the hell, you're about to die anyway and I feel generous. We've got her kid locked in the
     back room and have been having some fun with her. That bitch, Rebecca, has been trying to find her, so
     we've been keeping an eye open to make sure she doesn't get too close.

     the pain.

  142: Let's see who comes out of this alive.

  105: Why need talk private?
  106: Okay.

  115: No, me go.

  117: Why the need for privacy?
  118: No thanks, I don't want to get involved.
  119: |-
    (whispering) You may think I'm crazy but I get the feeling I'm being watched all the time. It's
     rather disturbing, and I'm a bit on edge because of it.
  120: Okay, we go private.
  121: No time for sicky in head.
  122: All right; where can we go to talk?
  123: Sorry, I don't like the sound of this.

  125: Okay.
  126: We should be able to talk here.
  127: Okay, what problem?
  128: Me got questions first.
  129: Okay, so what's so important?
  130: I have some questions for you, first.
  131: |-
    I have a daughter named Chrissy who's a bit of a tomboy. She likes to run around, explore,
     and pretty much stick her nose into things. Chrissy's a good kid, though. She doesn't
     cause trouble, she's always home on time and she's shown herself to be a very responsible young lady.
     I let her do as she pleases most of the time. Last week Chrissy didn't come home. I've asked
     around, and nobody's seen or heard from her. I tried to find her myself, but Zeke, he's... sort of the
     mayor here... stopped me. He said it wasn't safe for me to go out looking on my own; he'd have some of
     his men do it. They couldn't find her, either, and said that maybe the slavers got her.
  132: No, not get involved.
  133: Need think before decide.
  134: Ok, me seem be hero type lately.
  135: Sorry, not interested.
  136: I need to think about this.
  137: All right, Rebecca. I'll try to help you.
  138: If I help you, what's in it for me?
  139: What do you want to know?
  140: What go on here?
  141: Who boss?
  142: Me try find Vault 13. You know where is?
  143: Tell about vault.
  144: Tell about Darion.
  145: Thanks. We talk you problem?
  146: What's going on around here?
  147: Who's in charge around here?
  148: I'm looking for Vault 13. Do you know anything about it?
  149: Tell me about the vault.
  150: So tell me about Darion.
  151: Thanks Rebecca. Let's talk about your problem now.
  152: |-
    We call this place the 'Squat' because it was settled by the homeless of many cities. It's not
     much, but it's all we have. To the west is a city called the NCR. They've known about us for quite some
     time, and never offered us any kind of help or hindrance. Now, they are suddenly claiming this area as their
     ancestral home, and they want it back.
  153: Okay.
  154: What here they want?
  155: I see.
  156: What is here that they want so badly?
  157: |-
    Well... there is a vault here; I think it's number 15. They want to loot it for any of the old
     technology that may still be there.
  158: Ah. Me understand.
  159: I knew there had to be something here other than the waste-of-flesh inhabitants.
  160: Got it.
  161: That explains a lot. You've been very helpful. I need to ask some more questions,
    though.
  162: |-
    That would be Zeke. He runs everything up here. You can find him in the building over there.
     ::points north-east::
  163: Thanks. Ask more.
  164: Thank you. I need to ask you some more questions.
  165: |-
    I'm sorry, I have no idea. I would ask about it in NCR. They've taken a great interest in
     vaults lately.
  166: Okay, me do.
  167: All right, I will.
  168: |-
    Well... we're not supposed to talk about it, but since I need your help... The vault is being
     repaired by Darion. He's our benefactor. When it's fully functional, we're all supposed to move in
     where we'll be safe from raiders, slavers, and such. So far he has the food and water systems up, but
     that's about it.
  169: Me see. Need know more.
  170: I need to know more.
  171: |-
    There's not much to say, really. Darion keeps to himself and never leaves the vault. If he has
     anything to say, he says it through Zeke. I've only met him once, and he seemed like a nice guy.
  172: Okay.
  173: Nice guys finish last. I wonder what he's up to?
  174: I see.
  175: That's okay. You are very helpful.
  176: I have nothing to give you other than my undying gratitude.
  177: That's more than enough. I'll help you.
  178: It'll take more than that to buy my help.
  179: What the hell, I'll help you.
  180: |-
    Thank you so much. I'll never be able to repay you for this. I'll wait here until you bring...
     Hey, there was someone outside listening to us! I saw their shadow on the tent wall. They just ran off
     that way! ::points north-east:: They must have heard everything!
  181: Me stop, no get away!
  182: You no worry, me find girl.
  183: Ooops.

  185: They won't stop me from finding your daughter.
  186: Oh well. Shit happens.
  187: Please, just go away.
  188: Have you thought things through?
  189: Me ask questions.
  190: No, still think.
  191: No, I'm still considering everything.
  192: I want to ask you some questions.
  193: Have you changed your mind? Will you help me?
  194: Sorry, no.

    My daughter has told me everything. I find it hard to believe that Darion is such a monster
     after all he's been doing for us. And to think, we've been helping him hide his operations as a raider.
     I can guarantee you we won't stand for it any longer. I've already talked to Zeke, and he wants to see
     you. You should go see him now.

    I can't explain why, but I don't believe the slavers took her. I've an uneasy feeling that
     something else is going on. And then there's this feeling that I'm being followed. I've had it ever
     since I talked to Zeke about Chrissy. I need someone to help me find my daughter. Will you help me,
     please?
  208: |-
    They keep sending people here to try and talk us out of our home, but they don't understand

    You know, it's kind of funny that they managed to get something that complex fixed, but not the
     lights. The damn place is lit by torches. Anyway, Darion doesn't want anyone to know what's going on
     with the vault. He's afraid that someone will take it all away from us if they find out. So, we're told
     to drive off anyone who shows up here -- especially the NCR.

    My name's Zeke, stranger. I'm sorry, but I don't have time to talk to you -- and I don't think
     there's anything in this town for you, anyway. You should move on.
  104: Uh, okay.
  105: Me got questions.
  106: All right, I'll leave.
  107: I just wanted to ask a couple of questions.
  108: |-
    Well, I think you'll find that we're all out of answers here. Why don't you come back when we
     get a shipment in?
  109: Done.
  110: |-
    Hello, again. I still don't have any answers for you, stranger. Why don't you take a hint and
     get the duck out of fodge?
  111: Done.
  112: |-
    Rebecca has told me what you did for her. I want to apologize for the treatment you received
     here. You certainly didn't deserve it. What can I help you with?
  113: Me got questions.
  114: Nothing. Wavy.
  115: I've got some questions for you.
  116: Nothing for now, thanks.
  117: What do you want to know?
  118: You work for Darion?
  119: What you do about raiders?
  120: Where vault door?
  121: Anything else go on here?
  122: Me leave now.
  123: Do you work for Darion?
  124: What do you intend to do about the raiders?
  125: Where is the vault entrance?
  126: Is there anything else going on around here?
  127: I guess that's it. I'll be going now.
  128: |-
    Yes, I do. I act as the middle man between him and the people up here. I'm not very happy about
     the fact, now that I know what he's up to.
  129: Okay.
  130: I see.
  131: |-
    Nothing. They have the guns, they control the water, and they control the food. That means
     they are in charge. Period. We have no skills and no means of support without the backing of Darion.
     How can we turn against him? We're at his mercy.
  132: Hmm. Me think me understand.
  133: Hmm. I see.
  134: |-
    It's behind that door over there, but it's locked from the other side and trapped, too. I don't have
     any means of opening it... Wait a minute. I found this key card some time ago, and I have no idea what
     it is for. Rebecca says that you found some sort of door where they were holding Chrissy. Maybe this
     card will open it. Here, take it.
  135: Me thank you.
  136: Thanks. I'll give it a try.
  137: |-
    There's a city west of here called NCR. They claim Vault 15 is their ancestral home and they want it
     back. They've been sending people here trying to talk us into leaving but we aren't going for it. This is the only home we know.
  138: You maybe make deal NCR?
  139: Would you consider making a deal with NCR?
  140: That all depends. What did you have in mind?
  141: Join NCR tribe. Learn from elders. Give NCR you permission enter vault. Both
    happy.
  142: |-
    Join NCR, let them annex your territory, and give them access to the vault. In return, they can teach you all the skills
     you need to survive on your own and offer you their protection.
  143: |-
    Not bad... I like it. You've got yourself a deal if you can get NCR to agree to it as well. But...
     Look, someone has to take care of Darion and his cronies. It should be done now before they realize what has happened
     and have time to prepare for an attack. Why not get this over with and take Darion out now?
     You'll have the element of surprise on your side.
  144: You right, me take care of.
  145: Me not sure.
  146: Yeah, I guess it has to be done.
  147: I don't know.
  148: Excellent. Good luck to you, and thank you.
  149: Done.
  150: |-
    Well, take the time to think about it, but know this -- until Darion is out of the picture, I
     have no choice but to maintain things around here as they are. It's for the safety of everyone
     concerned. That means no deal and you are still persona non grata. Understand?
  151: Okay.
  152: Hi. I'm still waiting for a final resolution to our troubles. In other words,
    kick Darion's ass!
  153: Done.
  154: |-
    You've done it, friend! We're no longer under Darion's yoke. Thank you! I'm ready to accept your deal with NCR now.
     Just have them send one of their reps by and I'll seal the deal.
  155: Done.
  156: Thanks for the chance of a new life. We all owe you.
  157: Just go away. I have nothing to say to you.
  158: |-
    Wait, before you go... I found this key card some time ago, and I have no idea what it’s for.
     Rebecca says that you found some sort of entrance where they were holding Chrissy. Maybe this card will
     open it. Here, take it.
  159: Thanks.
  160: What can I help you with?
  161: Just the problems with the NCR, but I think the deal you offered will solve
    that.
  162: You've done it, friend! We're no longer under Darion's yoke. Thank you!
  163: Now that Darion's gone we don't have any way to get food. We will surely perish!
    Thanks a lot.

  118: Sure, I'll do it.
  119: I'll think about it.
  120: |-
    (Xarn stares at you intently for a moment) Very well.
     The Enclave created my people as a slave warrior race. They
     enhanced our intellect hoping we could better understand their
     commands, and yet not recognize our status as slaves.
     They failed; we are much more intelligent than they suspect.
  121: |-
    We decided to play the fool until we could gain our
     freedom. Our chance arrived when the Enclave decided to test
     us outside their control, here on the mainland. Doctor Schreber
     opposed their decision, but he was overruled.
  122: |-
    Not accepting the Enclave decision, he chose exile to this base,
     captured me, and has been performing experiments to determine my
     true nature. He has been successful. When he reports his findings
     to the Enclave my people will be hunted down and slain. I must
     escape and warn my people.
  123: |-
    (Xarn stares at you intently for a moment) I have nothing
     to tell you, human. I can sense the darkness of your soul.
  124: If doctor such threat why you no kill?
  125: Screw you then. Me shoot you ass.
  126: If this guy is such a threat, then why didn't you just kill him?
  127: Up yours, then. Die, deathclaw.
  128: |-
    (sigh) Recently I began to consider just such an action,
     even though it is not my way to kill. I am certain the doctor
     noticed because he stopped seeing me in person. The choice is
     no longer mine to make.
  129: You not worry. Doctor dead. He not make report.
  130: Me thank you for story.
  131: |-
    You don't have to worry. The doc is dead and he
     didn't make the report.
  132: Thanks for the story. It was interesting.
  133: |-
    I am sorry to hear of his death but it is for the
     better that this is so. I would ask you to help me escape
     this place. Will you?
  134: Yes, me do.
  135: Me think about it.
  136: No, me no think so.
  137: Yeah, I'll do it.
  138: No, but I'll think about it.
  139: No, I don't think so.
  140: Very well... I will wait here until you come to a decision.
  141: Done.
  142: |-
    Very well... I am saddened by your decision but it is
     your choice. If you change your mind, I will be here.
  143: Bye.
  144: Goodbye.
  145: I would ask you to help me escape this place. Will you?
  146: Yes, me do.
  147: Me think about it.
  148: No, me no think so.
  149: Yeah, I'll do it.
  150: No, but I'll think about it.
  151: No, I don't think so.
  152: Hello again. Are you ready for our battle?
  153: No want fight, want hear you story.
  154: Me not want fight. Me here rescue you.
  155: No. Me go.
  156: Yes. Me ready.
  157: I don't really want to fight. Can I hear your story instead?
  158: I'm here to rescue you, not fight.
  159: No. I'll be leaving now.
  160: All right, let's get it over with.
  161: Hello again. Have you changed your mind? Will you help me?
  162: Yes.
  163: No.
  164: Hello again. Have you changed your mind? Will you help me?
  165: Yes.
  166: No. Me still think about it.
  167: No. Me not help.
  168: No, I'm still thinking.
  169: I don't want to help you.
  170: Hello again. Have you found the key to the door?
  171: Yes, me open for you.
  172: Me still look.
  173: Yeah, I've got it. I'll open the door for you.
  174: I'm still looking.
  175: Thank you. I will not forget this.
  176: You welcome.
  177: You are welcome.
  178: Thank you again, my friend. I owe you a debt that can not be repaid.
  179: Greetings, human. The base is on full alert. Are you by any chance the cause?
  180: Hello again. The base is on full alert. Are you the cause?
  181: Yes, me cause. Who you, why you want know?
  182: Yes, me cause. Why?
  183: I am Xarn, pack warrior. Allow me to join you and fight at your side for our
    freedom. Together we stand a chance; alone... who knows?
  184: |-
    Then allow me to join you and fight at your side. Together
     we may be able to gain our freedom; alone... who knows?
  185: Before me decide you tell why you here?
  186: Uh... okay. You come me. We fight way out together.
  187: You on you own. Me out of here.
  188: Before I come to any decision I'd like to know why you're here?
  189: Fine. We're in this together. Load up your claws and let's party down!
  190: You're on your own pal. I'm out of here.
  191: Uh... okay. You come me. We fight way out together.
  192: You on you own. Me out of here.
  193: Fine. We're in this together. Load up your claws and let's party down!
  194: You're on your own pal. I'm out of here.
  195: I thank you, human. Let us kick some Enclave ass! Pack Gruthar! Grrrrrrrhh!
  196: Okay.
  200: "[More]"
  201: Yes. Who are you?
  202: Yes. Why?
  300: |-
    Very well. The Enclave created my people as a slave warrior race.
     They enhanced our intellect hoping we could better understand their
     commands, and yet not recognize our status as slaves. They failed; we are
     much more intelligent than they suspect.
  301: |-
    We decided to play the fool until we could gain our freedom. Our
     chance arrived when the Enclave decided to test us outside their control, here

     been successful. When he reports his findings to the Enclave my people will be
     hunted down and slain. I must escape and warn my people.
  500: |-
    You are a true Pack brother. May we meet again in more peaceful times.
     I must go now to prepare my people for war.
  501: I am going to tear off your limbs and beat you with them.
  502: Die, treacherous human!
  503: This will hurt you a lot more than it does me.
  600: Together we will crush our enemies.
  601: You line 'em up and I'll knock 'em down.
  602: Time for some serious head bashing.
  700: You see a deathclaw. It watches you with strangely intelligent eyes.
  701: You see Xarn, the deathclaw.
  702: You see a typical deathclaw. The creature is huge, with a powerful body, sharp
    teeth, and long claws.
  800: You killed Xarn.
  810: You freed Xarn.
  820: You joined Xarn.
cowbomb:
  100: You have a funny feeling about this place.  The enchanting smell of cow dung
    and rotting flesh eminates a few feet from here.
dcAddict:
  100: You see a reliant.
  101: This person is heavily chemmed.
  102: He looks like he's high on chems.
  103: She looks like she's high on chems.
  104: He's looking pretty bad. You suspect it's withdrawal from some kind of chem.
  105: She's seen better days. She looks like she's going through withdrawal.
  106: This reliant looks like the living dead.
  107: You think this reliant just threw up.
  150: The lights are hurting me!
  151: Monsters everywhere!
  152: That felt weird.
  153: Am I bleeding?
  154: It doesn't normally seem this real.
  155: Stop it, man!
  156: Will no one help me?
  157: Help!
  158: Get away!
  159: My head hurts enough as it is!
  160: Leave me alone.
  200: Wow, you've got a weird dark glow.
  201: My, you're a big pup.
  202: Don't tell them what we know is not there.
  203: Ahhh…
  204: Can you see me?
  205: Be vewy, vewy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits.
  206: How did you get way up here?
  207: Shhh, I'm hiding.
  208: I'm running faster than a wolf!
  209: I feel so alive!
  210: It's coursing through my veins…
  211: Right there, baby.
  212: Oooohhh, can you feel the power?
  213: Wow, you're glowing…
  214: I love you, man!
  215: Life's been so good to me. Has it been good to you?
  216: The little ones fly at night.
  217: Say hello to my little friend.
  218: Boy, I'm sleepy…
  219: Have you seen my dog?
  220: Shhh, they're right behind you…
  221: Mine!
  222: Oooh, my head.
  223: I ache all over.
  224: I'm starting to get the shakes.
  225: Oh, I need some more.
  226: I need a fix.
  227: I can't wait, I need it now.
  228: You take my shit?
  229: Ah, leave me alone.
  230: I got the shakes bad, man.
  231: I hate this part.
  232: I just want to die.
  233: I need some more bad.
  234: I can't take this much longer.
  235: I think I have a fever.
  236: I think I'm going to puke.
  237: Maybe if I just sleep…
  238: I got the shakes bad, lady.
  300: Is that blood?
  301: Whoa! Am I beeding? I can can't feel a thing!
  302: It tingles.
  303: Who did that?
  304: What's going on?
  305: I'm bleeding… I think.
  306: Oh, the pain.
  307: Now I really need a fix.
  308: Just let me die.
  350: Ahhhh…
  351: I'm floating…
  352: I have the power!
  353: Hello, Mr. Flower.
  354: All the colors…
  355: More longer friend see that sky?
  356: They aren't listening…
  357: Where am I?
  358: There it is!
  359: Whoa, no! Stop! Wait! Okay, go ahead.
  360: There, there… ahh…
  361: Yea, baby!
  362: What was that?
  363: Sasha? Where are you Sasha?
  364: The colors are fading!
  365: Mom?
  366: Hey! Get away from me! Oh…
  367: Don't you do that!
  368: I can't see… again.
  369: Need…
  370: Get more…
  371: There? No.
  372: No. Can't find it.
  373: Make it stop!
  374: Ug.
  375: Oh, the pain.
  376: "<cough> <cough> <cough>"
  377: Ooh, my head!
  378: Where'd I put my stash?
  400: A demon!
  401: The enemy is upon us!
  402: You murderer! You killed by son!
  403: A monster! Kill it!
  404: Ah! Pargasraka!
  405: Feet fom chin rat going! Ahhh!
  406: You won't take it from me!
  407: Give it back!
  408: No!!!
  409: My family!
dcAnan:
  100: You see a short man with a thick mustache.
  101: You see the Great Ananias.
  102: You see a short, mustachioed, man with a somewhat furtive look to him.
  103: You! What do you want to do to the, formerly, Great Ananias now?
  104: Get away from me!
  105: Go ruin someone else's business.
  106: Take it out on someone else.
  107: You've already done your worst to me.
  108: Just go away, you've done enough harm to me.
  109: I'm so hungry.
  110: How will I ever feed my family now?
  111: You were born with a heart 12 sizes too small.
  112: No, my friend, a MUMMY! Straight from the sands of ancient Egypt to the sands
    of the Wastes! Exclusively for you to see!
  113: OK, I'll bite. How much to see the wizened corpse?
  114: "(too yourself) Hmm, a mummy would kinda describe the way a ghoul looks. OK,
    I'd like to take a look -- how much?"
  115: I've seen enough corpses already. Goodbye.
  116: Hello, welcome, salutations! I am the Great Ananias (he offers you a slight
    bow, with a flourish). I bring mysteries from near and far friend. Mysteries from
    a world beyond our own... of the Netherworld.
  117: Come back to learn of the Great Ananias' mysteries of the Netherworld have
    you?
  118: What kind of mysteries?
  119: Uh, nice to meet you Mr. Great Anus...something.
  120: Hmm, mysteries make me sleep uneasily, I better go. Goodbye.
  121: Step right up!
  127: Today, in the room within, I have, for your eyes exclusively...A Jan-u-wine
    Egyptian Mummy!
  128: A mummy?
  129: A mummy? Hmm, I wonder if it could be.... No, nobody could be that stupid.
  130: I don't have any interest in that sort of thing. Corpses scare me.
  131: Out of the way, you're blocking paying customers.
  132: I don't think this is for you.
  133: Why don't you take your little tribal self elsewhere.
  134: This isn't really for you.
  135: I see, hmmm, how about GO (he points) AWAY!
  136: For a person of your obvious class I would be happy to show this unique, and
    historic, specimen to you for a mere $25.
  137: OK, I'll cough up the dough. Now...Show Me The Mummy!
  138: I don't want to spend that much. I think I'll survive without seeing the thing.
    Goodbye.
  139: Simply open the sarcophagus lid and the marvelous Mummy will be revealed, in
    all its ancient glory, to you. But please, no touching, and, uh, no flash photography.
  140: Great.
  141: There you go! The MUMMY! (the door to the sarcophagus swings open to reveal
    a desiccated corpse, that looks very much like an ordinary ghoul, standing in
    a poorly painted, chipped and cracked paper-mache sarcophagus.)
  142: There you go! Presenting, the MUMMY! (a crypt-like door swings open to reveal
    a jan-u-wine Egyptian mummy standing in an open sarcophagus that looks as though
    it's made out of pure gold!)
  143: Hey, wait a minute. That's not a Mummy. That's a ghoul. WOODY! Hey WOODY! Is
    that you?
  144: That sure looks like a ghoul to me.
  145: That's a mummy? I can't believe I just paid $25 to see a six-foot hunk of jerky.
    Goodbye.
  146: Wow, that's fantastic...I guess. (you look at the Mummy very intently for a
    while). Uh, thanks, Goodbye.
  147: "(the Mummy, snorts, stretches languidly, and then looks at you with a sleepy
    blink to it's eyes) Hello. (he says, sleepily)"
  148: Holy shit! That *is* Woody! Run Woody, run for it! Well, uh, gimp for it then!
    Go Woody go!
  149: I assure you that the Mummy is, in fact, quite jan-u-wine.
  150: I don't think I believe you. Let me try something. WOODY! Hey WOODY! Is that
    you?
  151: Well, if you say so. But I sure think it looks like an ordinary ghoul. Goodbye.
  152: |-
    (Woody--for it is in fact Woody, not a Mummy, that stands somewhat drowsily before you--grabs the sides of the
     paper-
    mache sarcophagus, lets out a shriek and runs for the door, leaving a trail of toilet-paper 'mummy-wrappings'
     and a hasty "Thankee kindly, Stranger!" behind him.)
  153: Hah! I knew it! You're finished in this town. You're not the Great Ananias
    anymore, you're just another ass.
  154: Go Woody go! Ahah! I knew it!
  155: "(The Great Ananias shrugs) I knew I should have picked up that mono-headed
    Brahmin instead. Oh well, back to the drawing board."
  156: Mono-headed brahmin? Sure, who would ever believe that! Goodbye, you Charlatan.
  157: You woke up Woody the ghoul and freed him from indentured mummy-tude.
  158: I think I'd rather hear the ghost story.
  200: |-
    I know things that mere mortal man is not meant to know. Aiiieeee! Nyarloth...Oh, sorry (heh, heh). Got a little carried away
     there for a moment. I have tales of a Ghost that haunts these very grounds, as well as a Jan-u-wine Egypt-ee-an Mummy that you
     can see, right here in this marvelous sarcophagus.
  201: Tell me about the mummy. I'm just dying to hear more about that.
  202: I've just got to hear that ghost story. Uh, do I get a nice hot cup of cocoa
    to go with it?
  203: I don't think I have any more time to waste on whatever it is that you're hawking.
  300: |-
    Well, you see, (he motions you closer) there was once a great queen that ruled all of the surrounding town. She kept her
     throne by virtue of a special amulet that she kept around her neck at all times. Great stuff, huh?
  301: |-
    Uh, yeah. You bet. So this princess had a *magic* amulet. Oh, do go on. I just can't stand this level of suspense
     much longer (yawn).
  302: OK. I think I've heard just about enough. Goodbye.
  400: |-
    Well, I'll cut to the chase then. So, the evil wizard poisoned the young princess and took her amulet. She's been wandering
     around the room next door ever since. Well, uh, that is, just at the witching hour, anyway. That's why I keep the door locked.
     Pretty darn scary, huh?
  401: |-
    The ghost of an amuletless princess in the trashed room next door? That's it? I can't believe you're peddling *that* as a story.
     I'd rather hear about this stupid Mummy you're supposed to have here.
  402: OK. I think I've heard just about enough. Goodbye.
dcAnna:
  100: You see a ghost!
  101: You see Anna the ghost.
  150: This a ghost. That's not something you see every day.
  151: She seems quite tormented.
  152: "[TALK]"
  153: Oh, the pain! It burns so!
  154: What’s the matter?
  155: Who are you?
  156: Begone, foul spirit!
  157: I stop and knock at every door, but no one comes, no one hears.
  158: I can hear you. What’s the matter?
  159: I think you need to turn off your Stealth Boy, ma'am.
  160: Where is it? I cannot find it! I am lost! Oh....
  161: What are you looking for? Maybe I can help.
  162: You really need to stop moaning and groaning and start making sense.
  163: My locket! It is gone. Thief! Thief!
  164: Whoa, I just got here. I didn’t do it.
  165: Can I help you find it?
  166: Oh, cruel fate.
  167: You can’t hear me, can you?
  168: Later, ghost girl.
  169: Bye. I’ll try to help.
  170: My locket! Give it to me!!! Oh!!!!
  171: No way! Go to hell. I found this fair and square.
  172: OK. Here you go.
  173: Here. May you rest in peace.
  174: OK.
  175: No.
  176: My locket, my locket! I’m coming, Daddy! I’m coming!
  177: Goodbye.
  178: Wait! Don’t go!
  179: Go into the light.
  200: Where could it be?
  201: Ohhh.
  202: Mommy? Daddy? Where are you?
  203: I can't find it!
  500: Mommy... Daddy... I'm coming...
  501: It's so bright...
  502: Grammy, I can see you...
  503: Oh, it's the kind Mr. Cain. It's good to see you again...
  550: This house is clear.
  560: GHOST BUSTER!
  561: Ug.
dcAtkSlv:
  245: Quiet! They near.
  246: Kill bad men.
  247: No take family from me.
  248: I protect family.
  249: Must not find us.
  250: They bad people.
  260: Slavers are coming. Everyone quiet.
  261: Get ready. I think they're close now.
  262: I'm not going down without a fight.
  263: They'll never enslave us.
  264: Those slavers will pay for this.
  265: No slaver's going to take my family.
  100: This man looks fairly strong and alert.
  101: She seems strong despite her size.
  200: He seems to be awfully thin but angry.
  201: This one looks fairly strong.
  202: He moves with great speed.
  210: She doesn't seem to have ever bathed.
  211: She looks like strong fighter.
  212: This one doesn't seem like much trouble.
  300: You die now!
  301: Me kill!
  302: You no hurt family!
  303: You no take family!
  304: I protect!
  305: I hurt you!
  306: You pay!
  307: Die!
  308: I'm gonna hurt you.
  350: You're not going to take my family, slaver!
  351: Die, slaving scum!
  352: You'll pay, you bastard!
  353: I'll fight to the death for my family!
  354: You won't get away with this!
  355: You're not leaving here with my friends!
  356: I'm going to get you for this!
  357: God damn slavers!
  358: You'll pay for this!
dcBilly:
  100: You see a patron of the Hole.
  150: This fellow sure isn't very attractive.
  151: This guy's only got one tooth.
  152: "[TALK]"
  153: Your wife sure is pretty!
  154: Get away from us.
  155: You like her, huh?
  156: Yes, she is.
  157: Yup.
  158: I sure would like to do her.
  159: Go right ahead.
  160: OK. That’ll be $50.
  161: Sure, but it’ll cost you $200.
  162: No way! Get away from us!
  163: OK.
  164: No.
  165: Alright! Now come with Billy, sweetie.
  166: Now go away.
  167: Thanks. Bye.
  168: Bye.
  169: Aw, shucks.
  170: "[done]"
  171: I am plumb tuckered out.
  172: I’ll come back.
  173: OK.
  174: You sure are a pretty thing.
  175: Get away from me.
  176: Give me $200 and you can spend some time with me.
  177: I cost $50, Mac.
  178: Hee hee. Thanks.
  179: I don’t have enough money.
  180: Ok, $50 then.
  181: Too bad for you.
  182: See you around.
  183: Don’t bother me. I’m scoping for nice-looking chicks.
  184: Good luck. You’ll need it.
  185: What am I, chopped liver?
  186: Bye.
  187: Oooh. OK. Bye.
  188: "[looks you up and down] No. I like chopped liver."
  189: I don’t need this from you!
  190: Excuse me, I have to go.
  191: Too bad. I thought you were cute.
  203: I want my money back.
  204: I ain't giving you anything but a hole in the head.

  196: Metzger means butcher. Fitting, don't you think?
  197: |-
    That was my great grandfather's name. He can from somewhere far to
     the east. Across a large body of water.
  198: I read some book about a Metzger. He was a president, or something.
  199: Look who's talking trible.
  200: |-
    It's Germen, German, Garmen, or something. Ancient language, from a

  223: No. I have another question though.
  224: No, never mind.

  228: Thanks, gotta go.
  229: Vault City is east of here, and a little south. Vic's from there.

  251: " but no more!"
  252: Sold!
  253: Not good enough.

    me.
  256: I’d like to buy him.
  257: Why are you keeping him here?
  258: Nothing. Never mind.

    You returned no slaves at all! What the hell is wrong with you? We're trying to make money here,

  322: You need to improve your enslavement technique.
  323: I will try.
  324: I apologize for my poor performance.
  325: I think I’m good enough.
  326: |-
    Damn it! You did terribly in this Run. Are you trying to ruin me? Be more careful next time.
     You don't need to kill them all! Just kill off the hostile ones. Leave the unarmed ones for collection.
  327: I’m sorry, Metzger.
  328: Hey, it’s tough work to be a Slaver!
  329: I’d like to see you do better.
  330: I'd like to go on a slave run.
  331: Damn it! I hate losing any guildmember on a Run. Try to watch each others back!
  332: Overall, you did well this Run. Here is $

    really fuck it up fast.
  207: Yes, it is.
  208: I have a better idea.
  209: Nope. I’ll let you know when it is.
  210: Then here’s the $500. Thanks.
  211: Nice doing business with you.
  212: You know, Frankie, she’s just going to build another one.
  213: Thanks, bye.
  214: Damn! Well, in the mean time she’ll have no booze.
  215: Why fight her, Frankie? Join her.
  216: Think. Where else can you get liquor?
  217: What do you mean?
  218: Buy liquor from her. It’s cheaper than New Reno’s, so you’ll make more money,
    too.
  219: I don’t want to do this.
  220: Never mind.
  221: Look, I just want her still destroyed. Will you do it?
  222: Alright, I will.
  223: No, I won’t. Good bye.
  224: Maybe you’re right. I’ll talk to her. Thanks.
  225: Hey, what are friends for?
  226: Bye.
  227: Information I do not have.
  228: Really? How about why Becky’s drinks are so much cheaper than yours?
  229: I thought bartenders knew everything.
  230: Then I’m in the wrong place. Bye.
  231: Go talk to Sheila. Hey, Sheila, you got a customer!
  232: Wait, that’s not what I want!
  233: Thanks. Bye.
  234: Yeah, I bet. You must have the damnedest time getting men. Try your luck somewhere
    else, sister. I ain't into no charities.
  235: Fine! Something else then.
  236: Why, you little...
  237: I don’t need this from you!
  238: I have a room over there. You and I can use it.
  239: OK.
  240: No, I didn’t mean that!
  242: Neither were you.
  243: I might have tried if you knew how to please a woman.
  244: You were the best I ever had. Really. I mean that.
  245: I hate to eat and run, but...
  246: Well, see you later.
  247: Bye.
  248: Yeah, whatever. Just clean up after yourself this time, will ya?
  249: Hey, everyone! Let's hear it for Billy. He's actually getting some!
  250: You need a mop?
  251: See ya in five.
  252: Sheila! Watch the bar!
  253: Hey, Billy, get outta here!
  254: Now where were we?
  255: Where are you, woman?
  256: Would you get in here?
  257: Come on, baby.
  258: Follow me.
  259: No woman stands me up. Get the hell out!
  260: Fine.
  261: I forgot; I had something else I had to attend to right away. Please forgive
    me, baby.
  262: I decided I didn't want to sleep with your ugly ass after all.
  263: Lucky for you, I'm a nice guy. Just don't pull that crap with me again.
  264: I won't, baby, I promise.
  265: I'm gonna put my foot in your ass, woman!
  266: No one talks to me like that! Die!
  267: I've given you all the chances I'm gonna give ya. Now get out.
  268: You're not going in my back room with that trash!
  300: Hey, I didn't fucking say I'd pay you to kill the bitch. Get the fuck out!
  350: Wow! Holy fuck. That was amazing.
  351: Damn, you were pretty good baby.
  352: Thanks, it was fun. Now get out.
  353: You were, uhhh... Never mind, get out.
  354: Well, I've never had worse than that.
  400: You know baby, you might be hot and all, but you've got lots and lots to learn.
  410: |-
    Baby, I do have work to do you know. I don't just stand around in this spot all day and do nothing.
     Well, okay, so what if I do? That's what I'm here to do.
dcFred:
  100: You see a citizen of the Den.
  101: You see Fred.
  102: You see Fred, wearing very fine clothes.
  150: He seems to be busy thinking about something.
  151: He seems pretty happy with his fine new threads.
  200: I'm going to make it big some day.
  201: Oh, leave me alone. I'm busy.
  202: The master plan…
  203: Going to figure it out some day…
  204: Why do I always lose?
  205: Tables must be rigged.
  206: "...I'll own my own place some day."
  207: Going to get nice clothes.
  220: Hey, man! It's late. Leave me alone.
  221: No, I don't need any company.
  222: Do you know what time it is?
  223: I don't have anything.
  224: Bug me in the morning. I'm tired.
  225: Beat it.
  226: No one's home.
  227: Can't talk. I'm getting ready for bed.
  228: Hey, lady! It's late. Leave me alone.
  240: No more money! Leave me alone.
  241: There's no work. What am I going to do?
  242: Don't tell me I owe someone else! Ahh!
  243: I'm never going to make it big now.
  244: I'm so broke.
  245: Oh man, I need some cash.
  246: I'll never get to buy new clothes now.
  247: Got to get a new master plan…
  260: Thanks for covering for me!
  261: You're a real life saver.
  262: I'll have the money for you soon.
  263: I'll win it big anytime soon!
  264: You're the first person I'll see when I win big.
  275: Master plan is in action!
  276: Thanks for the loan! You're money's in good hands!
  277: Those tables sure are rough, but don't worry.
  278: I'll win big some day, thanks to you.
  279: I'm due any day! I can feel it.
  280: I'm going to pay you back, I swear!
  281: I'm going to win it big soon. I can smell it.
  295: Huh? Do I know you? What do you want?
  296: Why do you keep bothering me? I don't even know you. Go bug someone else.
  297: I'm here to collect some money you owe someone.
  298: Never mind.
  299: Uk!
  300: Bye.
  310: HEY! There you are! I've been looking all over for you! Check out these threads!
  311: Thanks again.
  312: Looking very nice.
  313: You look like crap!
  314: Yuk!
  315: Ug.
  320: Thank you. Thank you very much! Thanks to you, I have four sets just like these!
  321: So you won it big after all?
  322: So, where's my money?
  330: You don't like my threads? You know, I think your right. I don't like them
    either. Time for some new ones - I can afford it!
  331: So, you won it big after all?
  332: Where's my money?
  333: Hmph.
  340: I was getting there! Won't even let me bask in my glory? I worked hard for
    this you know.
  341: I know, I'm sorry.
  342: Screw that. Where's the money I covered you for?
  343: I don't give a crap. Where's my money?
  350: Fine. Here. [Fred gives you $500] There's a little extra for trusting me. Well,
    see you later. Thanks again.
  351: Thanks!
  352: What ever.
  360: Thanks a lot for covering for me. It really meant a lot to me, to be trusted
    by a complete stranger. Let me give you this.
  361: Okay.
  362: You shouldn't have.
  363: Uh.
  370: I owe you a lot. You trusted me when I was down on my luck. As a small gesture
    of gratitude I have something for you.
  371: Okay.
  372: You shouldn't have.
  373: Uh.
  380: Here. [Fred give you $1000.] I hope this helps. I'm sure you'll find someplace
    to spend it.
  381: Sorry, I can't accept this.
  382: Thanks.
  383: Not really, but I'll take it.
  384: Yum.
  390: Here. [Fred gives you $2000, 5 Fusion Cells, 5 Energy Cells, and a Plasma Grenade.]
    I hope this helps, at least a little.
  391: Sorry, I can't accept this.
  392: Thank you very much.
  393: Not really, but I'll take it.
  394: Yum.
  400: What? Well, okay, if you insist. Thank you so very much. Take good care of
    yourself.
  401: Bye.
  410: What? You doing some strange chem? You don't look like a jethead. Get away
    from me you freak.
  411: Beat it!
  412: Ug.
  420: What are you talking about? I don't owe anyone anything. Who the hell are you
    talking about?
  421: Yea, you said that last time. I don't know what you're talking about? Who's
    this imaginary person again?
  422: Becky says you owe her $500
  423: Becky sent me.
  424: Rebecca says she lent you $200.
  430: Oh yeah, right. Rebecca lent me $200… Oh, wait. Maybe- ummm…
  431: She's told me to break your neck if you don't pay.
  432: Hand it over.
  440: Yeah, right. I've never seen that much money before in my life.
  441: Hmmm.
  442: Oh.
  450: Right! That'll be the day. Becky wouldn't hurt a fly. She sure is pretty though.
  451: Well, you're wrong, asshole.
  452: Maybe it was someone else.
  460: Damn. I think your right, but - I'm almost broke. I can't afford that kind
    of money! I've got to eat you know.
  461: Sorry.
  462: Tough luck.
  470: Oh, damn it. I can barely afford $100. Could you spot me half? I promise I'll
    pay you back!
  471: No sorry.
  472: Come on. Pay up the full amount!
  473: Okay, fine.
  480: Damn it. You're going to ruin me! Well, okay, here. Now I'm completely broke.
  481: Oh, fine. I'll cover you.
  482: Thanks. Manage your money better next time.
  483: Thank you for your business.
  490: I told you! I can't! I'll starve if I do. Oh, come on, can't you help me out?
  491: All right. I'll cover half of it.
  492: No sorry. I don't have the cash either.
  493: I'll be back.
  500: What? Really? Wow! Thanks a lot, man! Here's a $100. I'll get the other $100
    to you as soon as possible!
  501: What? Really? Wow! Thanks a lot, lady! Here's a $100. I'll get the other $100
    to you as soon as possible!
  502: No problem.
  503: You better pay me back.
  510: Oh, don't worry. I will! You have my word and I won't forget about it this
    time!
  511: Okay.
  520: Say, you know what? That hundred's really going to uh… delay things. Do you
    think I could borrow a little bit back?
  521: How much?
  522: No way.
  530: Wait! I know. Tell you what, I'll give you $100 and you spot me for the other
    $100 I owe Becky. I'll pay you back real soon.
  531: Okay fine.
  532: No deal.
  540: Just $50. Please! It's all part of the master plan!
  541: All right.
  542: But that'll only leave me with $50 to pay your $200 loan.
  543: No.
  550: Wha- uh… Damn! You won't regret this! I'm good for it!
  551: No problem.
  560: Uh, yeah. I see your math skills- I mean, please! It's not much to you I'm
    sure, but it's a hell of a lot for me.
  561: Okay.
  562: No.
  570: Yeah, sure she did. Everyone knows she hates that name. You're not fooling
    me!
  571: I don't owe her anything.
  572: She said you were forgetful.
  573: Look, I don't have time for this. Pay up damn it!
  574: Rebecca said she lent it to you a while ago.
  580: I am not! I… wait. There was that one time. Didn't I pay her back? I thought
    I did…
  581: No, you didn't. That's why she sent me.
  582: Just pay up so I can get out of here.
  590: I don't remember… but Becky sure has helped me and my friends out in the past.
  591: Hand over the $200.
  592: Just give me the money.
  600: Leave me alone.
  601: Whatever.
  602: Okay.
  610: Uh. Hi again. So, uh, I suppose you want the money. Do you think you could
    cover me for half?
  611: No, sorry.
  612: If she lent you $200, you'll pay it.
  613: Okay fine.
dcG1Grd:
  100: You see a guard.
  150: He's one of Tyler's guards.
  200: You still alive?
  210: We showed them, didn't we?
  211: No one messes with us.
  212: We kicked ass.
  213: About time we finished them off.
  214: I can't forget the look on his face. It was great.
  215: I'm surprised Metzger didn't get pissed.
  216: I wonder why Metzger didn't step in.
  225: I don't know why Metzger has us guard this shit.
  226: Who's going to try and steal this crap?
  227: This job is a cakewalk.
  228: No one ever messes with us.
  229: I think this stuff came from a Vault or something.
  230: What are you looking for anyway?
  231: There's nothing in here but us mice.
  232: Don't waste your time, we've checked this stuff over a million times.
  233: Tonight's the night.
  234: I hate waiting.
  235: I'll pass up drinks for this anytime.
  236: Is it time yet? I can hardly wait.
  237: I hope I get the first kill.
  238: Why did they wait until now to mess with us?
  239: This is going to be interesting.
  240: Too bad we didn't get any action after all.
  241: I wonder why they changed their minds.
  242: All that waiting and nothing.
  243: So what ever happened to that trap you were going to help us set?
  244: What happened the other night?
  245: Too bad those cowards chickened out. It would have been nice to finish them
    off.
  246: Can't believe those bastards were going to try and ambush us.
dcG2Grd:
  100: You see a gangster.
  150: He seems to be a member of Lara's gang.
  151: She seems to be a member of Lara's gang.
  200: Wise guy.
  201: There you are.
  202: Pay back.
  203: Come here.
  204: I'm not through with you.
  205: Bitch.
  225: Wonder how long things will last around here with Metzger gone?
  226: So, Metzger's finally dead?
  227: Was that your handiwork?
  228: The Den'll never be the same again.
  240: I can't believe it, we actually beat them!
  241: Metzger's got to show us respect now.
  242: We sure showed them.
  243: We gave 'em our own brand of justice.
  244: We couldn't have done it without you!
  245: Thank you for your help!
  246: We did it!
  247: You screwing around with us?
  248: Better watch you step.
  249: Lara's the only reason we don't string you up right now.
  250: What were you trying to pull?
  251: Coward.
  252: You make me sick.
  253: Get lost
  254: Beat it.
  255: We're ready when you are.
  256: It's about time we pay them back.
  257: I hate waiting.
  258: Lets go already.
  259: You ready yet?
  260: Just let Lara know when it's time.
  270: You looking to join up?
  271: You must be here to see Lara.
  272: How's it going?
  273: Lara's the person you should be talking to.
  274: Hi.
  275: You here to see Lara?
  300: Hi.
  301: How's it going?
  302: Hope things are going good.
  303: So you might be able to help us out?
  304: Good to see you.
  305: We'll pay back Tyler soon…
  306: Any new developments?
  310: Thanks for the help. To bad about Lara.
  311: We finally got em!
  312: We couldn't have done this without you.
  313: At least Lara went out in fight.
  314: I can't believe Lara didn't make it.
  315: We sure showed Metzger who's best.
  316: Metzger's better off with us.
  350: You said it!
  351: They're dead meat!
  352: We're going to kick some serious ass!
dcGamble:
  100: You see a gambler.
  101: This gambler seems to be doing extremely well.
  102: He seems to be winning, but all his money is on the table.
  103: She seems to be winning, but all her money is on the table.
  104: This person doesn't seem to be winning or losing
  105: This person hasn't won in a while.
  106: She looks like she's about to cry and seems to almost be out of money.
  107: He looks very angry and seems to be losing big.
  200: Don't hurt me!
  201: Don't shoot!
  202: I don't have any money!
  203: Why did you have to kill poor Becky?
  204: What did she ever do to you?
  205: I didn't do anything!
  206: Please go, I won't tell.
  300: Yes! The dice love me!
  301: Oh, that was close.
  302: Don't interrupt me. You'll ruin my winning streak.
  303: I'm hot!
  304: Money, money, money!
  305: I love this game!
  306: You see that! Yes!
  307: Roulette is the game to play!
  308: I'm doing pretty good, how about you?
  309: I'm doing better than normal.
  310: Great place don't you think?
  311: Becky's tables are better than New Reno.
  312: You like this game? It's a lot of fun.
  313: I haven't had a good roll in a while.
  314: I need a good roll.
  315: Well, at least I'm not losing.
  316: I'm not going anywhere.
  317: I'm just breaking even.
  318: You've got to play the numbers.
  319: Just betting on the red or black is bad odds.
  320: The dice aren't behaving.
  321: I'm down and it's not looking good.
  322: I hope you do better than I.
  323: I've seen better days.
  324: I know how to play, honest.
  325: The ball's not bouncing my way today.
  326: Another payday lost for good.
  327: I'm almost broke!
  328: Damn it. This sucks.
  329: Why is does this always happen to me?
  330: I can't win.
  331: I hate this game.
  400: Damn, Becky's was the only place to gamble around here!
  401: Stay away.
  402: Don't shoot!
  403: Please leave us lone.
  500: Don't stop there.
  501: Keep moving.
  502: COME ON 7!
  503: Yes!
  504: Keep it coming!
  505: Becky! I'm going to take all your money today!
  506: Woohoo! Winner!
  507: Give me another good bounce!
  508: Yes!
  509: All right!
  510: Again, lets see that again.
  511: Come on.
  512: That's what I wanted.
  513: Almost.
  514: Not bad.
  515: How did that happen?
  516: Oops.
  517: No wammies, no wammies. Stop!
  518: Well, the game lives up to its name.
  519: I just need one big win.
  520: Figures!
  521: Again?
  522: This isn't looking good.
  523: Roulette sucks!
  524: Becky! You're tables are killing me!
  525: Are those loaded dice or what?
  526: Not again!
  527: Why me?
  528: Damn it! So close!
  529: Oh sweet sweet Jesus, KILL ME NOW!
  530: I hate this game!
  531: Damn! That was my number on the last spin!
  532: Black again!?!?
  600: Get away!
  601: Why did you do that?
  602: Get away!
  603: Stop it, I'm fragile.
  604: I wouldn't do that do you.
dcJoey:
  100: You see a thug.
  101: You see Joey.
  150: This guy doesn't look too friendly.
  151: "[TALK]"
  152: I’m gonna cut you up, fucker!
  153: Yeah? Come on and try.
  154: Hey, wait just one minute!
  155: I’d think twice if I were you.
  156: |-
    What do you want? Why shouldn’t I just kill you rather than listen
     to your bullshit after what you've done?
  157: I want to talk to you about a ghost that comes around here at night.
  158: Did you take a locket from the haunted house?
  159: Never mind. I'll just kick your ass instead.
  160: Nothing. Just passing through.
  161: What the hell are you talking about?
  162: Did you steal a locket from that haunted house?
  163: Nothing. Never mind.
  164: Forget it. I’ll kill you now and sort out the pieces later.
  165: I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.
  166: Oh, I think you do! You stole a dead girl’s locket, and now her spirit can't
    rest.
  167: Then I’ll take it by force.
  168: T-That's f-fucking crazy! Y-you must h-have been r-really fucked up on some
    of Tubby's shit. I-I n-never s-saw no g-ghost w-when I stayed t-there- just a
    bad trip, wasn't f-fucking real.
  169: Look, I’ll buy it from you.
  170: Give it to me or you can join her.
  171: |-
    If you don’t return it now, she’ll come after you. And she can’t
     be stopped.
  172: Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. T-That's for damn sure. You're gonna have to fork over
    some bucks for sure. You ain't gettin' this for free! $50 or beat it!
  173: Okay, here’s the money.
  174: Take $20 and be happy I don’t just take it from you.
  175: Nah, I changed my mind. See ya.
  176: Give it to me or I kill you for it.
  177: Here. Now just leave me alone.
  178: Gladly.
  179: Don’t let me catch you doing this again!
  180: H-Hey! You don’t have the money! Get the hell out of here!
  181: Oops. I’ll come back.
  182: Then I guess I have to kill you.
  183: Hey. How's it goin'?
  184: OK, and you?
  185: Not so good.
  186: Did you take a locket from that haunted house?
  187: What do you know about that ghost that comes around here at night?
  188: Hey, man, I’m Joey. What're you doin' on my turf?
  189: Your turf? I don’t think so.
  190: Maybe I’m looking for you.
  191: Just leaving. Bye.
  192: Looking for some information.
  193: Hey, baby cakes. You looking for Joey? Here I am.
  194: No. Go away.
  195: Maybe. What are you offering me?
  196: I want some information.
  197: No, sorry. I have to go now.
  198: Hey, I got some jet. It’s great stuff and brand new from Reno. Want some?
  199: No way!
  200: How much?
  201: No, I want information.
  202: I have to go. Bye.
  203: How about you and I get it on?
  204: Okay.
  205: Not if you were the last nonmutated man on the planet.
  206: Er, no... I don’t think so. I need something else.
  207: You’ll be coming back.
  208: Maybe.
  209: Don’t count on it.
  210: Wait! Can I ask you something?
  211: Nobody talks to me like that!
  212: I just did. You do anything more than talk?
  213: Whatever. Are you selling anything or just making small talk?
  214: My apologies. I’m actually looking around and don’t know the area.
  215: What do you want?
  216: I’m looking for a locket.
  217: I need to know more about that haunted house.
  218: What’s the deal with the old church and those guards?
  219: Nothing you can provide.
  220: Have you heard of Vault 13?
  221: Um, never mind. See you around.
  222: Oh, you mean Tyler and his gang? They guard some shit that comes in from Vault
    City. Big fucking crates. Once in a while you see them get picked up by caravans
    heading to New Reno.
  223: Can I ask you more about them?
  224: Can I ask you something else?
  225: OK, thanks. Bye.
  226: What else you wanna know?
  227: Who’s Tyler?
  228: Where’s New Reno?
  229: So, what are they guarding?
  230: I want to ask you about something else.
  231: That’s it. Bye.
  232: |-
    Tyler's just some weasel who screwed all the rest of us out of a sweet deal with
     Metzger, but fuck that shit! I don't fucking care anymore. I could kick his fucking ass though.
     Lara and him still have some really bad blood. Something about Tyler and her brother.
  233: That could be useful. Can I ask you more about them?
  234: Can I ask you something else?
  235: OK, thanks. Bye.
  236: |-
    New Reno is down to the south a long ways, then east some. There's a lot
     of action to be made there, but it's pretty fucking dangerous too. I might head back
     some day. Here, I can show you where it's at on that fancy screen thing of yours.
  237: I think I can find it now. Can I ask you more about them?
  238: Can I ask you something else?
  239: OK, thanks. Bye.
  240: Hell if I know.
  241: Interesting. Can I ask you more about them?
  242: Can I ask you something else?
  243: OK, thanks. Bye.
  244: For you, I will sell jet for $500.
  245: No, thanks. Bye.
  246: No, thanks, but I would like to ask you something.
  247: That’s too much!
  248: OK, I’ll buy it.
  249: "If you don’t have the money, come back when you can afford it. Don't let me
    see\n you buying from anyone else or I'll kick your fucking ass. I'm the only
    one with the pure\n uncut shit, shipped directly from New Reno. "
  250: Wait, I’ll buy it.
  251: Well, can I ask you something?
  252: Bye.
  253: |-
    OK, I’ll drop the price to $350, but no less! That’s my final offer. You got to pay
     top dollar for the good shit. Don't buy from Tubby or any of those losers. They cut their
     shit. I'm the only one for miles that can get a hold of the best stuff.
  254: Forget it. Can I ask you something?
  255: OK, I’ll buy it.
  256: Never mind. Bye.
  257: |-
    Vault... Vault... Vault 13? Nope, never heard of it. Don't tell me they've come up
     with another new chem! Nothing can beat jet!
  258: No, you moron.
  259: No, it’s a place. Can I ask something else?
  260: Yes, a wonderful chem.
  261: No, bye.
  262: Joey here isn't much of a conversationalist.
  300: Probably not. Bye.
  350: You been sleeping? Turns out that Lara's a mean little bitch after all. She
    gunned Tyler down. I hear Metzger was in on it. Well, I better get back to… work.
  351: You been sleeping? Turns out that Lara was a mean little bitch after all- too
    bad she's dead. Whipped out Tyler's group. Her gang's running things over there
    now, last I heard.
dcLara:
  100: You see Lara.
  150: She's the leader of this gang.
  200: |-
    The name's Lara; I run this gang. You better not be here to cause trouble or
     you're in for a world of hurt.
  201: Hi again. Need something?
  202: Got any work?
  203: Just looking around.
  204: I'm looking for a merchant named Vic.
  205: Aruh.
  206: Rara.
  220: We don't have any doctors in town and I can't help you.
  221: Sorry, I still don't understand.
  222: Ack.
  230: The name doesn't ring a bell, but then again I don't keep track of who comes
    in and out of town. Check with Becky. Everyone ends up going through there. She
    might know.
  231: Got any work?
  232: Thanks. Bye.
  240: If you didn't come to the Den for a specific reason you should probably leave.
    It's not very safe around here.
  241: Oh, okay.
  242: Got any work?
  243: I can handle myself.
  244: Okay, thanks.
  250: No doubt. Otherwise you probably wouldn't have made it here alive.
  251: Uh, yes, so I heard. You said that already.
  252: Got any work?
  253: Okay, thanks.
  260: Well it depends on what you're good at. There is something I'm curious about.
    If you can find out, I'll pay you a bit.
  261: As I said, I'm looking for more information on a certain something… or someplace.
    I'll pay of course.
  262: Sure what's that?
  263: Maybe later.
  270: Let me know if you change your mind.
  271: All right.
  280: |-
    Well, there's a church east of here. Metzger has some people guarding whatever
     is inside. Find out what and I'll pay you $200.
  281: That was easy. I already know.
  282: Sure.
  283: I'll see what I can do.
  290: Thanks. Don't get in a fight… yet. I have a plan.
  291: No problem.
  292: I'll be right back.
  300: What's that?
  301: Raw chemical compounds in large crates.
  302: Big containers holding chemicals of some kind.
  303: Let me check again.
  310: That makes sense actually. Thanks. Here's your money.
  311: Why is that?
  312: No problem. Bye.
  320: I've seen caravan's from Vault City come in and then some of it gets picked
    up by caravans from New Reno.
  321: So? Why does that make sense?
  322: Oh.
  340: New Reno is the chem capital around here. They have to get the raw materials
    to make there chems from somewhere, right? It seems like they're getting some,
    or all of it, from Vault City.
  341: Where's New Reno?
  342: Okay, thanks.
  350: Not sure exactly. Some where to the south I think. I've never been there, I
    just see their caravans stop buy once in a while - once in a long while.
  351: Oh, okay. Thanks.
  360: You looking for some more quick and easy cash? $50. Easy money.
  361: Sure.
  362: Make it quick.
  370: I need you to check with Metzger to see if he'd be okay if Tyler and I settled
    some old maters. He'll understand what I mean.
  371: Why do you want me to ask?
  372: If I get a chance
  373: Okay.
  380: Because I don't want Tyler to see any of my people going into or out of Metzger's
    place. I don't want to tip our hand.
  381: Don't you get it. If Tyler sees me all of a sudden talking to Metzger he might
    catch wind of something fishy.
  382: We'll see.
  383: Okay.
  390: So did you find out what's in there?
  391: Raw chemical compounds in large crates.
  392: Big containers holding chemicals of some kind.
  393: Not yet.
  400: So did you talk to him yet? What did he say?
  401: He said yes. If you win, you can have their job, like before.
  402: Na.
  410: Great. I was hoping as much. I hear he's been complaining about them lately.
    Here's your money.
  411: I assume there's something else now?
  412: Thanks. Bye.
  420: I have one more job for you. I'm not sure how you'll do it, but since you were
    able to get inside maybe they trust you.
  421: I snuck inside.
  422: What is it?
  430: I'm sure you can figure something out.
  431: Okay, what is it?
  440: |-
    We can't take them at their present strength. They have extra funding
     and slightly out number us. If you can find some kind of weakness we could use
     to balance out the odds or something we can exploit...
  441: Huh? Find a weakness? How am I supposed to do that?
  442: How much?
  443: Consider it done.
  450: We'll give you $150. There's no way we can get close enough to find out by
    ourselves.
  451: If I get around to it.
  452: Okay.
  460: I don't know. That's why I'm asking you to help.
  461: I'll try.
  462: This is pointless.
  470: Did you find anything?
  471: Yes. They're having a party tonight.
  472: Not yet. I'll let you know.
  473: Gra.
  474: Na.
  480: |-
    Excellent! They're sure to leave a skeleton crew. Those should be good
     odds. We'll take out those at the party after we hit the church.
  481: And my money?
  490: |-
    I don't think so. You'll have to come with us if you want your money. You
     won't have to fight but just to be sure it's not a trap. We'll give you $300 total.
  491: You ready?
  492: Okay, let's do it.
  493: Give me a bit to get ready.
  494: No way. Keep your money!
  500: Okay, but we've got to act soon so don't take to long or we'll ruin our chance.
  501: Okay.
  510: You don't have to fight. Easy money.
  511: Well, have you changed your mind?
  512: Let's go. I'm ready.
  513: Okay, I'll be right back.
  514: No.
  515: Uk
  520: Because of you we blew our chance.
  521: Coward!
  522: You get nothing.
  523: It was probably a trap anyhow.
  524: Sorry, you're not reliable.
  525: I can't trust you.
  530: We did it!
  531: Thank you for your help.
  532: Special thanks to you!
  533: I've finally paid Tyler back for what he did to my brother.
  534: Thank you again.
  540: Now that's Metzger's dead, I don't know what'll happen.
  541: Maybe we should just pack up.
  542: Did you hear Metzger died? I don't know what to do now.
  543: What's going to happen to the Den now? Maybe something better.
  544: This could actually be for the better.
  550: Bastard!
  551: Bitch!
  560: Thanks. Here's your money and $100 extra.
  570: Did you kill Tyler and his guards? How are we supposed to prove ourselves to
    Metzger? He'll never hire us now. That was our only chance.
  571: We don't have any work. Someone killed off Metzger's guards and now he won't
    talk to us. He thinks we did it. Oh well.
  572: Sorry.
  573: Too bad.
  574: That was me, and you're next.
  575: Oh. Okay, bye.
  576: Uhr?
  577: Ug.
  590: I told you we would go together. Since no one was there to watch the place,
    it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.
  591: I told you to find a weakness, not kill them! Since no one was there to watch
    the place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.
  592: Damn it! I told you to ask Metzger not to kill them! Since no one was there
    to watch the place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.
  593: Damn it! I told you not to attack them! Since no one was there to watch the
    place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.
  594: Oh, well, I've got to go.
  595: That's a shame.
  596: You're next, bitch.
  597: Hmph!
  598: You next.
  610: You really know how to screw things up, don't you?
  611: We don't need any more of your help.
  612: Go bother someone else.
  613: Metzger better not take anything out on us.
  614: I'm sorry. I can't help you.
  615: Can't talk. I'm trying to figure out what to do now.
  616: I hope Metzger doesn't think we were involved.
  617: What are we going to do now?
  618: We better leave soon in case Metzger thinks we killed his guards.
  619: You ever been to New Reno? Maybe we'll head there - or north.
  650: Alright! Let's go! Everyone follow me!
dcMaggie:
  100: You see the owner of the saloon.
  101: You see Becky.
  150: This looks like the owner.
  151: This is Becky, owner of this place.
  152: "[TALK]"
  153: Hello, stranger, and welcome to my saloon. I’m Becky.
  154: 'Hello, I am '
  155: ". What’s there to do around here?"
  156: 'Hi, I’m '
  157: ". Can I ask some questions?"
  158: Mom?
  159: Mag gah.
  160: Run along. I don’t need your kind here.
  161: Mmmm...
  162: Screw you.
  163: I’m going.
  164: Sorry, no offense was meant. Can I ask something?
  165: Drink of whiskey is $5 and the gambling tables are right over there. Have a
    good one.
  166: Can I ask a question?
  167: I want a drink!
  168: Hmm, those are some cheap drinks. Let’s see one.
  169: Thanks. Bye.
  170: Vault 13? Nope, never heard of it.
  171: Hmm, can I ask something else?
  172: Damn, I need to find it. Bye.
  173: What would you like to know?
  174: Where’s a good place to eat?
  175: Do you know where Vault 13 is?
  176: Why are your drinks so cheap?
  177: Nothing. Bye.
  178: Mom runs a little restaurant across town.
  179: Mommy! Mommy!
  180: One more question.
  181: Thanks. Bye.
  182: Beat it.
  183: Gwah.
  184: I’ll give you something to beat.
  185: Quick question first?
  186: Bye.
  187: A shot of whiskey is $5. Pay first.
  188: Huh?
  189: Here’s the money.
  190: Changed my mind.
  191: I’m a little short of cash. Can I have a tab?
  192: Can I ask a question?
  193: Gotta go.
  194: Here’s the drink. Anything else?
  195: Question?
  196: Yeha, how about you and I...
  197: Nope.
  198: Hey, you don’t enough cash for this drink. You’re poorer than even these sops!
  199: Sorry.
  200: Hmm, I’ll come back.
  201: |-
    Hmm. Let me get someone to watch the bar. You and I can go into the back room and play a little
     game I call "First Strike." If you’re good, well, there’s "Ground Zero."
  202: OK!
  203: Er...uh...I have to go.
  205: You were OK.
  206: Next time, let’s play "Into the Glow." But for now...
  207: Can you do something for me?
  208: I have to go, but I’ll come back.
  209: What can I do for you, sweet cheeks?
  210: I need some more lovin’.
  211: I got some questions.
  212: How can you sell your drinks so cheaply?
  213: How about a drink?
  214: Gotta run. See ya.
  215: Not now. Maybe later. Yes, definitely later.
  216: Can I ask a question?
  217: Later then.
  218: |-
    I have a still in the basement. I made it myself. Beats paying triple to those New Reno
     gangsters.
  219: Smart girl! I like that!
  220: Hmm, I have to go. I’ll see you later.
  221: Why? Why did you destroy my still? You bastard!
  222: Nothing personal. I got paid to do it.
  223: I’m sorry.
  224: Bye.
  225: I’ll just make another one, you know.
  226: I know.
  227: Well, that’s good.
  228: Bye.
  232: Why? Why did you destroy my still? You bitch!
  233: Where are you, baby?
  234: Are you coming?
  235: I'm waiting.
  236: I'm in here, lover.
  237: I've got a bar to run.
  238: Follow me, sugar.
  240: How did you... Do that... Uhhh...
  241: It's O.K., size doesn't really matter.
  242: That was, ummm, nice -- I guess.
  243: Thanks, sweety; that was fun.
dcMarc:
  100: You see a guard.
  101: You see Marc, a guard.
  102: You see Marc, one of Tyler's guards.
  150: Yo, Tyler!
  200: What the…?
  225: I knew we could take those pussies.
  226: Thanks for the tip. That was some fun stuff.
  227: Too bad we killed them all. Now what are we to do?
  228: Are we hot or what?
  229: We're too good.
  230: We fucking kicked some ass! Fuck yeah!
  250: Tyler's the one to talk to, not me, lady.
  251: What's up. You need something, you gotta talk to Tyler here.
  252: What you looking at?
  253: Tyler's the one to talk to, not me, man.
  255: We're going to kick some ass tonight!
  256: Tonight's the night!
  257: I'm going to remember this night for sure.
  258: Don't even tell me they chickened out.
  259: Oh, I sure hope those fuckers show.
  260: I knew those pussies wouldn't show.
  261: We should just go kick their asses just for thinking about fighting us.
  262: We would have ripped through them if they had showed.
  263: I could have taken them on by myself.
  264: Tyler and I would have kicked some serious ass.
dcMetRom:
  100: You see a tough middle-aged slaver.
  101: You see a rather large slaver.
  150: There's a slaver who seems to enjoy his work.
  151: This slaver seems to be very strong but not to bright.
  200: Get the hell away from the door.
  201: What the fuck do you think your doing?
  202: Metzger'll have your head. Back off man.
  203: Hey, bitch, get away from that door.
  204: No bitch is going in Metzger's room. Back off.
  205: Back off, bitch. Slaver or not, Metzger's room is off limits.
  250: Talk to Metzger, not me, buddy.
  251: You going to join the guild?
  252: There's good money if you're in the guild.
  253: You'll get a lot of action if you're in the guild.
  254: Talk to Metzger, not me, lady.
  255: Metzger's not going to hire a bitch so beat it.
  256: Beat it.
  257: Hey, man.
  258: You're lucky you only have to go on the runs.
  259: Being a door guard's a boring life.
  260: How's it going?
  261: You're the first woman Metzger's ever hired.
  262: Metzger must have a soft spot for you.
  263: You're all alone little lady.
  264: A woman slaver… Never thought I would see it.
dcMetzge:
  100: You see a mean looking man.
  101: You see Metzger, the slaver master.
  150: Metzger's the head of the Slaver's Guild.
  200: You'll pay for that.
  210: |-
    What the fuck do you want? This is the Slaver's Guild not some safe
     house for you fucking jet heads.
  211: |-
    What the hell do you want, you ugly bitch? This is the Slaver's
     Guild not some fucking whorehouse.
  212: |-
    What the hell do you want, bitch? This is the Slaver's Guild not some
     fucking whorehouse.
  213: You're starting to piss me off. What the hell do you want now?
  214: Now what, damn it?
  215: What?
  216: Oh, you better make it quick.
  217: You here to work for a fucking change?
  218: I'm starting to get used to your ugly mug. So... are you here for a reason
    or what?
  219: |-
    Do I look like your fucking dad or something? I sure as hell hope not. Now spit it
     out, what do you want?
  220: |-
    Oh, look who's here. You think you're special or something? Speak up or get the
     fuck out.
  221: What do you want now, slaver?
  222: You just going to stand there or are you going to say something?
  223: Speak up. I don't have all day for this crap.
  230: Oh, and 'who' would that be? I hope you don't plan on seeing this person again...
  231: |-
    You don't have anyone that I'm interested in. I'm only interested in people -
     normal ones, that is.
  232: |-
    You fucking moron, what do you think I am, a fucking store or something? If you get
     a slave you'd like to sell, let me know. If you want to sell something else, go to a fucking store.

  234: Davin
  235: Vic
  236: Myron
  237: MacRae
  238: Sulik
  239: Can I ask you another question instead?
  240: I changed my mind. Bye.
  245: Go ahead.
  246: Yeah?
  247: I'm not your fucking servant, so hurry it up.
  248: What is it? I don't have all day.
  249: Shoot.
  250: Maybe.
  255: I have something I'd like to sell.
  256: About Vic…
  257: I'm looking for a merchant.
  258: Lara wanted me to ask you for permission to fight Tyler.
  259: Can I join the guild?
  260: What can you tell me about your guild?
  261: I'd like to go on a slave run.
  262: Never mind. Bye.
  263: " want to ill."
  264: Na.
  270: |-
    You think you can cut it? I don't take in just anyone... What the hell. If
     you fuck up, I'll sell you off. You'll have to get a tattoo on your forehead
     identifying you as a slaver to everyone. It's permanent, so no second thoughts.
  271: |-
    So, our delicate little flower girl returns… You changed your mind then?
     Going to get that tat after all?
  272: |-
    Yeah, you might do... You don't need much in the way of brains to go on a run.
     If you fuck up, I'll just sell you off. If you think you can cut it you'll have
     to get a tattoo on your forehead identifying you to everyone as slaver.
  273: Let's do it.
  274: I have to think about it. I'll get back to you.
  275: Maybe not. Bye.
  276: Uya! [nod]
  277: No no no no no!
  285: What do you fucking think? This is a slaving guild. I buy and sell slaves.
  286: Where do you get the slaves?
  287: I'd like to join.
  288: Another question please.
  289: Oh, okay. Bye.
  300: Oh, here and there. We mainly collect primitives and nomads when we run across
    them.
  301: Sounds like fun. How can I get in on that?
  302: I have another question.
  303: Oh, okay. Bye.
  310: |-
    What do you know, you didn't even cry. I'm so proud of you... actually, that tat
     looks pretty good on you. Just give a holler when you're ready for your first slave run.
  311: Thanks. Bye.
  312: I'm ready right now.
  313: Me Kill NOW!
  314: Okey-Dokey
  320: |-
    Two of my men will get you fairly close to your targets. Your pay will be based
     on the number of the slaves you return, but watch each other's backs. If anyone
     gets killed, your pay will be severely cut.
  321: |-
    Damn, we're all farmed out. Have to wait for some primitives to move back into the
     area. Maybe we should start breeding them.
  322: |-
    Sorry, you're just not working out. Too many losses and this is a business. I need
     to make money, not lose it.
  323: All right. They're ready.
  324: Good, you can leave now.
  325: Get a move on it then.
  326: Good. See me when you're done.
  327: Okay.
  328: Uh.
  340: |-
    Just kill all the hostile ones. If they attack you, kill them. I don't
     want to deal with them anymore, too big of a fucking hassle. Once you're done,
     the other slavers will round up and tag the rest.
  341: Okay.
  342: Oh.
  350: |-
    Once they start tagging the slaves, you can head back if you like. It takes
     special training, so don't try to subdue the others yourself. You can do whatever
     you want just as long as you don't damage the goods.
  351: All right.
  352: Uh huh.
  360: Ah, yeah. She's pretty nice. I'll give you $
  1360: " for her. How about it?"
  361: He's okay. I could probably take him off your hands for, oh, say $
  1361: "?"
  362: |-
    You fucking idiot. What the hell makes you think I want that moron back? It took
     him forever to fix a damn radio! A radio! You're stuck with him. I don't want him
     breaking anything else around here.
  363: I don't know this one's pretty skinny... but a smart one? That might be worth
    something. I'll give you $
  1363: "."
  364: This one looks like he could really put up a fight. Hmm… $
  1364: "."
  365: Another primitive. This one's a freak show. Still, he looks strong and that
    look might fetch something extra. $
  1365: "?"
  366: How about someone else?
  367: Well, let me ask you another question then
  368: Okay.
  369: Fine.
  370: Okay.
  371: Not worth it.
  372: No.
  380: All right, boys, put him in the pens.
  381: All right, boys, put her in the pens.
  382: Right, boss.
  390: |-
    Well don't waste my fucking time then. If you ever get something you're
     looking to part with, come see me.
  391: I've got another question for you.
  392: Okay. Bye.
  400: |-
    What the hell crawled up her ass all of a sudden? I gave that bitch a chance
     a while back. Didn't think she had the balls to try this.
  401: What are you talking about?
  402: So it's okay?
  410: |-
    Oh, don't play coy with me. I know exactly what she's planning to do. I
     gave her a chance a while back and she couldn't cut it, but if she
     thinks she's up to it...
  411: So, it's okay?
  420: |-
    Well, I did say the offer would remain open. If she finally thinks she can kick his ass and
     is better able to guard my shit...
  421: Well?
  422: So, that's a yes?
  430: |-
    Look, I don't give a shit which of them guards it. Just as long as none of my goods are
     damaged, I don't care.
  431: Another question, please.
  432: Okay, thanks.
  440: |-
    What the fuck are you asking me for? Do I look like some kind of fucking… oh,
     wait. You're probably looking for Vic?
  441: |-
    He's the one that 'specializes' in vault technology, or so he says. He's my
     property now. He's not going anywhere.
  442: What about him?
  443: Yeah, that's him.
  444: Can I see him?
  445: Why are you keeping him here?
  446: Okay, thanks. Bye.
  455: |-
    That little fuck - he sold me a radio that he said would be able to pick up
     some transmissions. It didn't. I caught his ass trying to sneak out of town before
     I found out. Bad mistake. No one fucks with me. He's lucky to be alive.
  456: Like I said. He needs to fix something first. After that we'll see.
  457: |-
    Well he's finally gotten that damn radio to work, but it doesn't mean I'm going to let
     him off that easy.
  458: He still tried to screw me over.
  459: Can I see him?
  460: What kind transmissions are you talking about?
  461: Okay, thanks.
  462: Maybe some money might help clear things up?
  463: What kind transmissions were you talking about before?
  475: |-
    What for? Ah, fuck, never mind. Just don't keep him from fixing that damn
     radio - and he better fix it soon. I'm sick of feeding his lazy ass.
  476: Why are you keeping him here?
  477: Thanks.
  485: The Enclave and New… hey. What the hell you care for? It's business. I need
    to be sure no one's trying to fuck me over. That's all you need to know.
  486: Mind your own business.
  487: Okay.
  495: Sure, but it'll cost you $
  496: "$"
  1496: "."
  497: Can't we work something out?
  498: Okay. Here.
  499: Can I ask you some more questions first.
  500: Sorry, can't afford that yet.
  510: |-
    Okay, he's yours, but get his ass out of here before I change my mind
     and put a bullet in that stupid fucking head of his.
  511: Can I ask you some more questions first?
  512: Thank you.
  520: |-
    Oh, yes. We can work everything out nice and smooth... I'll give you
     half off if you make it worth my while...
  521: You had best stop teasing me, girly. I'm not much with patience.
  522: Only if you're good to me.
  523: Sure, why not.
  524: Maybe later.
  530: Oh, you better believe it.
  531: Good.
  540: Here's $
  1540: ". Pretty fucking good job ."
  2540: "."
  541: Here's your $
  1541: ". You kicked some serious ass. Keep it up."
  542: Good job out there. Here's $.
  1542: "."
  543: Here's your money .
  1543: ", $."
  2543: "."
  544: "$."
  1544: " isn't something to laugh at but you can't make a lot more than that."
  545: Well it's $
  1545: " this time. Pretty good job."
  546: It wasn't that tough, now was it? Next time no mistakes. Here's $.
  1546: "."
  547: "$"
  1547: "? Not bad."
  548: Come on! $.
  1548: "? You can do better than that."
  549: Remember, watch each other's backs and only kill the hostile slaves. Here's
    $.
  1549: "."
  550: Only $.
  1550: "! That's fucking pitiful! Shape up or I'll kick your ass out."
  551: |-
    You want to make any money or not? You're pissing me off. How fucking
     hard can it be? Now take your $.
  1551: " and get out."
  552: |-
    What the hell was your problem? You don't earn shit this time. We're
     in this to make money, not dick around.
  553: I'll do better next time.
  554: Thanks for nothing.
  555: Thanks
  556: Ug.
  570: Damn bitch, was that your first time? There's no way that was not your first
    time.
  571: Damn girl, was that your first time?
  572: Pretty good, I guess.
  573: Very nice, maybe we can do it again sometime.
  574: Damn! That was... very well spent money.
  575: Damn! You were the best piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had a lot.
  600: YOU STUPID FUCK! How dare you abandon your fellow slavers out there. [Spits
    in your face] KILL HIM!
  601: But I...
  602: Alright, let's do this.
  620: Well, nice to see you could make it back.
  621: Yeah, it was a tough run.
  622: Thanks. Things got a little harry out there.
  623: Agra Moo ne!
  630: Oh, you want money? You want to be paid?
  631: Yah.
  632: Ugh.
  640: Of course I'd LOVE to help you out but… there's this slight problem I have…
    something about attacking one of my men.
  641: Sorry! I didn't mean to- I mean… Ug?
  642: Uh, oh.
  650: Oh, don't worry. I'm sure I can find it in my heart to pay- I mean repay you.
    Men, it's payday.
  651: |-
    Oh, don't worry. I'm sure I can find it in my heart to pay- I mean repay you. Men,
     take this bitch down.
  652: Oops.
  653: Garaka!
  654: Uh… Tank?
  670: Oh, I'm sure. This line of work isn't to be take lightly. It takes trust and
    loyalty. We watch each other's backs. Good policy don't you think?
  671: I guess.
  672: Uh, what's going on?
  673: Definitely.
  680: |-
    You guess? I didn't think you were that smart. You really are a stupid fuck.
     [Metzger glares at you then looks to his guards and motions in your direction.]
  681: Actions?
  682: What?
  690: Oh, so you aren't as dumb as you act. Well, that's a shame. You see, I'm having
    a bit of a dilemma. Someone had the nerve to attack my men.
  691: Really?
  692: It was an accident!
  700: Really? I'm so glad you agree. Now what would you do if someone betrayed this
    trust?
  701: Uh, give them a warning?
  702: Here. Let me show you. [attack]
  703: Make them pay.
  710: You think so? Honestly? I don't know. I was thinking of something a little
    more… permanent. [With an evil grin, Metzger looks to his guards and nods.]
  711: What?
  712: Oh boy…
  720: I'm glad we're in agreement. [Metzger looks to his guards.] Men, it's payday.
  721: Uh…
  730: |-
    Yes. It's a shame really. This person just doesn't seem to get it, but
     I think they are about to. [You see Metzger making a small hand gesture to his
     men.] Play time.
  731: Oh really?
  732: Uh oh.
  740: Yes, I'm afraid accidents happen around here quite often. In fact, I'm afraid
    we're about to have another one. [Metzger smiles pleasantly and then nods towards
    his men.]
  741: Bring it on!
  742: I'm not getting out of this am I?
  750: Oh, but this will be fun. Trust me.
  751: Fuck you.
  752: Uh, okay.
  800: You've killed the leader of the Slave Guild.
dcMom:
  100: You see a kindly-looking older woman.
  150: You see Mom, busily cooking and cleaning.
  151: You see a robust older woman, with a cheerful smile on her face.
  200: Hello there, I'm Mom. I haven't seen you around here before.
  201: Hello again. What can Mom do for you?
  202: Me .
  203: Mmmm. Ook? Bye bye Mommy.
  220: You already half-ate me out of house and home. Why dontcha find someplace else
    to hang out for a while? You've eaten here enough today.
  221: Well.
  222: " you sure do look as though you're a might confused. I hate to see a critter
    suffer. Want something to eat?"
  223: Me full. Mom food good. Bye Mom.
  224: Me pay?
  225: Me go. Bye Mom.
  240: Well, OK. Whatcha got? (Mom reaches for your purse)
  241: Mom? (you hold out your purse)
  242: No! Me go. Bye Mommy.
  250: No, not really. I'm sorry. We just have rat-pie, rat-loaf, and spaghetti.
  251: What'll it be this time around?
  252: Uh, could I get something without so much rat in it?
  253: I guess I'll have the rat-loaf.
  254: I guess I'll have the rat-pie.
  270: You could have the spaghetti. It doesn't have too much rat in it - just the
    sauce, that's all.
  271: Well, OK, I guess I'll have the spaghetti with rat-sauce.
  280: I'll get you a nice helping right away. That'll be $10.
  281: I don't have enough money right now. Let me ask you a question instead.
  282: "$10 for rat? You've got to be crazy. Heck, around the village we charge much
    more for a nice juicy one. That's a deal."
  283: Well, OK. Here's your money.
  284: I think I've changed my mind. Let me ask you a question instead.
  285: I think I'll come back later. Goodbye.
  300: You have quite an appetite there. I love to see a healthy eater. Will that
    do it for you?
  301: Not a chance, Mom. I want seconds.
  302: Sure will. Let me ask you something, Mom.
  303: That's it for now. Goodbye, Mom.
  320: Well, I sure need someone to deliver a meal to Smitty. He's just west of here
    at the junkyard. Will you do it for me? I'll give you a free meal if you do.
  321: Sure, I don't mind.
  322: Let me think about it. In the meantime, let me ask you about something else.
  323: Uh, sorry, Mom. I can't. Goodbye.
  340: You're in luck. We're having radscorpion stew.
  341: We're having braised pig-rat.
  342: We're serving steamed radscorpion tails in drawn butter.
  343: Cabbage soup is all I've got right now.
  344: Fresh brahmin fries!
  345: Pipin' hot gecko pie, comin' up.
  346: Flank steak.
  347: Well-marbled molerat.
  348: Fricasseed floater.
  349: Filet mignon.
  350: Medallions of grilled gecko.
  351: Mantis marsala.
  352: Molerat manicotti.
  353: Brahmin en brochette.
  354: Radscorpion en croute.
  356: Uh, I'm not sure, but it tastes like chicken.
  357: Centaur chops, my specialty.
  358: It's a surprise.
  359: It's Smeat!
  360: Really?
  375: Here you go. You look half-starved. (Mom hands you a big steaming plate of
    delicious smelling food.)
  376: Tank-u, Mom.
  385: There you go. I knew you'd enjoy that.
  386: Mmm, yum yum. Bye, Mom.
  395: Thanks so much. I'd do it myself but there's nobody to watch the place while
    I'm gone. Here's Smitty's meal. If I didn't have it brought to him I'm sure he'd
    forget to eat.
  396: I'll bring it right over to him.
  405: I'm so disappointed in you. Poor Smitty had to come get his own meal. Now what
    do you want?
  406: Hello there, my name's Mom and I run this place. Got the best food north of
    New Reno, too.
  407: What did you want to talk to Mom about?
  408: You're not my mom.
  409: Have you heard of a Vault or anyone named Vic?
  410: What's there to do here in town?
  411: What do you have to eat here?
  425: I know that. But everyone calls me that. Heck, I even treat people like they're
    my kin - long as you obey my rules that is.
  426: Rules?
  435: That's right. No stealing, no cursing, and no fighting - not in my shop you
    don't. 'Cause if'n you do, out you'll go. I like things peaceful here.
  436: I see. Let me ask you something else.
  437: That makes sense. See you later, Mom.
  445: Well now, there's a Vault City a ways east of here and a little north. And
    Vic, hmm, lemme think.
  446: I sure hope you know where Vic is. He's a trader.
  447: Thanks but that's all I need to know. Bye, Mom.
  455: Trader Vic? Now that rings a bell. Yes, I think he's being held by Metzger
    for some reason.
  456: Who's Metzger and where do I find him?
  457: That's great, Mom. Thanks.
  465: Metzger's the head of the local Slaver's Guild. He's got all kinds of people
    locked up in his place. It's right up the street, just north of here.
  466: Metzger used to be the head of the local Slaver's Guild. He had all kinds of
    people locked up in his place. But I don't know now - I heard he's been killed.
  467: Thanks for the information. Let me ask you something else, Mom.
  468: I need to go take care of some business. Thanks, Mom.
  475: Go on and get that meal to Smitty now.
  476: I won't help you out until you keep your word.
  477: Hurry up now.
  478: Go give Smitty his meal. Hurry up.
  479: Stop your lollygaging and get that meal to Smitty.
  485: |-
    That was good work. You must have worked up quite an appetite.
     I have a real treat for you as a reward. A combination plate of the best
     darn food I have here, just for you.
  486: That sounds great! Let me at it!
  487: Gee, Mom. I don't think I can eat just now, but thanks anyhow. Goodbye.
  500: |-
    Hmm, don't know much about that. Someone's probably just having
     a little fun, that's all.
  501: Has it always been haunted?
  502: Does anyone use that house?
  503: I agree. Bye.
  520: |-
    Started about 2 years back. I heard about the moaning and the spirits and all.
     Don't believe it myself.
  521: Two years, huh? Anybody use the place back then?
  522: Me neither. Thanks.
  540: One of the boys used to sleep there a few years back. Maybe he knows something.
  541: Who?
  542: Probably not. Bye.
  560: |-
    He used to come by and try to pawn stuff. Jewelry mostly. I remember
     a little gold locket he kept for himself.
  561: Do you remember his name?
  562: Locket? Strange. Who was it?
  563: Let me ask you something else.
  564: Thanks, bye.
  580: |-
    Not sure. Think it was Joseph, Joel or something like that. He's almost 19
     now.... A shame, really. I believe he's joined up with some local thugs.
  581: Thanks. I have another question for you.
  582: Thanks, bye.
  600: What do you know about that haunted house?
dcPenGrd:
  100: You see a slaver.
  150: He seems to be very alert.
  200: Touch that again and you'll loose a limb.
  201: That's it!
  210: Nothing but the slaves are back there.
  211: The slaves don't get visitors.
  212: Only guild members through this door.
  213: You lookin' for a slave? Talk to Metzger.
  214: Talk to Metzger. Slave pens are off limits.
  215: What are you wandering around here for? Beat it.
  216: Beat it, bitch. Slaves get no visitors.
  230: How's it going, buddy?
  231: Little slow today.
  232: Hope you're liking the guild.
  233: Your tat came out well.
  234: Did you go on that last run?
  235: Hi.
  236: You're my kind of lady.
  237: A female slaver - got to respect that.
  238: Hi there.
  239: Looking good.
dcPetey:
  100: You see a chem reliant.
  101: You see Petey.
  150: This here is a poor chem reliant.
  151: Petey here looks like he could use some help.
  152: "[talk]"
  155: "[cough, cough] Any spare change for Petey?"
  156: Sure, here ya go.
  157: No, get away from me.
  158: Peewee?
  159: You're worse off than me. [cough] Thanks anyway.
  160: Sorry; bye.
  161: Duh, you are welcome, uh-huh, yeah.
  162: Maybe next time. Thank you anyway. [cough]
  163: "[done]"
  164: Thank you so much. [cough] So, so, so very much.
  165: You’re welcome.
  166: Yeah, yeah.
  167: Sir, [cough] can you help a poor man down on his luck?
  168: Here’s $5.
  169: Not today.
  170: Get a job.
  171: Kind lady, please help [cough] a poor, starving man who is [cough] too sick
    to work.
  172: You poor thing, here’s $5.
  173: I make a point of not giving money to panhandlers.
  174: No.
  200: Hey, man; give me some money?
  201: Spare some change, kind sir?
  202: Hey, can you help me with a few bucks?
  203: Do you think you can help me out with a coupla dollars?
  204: Do you think you could lend me a few bucks?
  205: Spare some change, kind lady?
  206: Hey, lady; spare some money?
  220: Please help me, sir.
  221: Ahhh, it hurts.
  222: I need help. It hurts bad.
  223: Lady, can you get me some help?

  150: You see Rebecca, the owner of Becky's Casino Bar.

    Hi there, I'm Rebecca. Can I get you something to drink? I'm sure you're thirsty
     after your trip through the wastes.

  218: Nice to see you again. How can I help you today?
  219: What?

  223: What can I do for you? I'm really busy.
  224: You here for a drink? The tables are over there.
  225: I'm really not in the mood. What now?

  240: Sure, handsome.
  241: What would you like to know?

  247: Of course, don't be silly.
  248: Anything. Now what was it?
  249: I'll do my best to help you out. What did you need to know?
  250: Ask away.
  251: If you insist.
  252: I guess so.
  253: Let's keep it short. I have a business to run.
  254: Well, okay. What is it?
  255: I suppose.
  256: What?
  257: No, sorry.
  258: Not right now.
  270: I need a drink.
  271: I'm looking for a merchant who sells Vault equipment.
  272: I'm looking for a merchant named Vic.

  275: Any more work for me?

    Whiskey is my specialty. It's almost a tradition in the Dyer family. I charge the
     low, low price of only $5.
  301: Drinks are still $5, and the Dyer family makes the best darn drinks in the
    whole world.
  302: You okay? You want whiskey? Only $5.
  303: I'll take a drink.
  304: Why are your drinks so cheap?
  305: Dyer?
  306: Can I ask a question?
  307: Bye.
  308: Wekee
  309: Urka.
  320: |-
    Oh, that's the family name. The name Dyer has been in the bar business for a
     long time - prewar times, of course.
  321: |-
    As I said, it's my family name. There used to be Dyer pubs, saloons or something,
     all over the world.
  322: I'll take a drink.
  323: Can I ask another question?
  324: Bye.
  330: |-
    Well, since you're such a good customer, I'll let you in on a little secret.
     It's simple really - I have a still. A friend from a nearby town taught me how to
     make one. So, would you like another one?
  331: |-
    Sorry, it's a trade secret. Plus, I don't really know you that well. I wouldn't
     want Frankie finding out. He's enough trouble as it is.  Did you still want one? They
     really hit the spot.
  332: Sure. I'll have one.
  333: Can I ask another question?
  334: Okay, thanks.
  340: There you are. Thank you very much.
  341: Thanks. Can I ask you a question?
  342: Okay, thanks.
  343: Thankey youey.
  344: Nopey nopey.
  350: Sorry. I don't think so.
  351: Fred owes me $200. If you can collect it somehow, we'll work something out.
  352: I still have that debt I need collected.
  353: |-
    Derek borrowed a book of mine a while back. I'll pay $80 if you can get it
     back for me.
  354: I'm still looking for that book of mine.
  355: What's the catch?
  356: Tell me more.
  357: Can I ask you a question?
  358: Bye.
  370: |-
    Catch? Oh, well, if you knew Fred you'd understand. He's owed me the money
     for quite a long time. I'd written it off as a loss, but if you can get it back, I'd be
     amazed… and grateful. He's somewhere in town, I'm sure.
  371: The book was The Lavender Flower. Derek should be over around Mom's on the
    east side.
  372: I'll see what I can do.
  373: Sure sounds easy.
  374: I already found it.
  375: I'll have to get back to you.
  385: You didn't really get it did you? I'd be amazed.
  386: Oh, did you find my book? Derek better not have messed it up.
  387: Yes, I did.
  388: I'm sorry. He's dead.
  389: Sorry, but Derek's also dead.
  390: I'm sorry, but he's dead.
  391: Yes. Here it is.
  392: No, sorry.
  400: |-
    I can't believe it. How did you do it? Oh, never mind. I'm just stunned,
     that's all. To show my appreciation, I'll split it with you, right down the
     middle. Thank you again, that was very honest of you.
  401: Oh, I'm so glad you were able to find it… Thank you very much. Here's your
    money.
  402: You're welcome.
  410: |-
    I can't believe they are both dead. I'm sorry. Thank you for finding out for
     me. If you'll excuse me…
  411: I can't believe he's dead… after all these years.
  412: Sure.
  420: Yeah, I know who that is. That's Vic - the guy Metzger has locked up.
  421: Yeah, I know Vic. Metzger's got him locked up. I'm not sure why though.
  422: Who's Metzger?
  423: I have another question.
  424: Great! Bye.
  430: |-
    You came to the Den and you don't know who Metzger is? He's the slave master.
     He's on the east side of town. Hard to miss.
  431: I have another question.
  432: Thanks.
  440: Murderer!
  441: Childkiller!
  442: Please leave.
  443: I won't deal with the likes of you.
  444: I'm not going down without a fight!
  450: Buffy! It's you! How are you? It's been a long time!
  451: Huh?
  452: Huh?
  460: Dave sends his best and wishes he could be here to say hi, but he had to run
    off.
  461: Where to?
  470: |-
    Something about a commando… or that he was going after a commando. Not sure
     exactly. Something like that.
  471: Oh.
  480: |-
    Oh, he said to give you this. It's a present from the Hendee family. It should
     help you out some.
  481: What is it?
  490: |-
    Oh, just a few trinkets. Here you go. [Becky hands you $1000, 5 Stimpaks,
     Metal Armor, an Uzi, 5 clips of ammo, a Plasma Grenade, and flower]
  491: Thanks!
  500: No problem. I was just holding them for you. Well, I better get back to work.
  501: Thanks, bye.
  510: |-
    Didn't you hear! He's dead! Oh, I know I shouldn't be happy, but he was a very
     evil man.
  511: He sure put up a good fight.
  512: I have a question.
  513: Yes, hHe was. Goodbye.
  514: " kill!"
  520: What? You? I… don't know what to say. He was such an evil man…
  521: A thank you would be enough.
  522: Humph.
  530: |-
    Oh, a thank you would be enough. I know this isn't right but… here, take this
     money. [Becky gives you 1000 dollars]
  531: Keep your money, Rebecca.
  532: Thank you very much.
  533: Tank!
  534: Ug! Perdy lady.

    You are wonderful man. Even though I don't condone your actions. You did the

  550: You are not welcome here. Please leave.
  551: Please leave.
  560: Why did you destroy my still? What did I ever do to you?
  561: I was paid to do it.
  562: I don't have to answer to anyone.
  563: I don't know what you're talking about.
  564: Whatever.
  565: Ooba gooba.
  570: |-
    Oh really? That sleaze Frankie put you up to it, I'm sure of it. I'll just
     make another one, you know.
  571: Doesn't matter. I got paid.
  572: So.
  573: I wouldn't be surprised.
  580: So, you're a coward too? Figures.

dcRnSlvr:
  100: You see a tough, middle aged slaver.
  101: You see slaver with a large scar on his face.
  102: You see a rather large slaver.
  150: There's a slaver who seems to enjoy his work.
  151: This slaver seems to be very strong but not to bright.
  152: This slaver seems to be well-armed, like the others.
  225: Let's get em.
  226: Only kill the hostile ones.
  227: Lead the way; we're right behind you.
  228: Only take out the hostile ones- the others are our pay.
  229: I'm ready to split some heads.
  230: Where they at? You see em?
  235: It's not time to leave yet.
  236: Get the last of the hostile ones.
  237: Leave the unarmed ones alone. Get the others.
  238: There's still some more bloodshed waiting for us.
  245: That was a horrible run.
  246: This was hardly worth it. We didn't get shit.
  247: Next time, only take out the hostile ones. This isn't all fun and games.
  248: Metzger's going to be pissed.
  255: Not bad -- but next time, leave the unarmed ones alone if you want us to get
    paid.
  256: That wasn't that bad. We got some decent slaves out of this.
  257: I've seen better, but at least we'll get paid.
  265: Hey, we did pretty good. We almost got them all.
  266: Thanks for your help.
  267: Good job. The pay for this run should be nice.
  268: That was fun and we should get a good cash out.
  275: We kicked some serious ass. Metzger better give us a big bonus.
  276: That was perfect! I'm going to get so shit-faced tonight.
  277: Fuck'n A. We kicked ass.
  278: That's the way to do it!
  285: Where they at?
  286: I'm gonna get me some lovin'.
  287: I bet I'll get more kills than you this time.
  288: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
  295: The rest of you are dead; you just don't know it yet.
  296: You can't hide from us!
  297: Come out, or I'll blow your fucking head off.
  298: Ah, that was good! Where are the rest of them?
  305: Shit.
  306: That sucked.
  307: Damn it.
  308: We better not do that again.
  309: Fuck... and I was going to drink up tonight.
  310: Let's just get out of here. This fucking sucks.
  320: Not bad.
  321: Hope we got enough. I need to replenish my jet supply.
  322: Let's go.
  323: I've seen better, but money's money.
  324: Metzger should be fine with these.
  325: Pretty good.
  326: Hurry up. Let's beat it.
  327: This should do just fine.
  328: Nice haul.
  329: Let's go. I want my money.
  335: Bonus time!

  481: What do you want?
  482: Oh, nothing.
  500: Huh?
  501: Never mind. You're free to go. Metzger's dead.
  510: Wha? Free? Bad men gone? We go now! Thank you. You friend! Bye!
  511: Free? What? You killed them all? Thank you so much! We'd better leave while
    we still can. Thank you again, you're a saint!
  520: Damn you!
  521: Rot in hell!
  522: You'll pay for this.
  523: Why are you even talking to me?
  524: Leave me alone.
  525: I don't want to talk to you.
  526: How could you?!
  527: I don't ever want to see you again.
  528: This isn't going to change things.
  529: I'll be on my way, if you don't mind.
  530: Please, just let me leave.
  531: Just let me be on my way.
  532: I still don't want to talk to you.
  533: Leave me alone.
  534: No chance.
  535: You think this makes things better?
  600: We go?
  601: No hurt?
  602: Go!
  603: Home!
  604: Free?
  605: Huh?
  606: What?
  607: Did you say free?
  608: I'm out of here!
  609: Let's go!
  610: Everyone! We're free!
  611: Yaaahooo!
  700: You free the slaves from their pens.
dcSlaver:
  100: You see a slaver.
  150: He seems to be one of Metzger's personal guards.
  200: There you are.
  201: Now you die.
  300: You want to see the boss? Go right in.
  301: Metzger's the man to talk to, not me.
  302: Go on in.
  303: Behave yourself.
  304: Metzger's right through this door.
  305: Don't piss Metzger off.
  306: We're not selling if that's what you're here for.
  307: Still can't get used to a woman slaver.
  308: Nice to have you with us.
  309: Hi. How's it going?
  310: You club any slaves yet?
  311: Hi again.
  312: Going to go on another run?
  313: Things are pretty calm.
  314: When am I going to see some action?
  315: I miss going on slave runs. Guarding sucks.
  316: Slave runs are a blast.
  317: Hey, man, glad to have you with us.
dcSlvGrt:
  100: You see a slaver.
  0: You see a slaver named Aidan.
  150: He looks like he could easily take care of himself in a fight.
  200: |-
    Ah, fresh meat.... Welcome ta the slaver's guild. The name's Aidan. Ya here on
     business? Ya better be.
  201: What exactly does your guild do?

     have ta talk ta Metzger, of course. Right though that back door.
  216: |-
    [Aidan looks you up and down.] You don't look like ya could stomach it, pal, but who
     am I ta judge? Ya gotta talk ta Metzger. He's through the back door.
  217: I said ta talk ta Metzger. You fucking deaf and dumb or just dumb?
  218: Who's Metzger?
  219: Another question for you then.
  220: Thanks, I will.
  221: Medger
  222: Uh… kay.
  230: Now you die.
  240: |-
    Ya gotta be shittin' me! We capture and sell slaves. That's what yer here for, right?
     Ya looking for some action?
  241: |-
    Ya gotta be shittin' me! We capture and sell slaves. If ya ain't here for that, whatta
     want?
  242: So, ya joined up. This should be interesting. If you like action, yer in the
    right line of work. If ya don't, ya won't last long.
  243: I never thought I would see that tat on woman. It looks good though. Surprised
    Metzger... fuck it. So what do ya need?
  244: What do ya want? Ya lost or somethin'?
  245: Hello again. li'l lady. Whatcha need?
  246: What?
  247: I'm looking to join.
  248: Where do you get your slaves?
  249: I'd like to buy some slaves.
  250: Do you know a man named Vic?
  251: I'm looking for a Merchant.
  252: You ever heard of Vault 13?
  253: Bye.
  254: Work.
  255: Food.
  256: Kill.
  257: Ug.
  270: Ah, a bloodthirsty one. Well... Talk to the boss. We might have a place for
    ya. Go through the back door.
  271: Metzger's never had a bitch slaver, but if you're really that bloodthirsty,
    check with him. He's right through that door.
  272: Okke.
  273: Uh.
  274: Krook
  280: Talk ta Metzger about that. He doesn't normally sell to the public. Has his
    hands full with... bigger customers.
  281: Who's Metzger?
  282: Can I ask something else then?
  283: Okay, bye.
  284: What about Vic?
  290: Ya don't say. Beat it!
  291: Dumb bitch.
  292: Oook?
  293: Hmph.
  300: Not likely. That dumbass Vic pissed Metzger off about some radio or something.
    I doubt that he'd sell'm. You'll have to talk ta him yourself.
  301: Well, I hear he finally fixed the radio. You should ask Metzger. He's not much
    use now, not very good trade quality.
  302: Who's Metzger?
  303: Where's Metzger at?
  304: Okay, thanks. Bye.
  310: He's in the back room right through the door over there.
  311: You playing with me? He's right back there. Just go through that door.
  312: Okay.
  313: Thanks.
  320: Damn, you don't know Metzger? What're ya doin' in this town, if not ta see
    him? He's the head of the Slaver's Guild.
  321: How many times do I have to tell ya? He's the slave master. He runs things
    in this town.
  322: Can I ask you something else?
  323: Okay, thanks.
  330: I ain't talkin' about that. Metzger'll string me up. Plus, we wouldn't want
    any outside competition.
  331: I already said. I ain't gonna talk about that.
  332: Tell me before I blow a hole through your head.
  333: I understand. Another question?
  334: Okay, bye.
  340: Listen here, ya li'le shit head, don't you dare threaten me or any one else
    in our guild, or you're dead. Get that? Dead.
  341: Listen here, ya li'l cunt. Don't you dare threaten me or any one else in our
    guild, or your dead. Get that? Dead.
  342: Now, young jet eye, you will die.
  343: Screw you.
  344: Sorry, please don't hurt me.
  345: Yeah, whatever. I'll let you live this time.
  350: Oh, really? Maybe I should just blow a whole through your head right here 'n
    now. What do you think, hot shot?
  351: Take your best shot.
  352: Don't make me laugh.
  353: I was just joking, man.
  354: I'm sorry. I was just trying to impress you.
  360: Run along, before I change m'mind.
  361: Okay.
  370: What? Oh, you must be looking for Mom's. You're one building off.  She's in
    the building directly south. S-o-u-t-h. That way. [Aidan points out the door.]
  371: Huh? Uh… Oh.
  380: Ya look like ya might fit in, but Metzger's never hired a woman. Not sure why,
    but I doubt he's  gonna start now.
  381: Ya don't look the type. Hell, Metzger's never hired a woman before. Not sure
    why, but I doubt he's starting now.
  382: I said ta talk ta Metzger.
  383: Who's Metzger?
  384: Another question.
  385: Thanks, I will.
  386: Medger
  387: Uh… kay.
  400: Nope, but I'd check with the boss. He's probably been all over the fuckin'
    place.
  401: Another question.
  402: Okay, thanks. Bye.
  410: Merchant? Oh, you must mean Vic, that guy that sells the old Vault stuff. He's
    fucked. Metzger pretty pissed with'm.
  411: Yeah, Vic… that Merchant guy, right? The one that sells the old Vault stuff.
    He's fucked. Metzger pretty pissed with'm.
  412: How many times you gonna ask me that? Metzger's got'm.
  413: Who's Metzger?
  414: Can I ask another question?
  415: Is he for sale?
  416: Okay, thanks.
  430: Hey, boys, look who's back.
  431: Run, it's a slaver! Ah, I crack m'self up.
  432: Back for some action?
  433: You know the way.
  434: Go on in.
  435: He's wait'n for ya.
  436: Now what?
  437: I know that ugly face.
  438: How's it goin'?
  439: Yer back. Ya gonna join up?
dcSmitty:
  100: You see a greasy old coot.
  150: You see Smitty the mechanic and junkyard owner.
  151: You see a greasy old coot with dirty work-clothes on.
  200: You varmint! Git outta here before I hafta learn ya!
  201: Git outta my place!
  202: Git off my land!
  203: Dang varmint, git outta here.
  204: Go the hell away from me.
  220: Hey, git off my land.
  221: You there, dumbass, git outta here.
  222: Git, go on, git!
  223: I ain't got time for your type.
  224: Sorry, I guess I don't speak idjit.
  240: Hello there, young feller. What can old Smitty do ya for?
  241: Hello there, cute-stuff. What can old Smitty do ya for?
  242: Jumpin' jiminy, what can I do for ya now?
  243: Hey there, I really enjoyed my meal from Mom's. Thanks. Now what can old Smitty
    do for ya?
  244: I was just wondering what you do here?
  245: Say, old timer, I have this thingy here that I picked up in Gecko….
  246: Hey Smitty, I was wondering about that car you had for sale.
  247: I brought your meal from Mom's.
  248: Say, old timer, I have this thingy here that I picked up in Klamath….
  249: I was just looking around a bit. See you later, Smitty.
  260: Let old Smitty here take a look at it.
  261: Sure, here it is.
  262: On second thought, let me ask you about something else.
  263: Maybe another time. Goodbye, Smitty.
  280: Let old Smitty here take a look at it.
  281: Sure, here it is.
  282: On second thought, let me ask you about something else.
  283: Maybe another time. Goodbye, Smitty.
  300: Well now, that looks to me like it's an old fuel cell controller. Hmm, I bet
    if I used that with the old Highwayman I could get her purring like a kitten.
  301: Huh?
  310: Hmm, that looks jist like a fuel cell regulator. If I had a car that ran, it'd
    sure improve the mileage on it.
  311: Huh?
  320: That was mighty darn kind of you. Thanks mucho, compadre. Here's a little something
    for your trouble. It'll come in handy 'round these parts. (He hands you a Stimpack.)
  321: Thanks, Smitty. No problem. See you around.
  322: Well, uhhh... Thanks, but I already headed over to Mom's and got some eats
    myself, so I won't be needin' that anymore.
  323: Oops, I'm not the usual delivery person. He called in sick today. Can I get
    some experience points anyway?
  324: OK, sorry about the mixup. I hope Mom doesn't fire me! I really need this job.
  325: You know we're not doing the free meal after 24 hours thing anymore, right?
  326: Well, maybe I'll just eat it myself then.
  327: Mom's not gonna be too happy with this.
  330: Well, you see, I've got this car, a Chrysalis Motors Highwayman. She's a beaut,
    too. They used to say "Nothing can stop a Highwayman." Built tough, that's what
    they were.
  331: Yeah, so what's that got to do with me?
  340: Well, you see, I thought I needed a battery for the thing but all I really
    need is a fuel cell controller. Them things was always going bad on 'em.
  341: Well, I've got one of those
  350: That right? Here's the deal. You give me $2,000 and I'll sell you the car.
    Heck I'll even install the fuel cell controller for you. Should run good as new.
    I'll even charge it up with some extra micro fusion power cells I got.
  351: That sounds good to me. Here's the money and the part.
  352: I don't think I want to do that right now. Let me ask you about something else,
    Smitty.
  353: Let me think about it. I'll see you around, Smitty.
  370: Jist take it easy with her 'til she warms up, now.
  371: OK, I will. Thanks, Smitty.
  380: Well, a lot an' not so much at the same time.
  381: Huh?
  390: What I'm saying is that havin' a regulator is nice but you need to find a fuel
    cell controller.
  391: Why's that?
  400: "'Cause if'n you had a controller, and $2,000, I could fix this here Chrysalis
    Motors Highwayman that I got here and you could drive around in style."
  401: Really? Where can I find a fuel cell controller?
  410: Now that's a silly question. Don't you think if I knew that then I'd be driving
    around in the car?
  411: Wow. I'll have to look for one of those.
  420: Be a good idea. If you find one jist come on back here with it. Oh, and don'
    forget the $2,000, neither.
  421: Sounds like a plan, Smitty. Hey, let me ask you about something else.
  422: I'm going to go look for one right now. Goodbye.
  430: Hey there, how's that car runnin' for ya?
  431: Pretty good, Smitty, but I found this part for the car and I don't know what
    to do with it.
  432: Great, Smitty, just great. Hey, I brought you a meal. Compliments of Mom.
  433: Real good, Smitty, real good. Thanks. See you around. Goodbye.
  450: Well now, that's a fuel cell regulator. That'll give you better mileage per
    energy cell. I could put that in for you, if you had say $750 for my trouble.
  451: That sounds like a deal, Smitty. Here's the part and the money.
  452: I'll have to think about it, Smitty. Goodbye for now.
  460: Mostly I just keep watch over all this old junk. Only got one thing worth doodly-squat.
  461: What's that?
  462: I figured that. Let me ask you something else.
  470: Why, it's none other than this Chrysalis Motors Highwayman. They used ta say
    that "Nothing can stop a Highwayman." They shore built 'em tough, I'll say that
    for 'em.
  471: Wow, does it run?
  480: If'n it ran, do you think I'd still be in this shithole of a town?
  481: Uh, yes.
  482: I guess not.
  490: Well, you're probably right. I got kinda settled in here.
  491: I see.
  500: Well, then again, mebbe' I would too. I got all comfortable here.
  501: I understand.
  510: I wouldn't mind selling the car though. If someone brought me the battery -
    no strike that, uh, I guess I'd need a fuel cell controller. Yeah, if'n I had
    one of them, I'd sell the car for $2,000. Even install the controller so it'd
    run right.
  511: That sounds interesting. I'll have to come back if I ever find a fuel cell
    controller. Let me ask you something else right now.
  512: When I find one, I'll be back. Goodbye, Smitty.
  520: There you go. Better'n new. Take it easy with her now.
  521: I will. Thanks, Smitty. Goodbye.
  600: YOU GET THE HELL AWAY FROM MY CAR!
  650: Don't let me catch you sneaking around my car like that again.
  651: You won't.
  652: Uggg-K
dcTubFri:

  110: You see a jet whore.
  111: You see one of Tubby's jet whores.
  150: He seems to be a friend of Tubby's.
  160: She seems to be extremely doped up.
  161: She seems to be suffering from massive withdrawals.
  200: Oh, man. Where we going to get our shit now?
  201: What'd ya kill Tubby for?
  202: Oh man, that sucks.
  203: Now what're we supposed to do?
  204: Oh, man…
  205: Hey, that's not fair.
  206: Don't hurt us, we won't tell.
  220: Wow, you look pretty mean.
  221: Hey, you're a real nice guy. Anyone ever tell you that?
  222: Hey, you're a real nice gal. Anyone ever tell you that?
  223: We're Tubby's guards.
  224: Don't mess with Tubby. This is his place.
  225: Damn, I'm feeling good.
  226: Can you believe we're guards? Cool, isn't it.
  227: This shit is great.

  230: Tubby keeps us happy.
  231: Oh boy, oh boy oh boy… Damn my eyes.
  232: Hey, man, you a slaver? Wow…
  233: Did that tattoo hurt?
  234: You slavers sure are tough.
  235: Isn't it dangerous being a slaver?
  236: Hey, I heard your boss got shot or something. Tough luck.
  237: Hey, you hear? Metzger's dead or something.
  238: Wow, someone diced the Metzger the Butcher.
  239: Hope Tubby can stay in business with Metz gone.
  250: Wow, man. He killed Tubby.
  251: I think my shit went bad.
  252: Woh, what's going on?
  253: What was all that noise?
  254: Dang, that was nasty shit.
  255: Wow, man. She killed Tubby.
  260: Ooooohhyaaa… Good stuff.
  261: What's that?
  262: Oh, yeah, I'm flying now.
  263: Oh so warm.
  264: She's so pretty.
  265: Oh, blackout… Shit, I can't see.
  270: Wow, you see that?
  271: Yeah, you know what it was?
  272: I think it was a bird.
  273: No, a dog.
  274: But it was flying man.
  275: No way - it zoomed across the ground.
  276: Yeah, you seeing things, man.
  277: No way. That was real.
  278: Whatever.
  279: Ohhhh it's kicking in again. Ahh.
  290: Pretty lights.
  291: Lots of lights.
  292: They're so warm.
  293: And the trees.
  294: Where are the women?
  295: So green and pretty.
  296: I like potatoes.
  297: Trees are made of wood.
  298: I like women and potatoes.
  299: They make smoke when they burn.
  300: But not together.
  301: Animals live in trees.
  302: No, not women and trees, women and potatoes.
  303: I can climb a tree.
  304: A woman climbing a tree eating potatoes? You're dumb.
  305: Where do trees come from?
  306: You can't climb a tree and eat potatoes.
  307: I like bushes, too.
  308: Well, not very easily.
  309: Because they're green.
  310: Potatoes aren't green.
  311: Ohhh, the pretty lights.
  312: Oh, my head hurts…
  320: Don't talk to me, man. My head hurts.
  321: I won't tell anyone.
  322: Don't hurt me.
  323: I didn't do anything.
  324: I didn't see anything.
  325: I didn't hear anything.
  326: Please, just leave.
  327: Lady, I don't feel much like talking. My fucking head is killing me.
  340: Oh man, you suck.

  342: Man, that hurt!
  343: What the hell?

  401: Jet makes me so horny.
  402: Tubby knows how to take care of his women!
  403: Isn't Tubby wonderful?
  404: Oh, baby- Wait! You ain't Tubby.
  405: Where's our big man at?
  406: Doesn't it just make your skin tingle?
  407: Tubby has the best supply in town.
  408: I feel so alive!
  420: Did you hear a load bang?
  421: Haven't seen Tubby in a while.
  422: Where's Tubby?
  423: You seen Tubby?
  440: Oh, my head!
  441: Where's Tubby! I think I'm going to die!
  442: I can't take this much longer.
  443: Oh, the pain is getting really bad.
  444: Tubby hasn't given us any in a while. Where he at?
  445: My lips are numb.
  446: I can't feel my fingers.
  460: Don't hurt me!
  461: Please, don't!
  462: I didn't take it!
  463: It wasn't me!
  464: Leave me alone!

  182: |-
    OK. Chems are the basis for this town’s economic system, just as another
     town may use grain or gold.
  183: Thanks.
  184: |-
    I have heard of a place called Vault City. But unfortunately, I can't
     help you with directions. You see, very few of us towns can offer acceptable
     exchange for the medical services they provide, so most of us have never been
     there.
  185: OK. Thanks.
  186: That's not the kind of information I would just GIVE away to anyone.
  187: Would a hundred bucks change your mind?
  188: How about I give you $50 and you tell me.
  189: |-
    What do you say you give me the information, or I give you a new hole
     in the head.
  190: Nevermind.
  191: Well, can I ask you something else, then?
  192: |-
    Sure, that kind of money MIGHT help me change my mind. But you ain't got
     it!
  193: I must have dropped it somewhere. I'm gonna go look for it.
  194: I don't think that's going to be enough.
  500: Sure Petey. I'll be there in a second.
  501: Hold on, Petey!
  502: I'm comin', I'm comin'.
  510: Here you go, Petey.
  511: You know, Petey, you should kick this shit.
  512: Take this and get the hell outta here, Petey.
dcTyler:
  100: You see Tyler.
  101: You see Tyler, the leader of this gang.
  150: He seems fairly strong.
  200: Hey, don't touch the fucking door.
  201: Moron.
  210: Now we finish it.
  220: Told you it would be a piece of cake.
  221: That was like leading lambs to the slaughter.
  222: That fucking bitch is finally dead!
  223: Thanks for the tip, that was sweet.
  230: Were the hell were you?
  231: Trap my ass! Fucking liar.
  232: I should gut you right now.
  233: So much for the plan, asshole.
  234: You better not have been jerking me around.
  235: How'd you fuck this one up?
  240: You just lead those dumb bastards here and we'll nail them to the wall.
  241: We're waiting.
  242: We can't wait all night.
  243: What are you waiting for? I'm ready for blood.
  244: Do it already! Don't let them get suspicious.
  245: Hurry the hell up.
  250: Who the hell are you and what do you want?
  251: So, what do you want this time?
  252: Metzger sent me.
  253: I'm here to inspect the church.
  254: I'll be back.
  255: 'Me '
  1255: "!"
  256: Aruwa?
  260: What the hell for? His stuff's not going anywhere.
  261: His crap still hasn't moved an inch.
  262: Oh, yeah. You're a slaver now, eh? So what did he want? It's not going anywhere
    - not like it could.
  263: He wanted me to check it for him.
  264: Well, he wants to be sure.
  265: Never mind.
  270: Sure he did. I've never seen you around here before. Now, beat it.
  271: Let me in there now, before I have to get angry on your face!
  272: Look, he had me come into town just to inspect his damn stuff. I could care
    less.
  273: Okay.
  280: |-
    Whatever, slaver. Just go on in. Does he think it's just going to up and leave?
     Who the hell would want that shit?
  281: |-
    Fuck it. Just go in. Does he think it's just going to up and leave? Who the
     hell would want that shit anyhow?
  282: Bye.
  290: Okay, fuck. It's not like I really care. Like you would know what to do with
    any of that shit anyway.
  291: Grrrr.
  292: Thanks.
  300: Beat it, tough guy, before I get angry on Your face.
  301: Beat it, bitch. Metzger wouldn't have sent a woman anyhow, so take a hike.
  302: Bitch? I'll show you what this bitch can do.
  303: Fuck you.
  304: "[Leave]"
  310: Beat it.
  320: That's nice. Me Tyler. Me go bye bye.
  321: Ur.
  322: Uh…
  330: Beat it, freak.
  331: Sukyu!
  332: Arug!
  340: I don't think so. Now beat it.
  341: Okay.
  342: But!
  343: Fine.
  350: Yeah, I bet you are. Who sent you?
  351: Yeah, you said that already, fuck head. Who sent you?
  352: Who do you think, moron? Now stop dicking around and let me in.
  353: The pink panther.
  354: Okay, you'll regret that.
  360: The what? Get outta here!
  361: But...
  362: Fine.
  370: Now what the hell does the boss want? Another stupid fucking inspection?
  371: Yes?
  372: What now?
  373: How's it going?
  374: Sorry, gotta go.
  375: Uk.
  376: Lub?
  380: Actually, great! Almost forgot - a buddy of mine won it big at the tables and
    he's sharing the wealth, if you know what I mean.
  381: Pretty fucking bored. I hate guarding - but, hey, things can't be that bad.
    A buddy of mine won it big at the tables and he's sharing the wealth, if you know
    what I mean.
  382: Big plans, then?
  383: Sounds like fun.
  390: Yeah, he's throwing a party tonight at his place. Should be a blast.
  391: Yeah, he's throwing a party tonight at his place. Should be a blast. I'd invite
    you, honey, but it's only for his closest friends.
  392: Down a few brews for me.
  393: I understand, thanks. Have fun.
  394: See ya.
  400: You better believe it! We're going to drink until we drop!
  401: Bye
  410: What the fuck do you care. Beat it.
  411: Yeah, so-so.
  412: You trying to annoy me?
  413: Not bad.
  414: Tired.
  415: Okay.
  416: Beat it.
  417: Been better.
  418: Oh.
  430: Can't wait for that party. Hope he has a few whores there again.
  431: My buddy really knows how to throw a party.
  432: Almost party time.
  433: Party! Wish I was there now.
  440: Hey, what's up? Almost time for that party.
  441: What's up?
  442: I have some information you might be interested in.
  443: Nothing.
  444: Uhg.
  445: Urseco?
  450: Damn, what the hell's wrong with you today? Lay off the chems.
  451: Chems are bad for you, man.
  452: Chems are bad for you, lady.
  453: "[Grunt]"
  460: Oh, yeah? What's that?
  461: It'll cost you.
  462: Lara's planning on hitting this place tonight.
  463: Wait a minute.
  470: |-
    You fucking earned this. Here's your money. I've been wanting to finish them off
     for a while.
  480: |-
    Yeah, fuck you. It depends on what it is. You tell me, then I'll decide
     if I pay you anything for it.
  481: Lara's planning on hitting this place tonight.
  482: No, sorry.
  490: Oh really? So that bitch has got some balls after all? Well, that's worth a
    $100.
  491: Thanks.
  500: |-
    Not so fast, slick. Just to be sure, we'll wait until after they show.
     You could be lying to me for all I know. You just be sure they show, and I'll pay you after.
  501: But I'm a lover, not a fighter.
  502: Sounds good.
  510: |-
    Look, I don't give a rat's ass what you are. I'm not giving you a dollar
     until after they show. We'll do the fighting, but you better be sure they show.
  511: Okay.
  600: So, you're the boss's new whipping boy?
  601: What do ya want?
  602: What's up with Metzger? Doesn't he trust us anymore?
  603: You done checking that shit yet?
  604: Told you Metzger's shit wasn't going anywhere.
  605: So, you finished in there or what?
  606: I'm sure Metzger needs you for something. Why don't you run along and check?
  607: What the fuck's wrong with Metzger? Thinking we're not guarding his shit...
  608: You still here? Don't you have another little errand to run for Metzger?
  609: So, you're the boss's new whipping girl?
  700: I'm not in the mood.
  701: Not now.
  702: I'm busy.
  710: The smart ass is back! So you really want in this church? Why? There's nothing
    in here you'd be interested in.
  711: Now what the fuck do you want?
  712: You see this mark on my forehead? Let me the in. Now!
  713: I'm his new bitch, that's why! If you don't let me in right now, I'll be sure
    you find yourself at the top of his shit list.
  714: Look, buddy. Metzger's going to have my hide if I don't inspect everything
    soon. You know how he gets.
  715: Non of your fucking business. If the Boss wants his shit checked out, that's
    what I do. I don't ask questions.
  716: Never mind.
  717: Shaka?
dcVic:
  100: You see a slave.
  101: You see Vic.
  150: This slave seems to be kept under tight surveillance.
  151: This is Vic.
  152: "[TALK]"
  153: |-
    Would you tell him I can't... wait. Who are you? You're not a
     slaver. What are you doing here?
  154: 'My name is '
  155: ". I’m here to get you out."
  156: 'I''m '
  157: ", but why have you been locked in this room?"
  158: Can you tell me where Vault 13 is?
  159: 'I’m '
  160: ". I'll be right back."
  161: 'Dubba iba '
  162: "."
  163: |-
    Metzger's still quite upset with me, even though we fixed his darn radio.
     He's threatening to sell me off! I'll do anything you ask if you can get me out
     of this mess.
  164: OK, I will.
  165: Sorry, I can't. Bye.
  166: Whoo.
  167: |-
    Oh, hi again. This darn radio isn't going to repair it's self. How does
     he expect me to fix it?
  168: Where can I get the parts?
  169: Maybe I can repair it.
  170: Can you use this radio I found?
  171: I’ll see what I can do.
  172: Spa pa?
  173: |-
    I know I can do it, I just need the spare parts. There is an old radio in
     my shack back in Klamath that has exactly what I need. You been to the Dunton's?
     My shack's... well, it was just east of their place.
  174: Do you mean this radio?
  175: I’ll go look for it.
  176: Hmmm...  I’ll be back.
  206: It's right here. [pointing to a map]
  177: That's great! I'll have the radio fixed in no time.
  178: Okay, I'll talk to Metzger.
  179: Thanks.
  180: Bye.
  181: Pardon? I'm sorry but I don't understand.
  182: hurm.
  183: Thank you! I'm forever in your debt. What can I do to repay you?
  184: Tell me where Vault 13 is.
  186: Come with me, I could use a hand.
  187: It was nothing. Good bye.
  188: Candy?
  189: |-
    Vault 13? There’s a Vault City east of here. I trade there,
     sometimes.
  190: Want to go there with me?
  191: Thanks. Bye.
  192: |-
    Sure, I’ll join up with you! This old fart has one big adventure left
     in him. I’m sure of it! I'm pretty good at repairing things too, despite what
     Metzger says.
  193: Great, let’s go.
  194: Welcome aboard.
  195: Whatever.
  196: Vic me bess frend.
  197: Want to join me on my search?
  198: Great! Thanks.
  203: Vault City is east of here. I’ll point it out on that map of yours.
  204: Thanks.
  220: Darn it. That's close, but I need the radio from my shack in Klamath. I know
    that one has the parts I need.
  300: Yeah, I can probably help you, but you've got to get me out of here first.
  301: I told you. If you can get me out of here, I'll help you with anything you
    want.
  302: How do we do that?
  303: You're on you own then.
  304: Okay, I'll see what I can do.
  350: You think you can help me out?
  351: Metzger still won't let me leave.
  352: I can't take much more of this.
  353: I'll do anything for you if you help me.
  354: I'll earn back any expenses you may incur!
  400: |-
    You haven't been by my place yet have you? I really need that radio,
     Metzger's getting angrier with me by the day.
  450: Where did you get this water flask?
  451: I had a water flask that had a big yellow 13 on it. Do you remember where you
    got it?
  500: Oh, yeah. I remember that. I bought that from Ed. He's a brahmin dealer over
    in Vault City.
  501: |-
    Water Flask? Oh, wait. Yea, I had a few dozen of'm. Sold pretty well. I got'm from Ed. A
     brahmin dealer over in Vault City.
  502: Vault City?
  550: Would you stop calling me Boss?
  600: Sure thing, Chief!
  601: I mean it STOP IT!
  602: I guess that'll have to do.
  650: You got it, Sport!
  651: Uggg!
  700: Bee my friend.
  710: |-
    Would you tell him I can't fix this without the parts. I don't know... wait.
     Who are you? Some new recruit? He didn't send you here to ruff me up again did
     he? It's not going to make any difference. I can't fix it here.
  750: |-
    Wow! You'd do that for me? I'd do anything if you could get me out this mess.
     Only problem is that Metzger's got me locked up here until I fix this radio and
     I don't have the parts I need.
  753: Where can I get the parts you need?
  754: I'll see what I can do.
  760: |-
    It's a long story. I guess you could say that Metzger's keeping me here until
     I fix this darn radio. The crystal's shot and I don't have any spare parts. How does
     he expect me to fix it?.
  761: Well, I'm here to get you out.
  764: Don't know. See ya.
  800: I've got to get this radio fixed. If you can help me do that, then maybe we
    can reason with him.
  801: Where can I get the parts?
  803: I doubt it. Good luck.
  810: Why'd you kill poor Mom… I guess you had your reasons… I'm sorry, Boss. It's
    not my place to question you. This is a pretty bad town. I'm sure she did something
    pretty bad.
  811: Hey, Boss. Thanks for getting me out of that mess with Metzger. You need anything?
    Mom's been kind enough to feed me while you've been gone. I help her around the
    place….
  812: Bye.
  813: Oooh.
  814: Beiye
  823: Where is your friend Ed, again?
  830: I would if I could, but you're just not looking good. I'd only be a burden.
    Now that Mom's gone, I think I'll just head out. Don't know where… maybe we'll
    see each other again. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
  831: I would if I could, but you're just not looking good. Looks like you can barely
    take care of yourself. I'd only be a burden. I'll just wait here, Mom's cooking
    reminds me of my ex-wife….
  832: I would, honest. I'd do almost anything for you. It's just that you don't look
    like you're in any shape to lead anyone. I'd only be a burden. I'll just head
    over to Mom's, in a bit… until you can work things out. I haven't had her home
    cooking on a long time.
  833: Sorry, Boss. Looks like you're pretty crowded. Now that Mom's gone, I think
    I'll just head out. Don't know where… maybe we'll see each other again. Thank
    you for everything you've done for me.
  834: You're looking a bit crowded, Boss. I'll just wait here for you until you've
    worked things out. Mom's cooking reminds me of my ex-wife… not sure if that's
    a good thing or bad thing….
  835: I would love to, Boss. It's just that you don't look like you have any more
    room. I'll just head over to Mom's. I haven't been there in a while. Just come
    get me if you find some room for me.
  840: Ed's over at Vault City. He's a Brahmin Dealer. He was just one of my many
    suppliers. Vault City's not to far from here.
  845: I told you, it's over here. [Vic points to a location on your PIPBoy2000.]
  900: You learned about Vic being a trader.
  1000: I need to ask you something.
  1100: Fully healed, Boss. Anything else?
  1200: Almost perfect condition, Boss.
  1300: I'm mostly heled up, Boss, but I've been better.
  1400: I tried, Boss, but I'm not doing so hot. I'll do what I can though.
  1500: What ever you say, Boss.
  1501: Here? Right here? Okay, you're the, Boss.
  1502: Right. I'll stay here until you come back, Boss. You will come back, right?
  1503: As long as you want. I'm not going anywhere.
  1504: Of course, Boss.
  1600: If you say so.
  1601: Good call Boss.
  1602: Great thinking, Boss.
  1603: Sure, Boss. Anything else?
  1604: Away it is, Boss.
  1605: No problem, Boss.
  1606: Done, Boss.
  1700: Sure, Boss.
  1701: Close it is, Boss.
  1702: You know best, Boss.
  1703: I'm right behind ya, Boss.
  1704: Like glue, Boss.
  1705: If you say so, Boss.
  1706: Oh. Okay, Boss.
  1800: OK, I'll keep my distance, but not to far, Boss.
  1801: Okay, I won't, Boss.
  1802: I'll just stay back a little then, Boss.
  1803: Sure, Boss.
  1900: Right Boss. I'll hang way back.
  1901: What ever you say, Boss.
  1902: There you go, Boss.
  1903: Standing back, Boss.
  1904: Backing away, Boss.
  1905: Spreading out, Boss.
  1906: Okay, Boss.
  2000: Uh, Boss? You seem a bit crowded. I'll just keep waiting here for ya.
  2100: |-
    You're scaring me, Boss. What's happened to you? You look... well,
     scary. I think I'll just hang out here for a while...
  2200: You bet, Boss!
  2201: Darn right I will, Boss.
  2202: Sure thing, Boss.
  2203: Ready to go when you are, Boss.
  2204: Great! Let's go.
  2205: Great!
  2206: You're the best, Boss!
  2207: You won't be disappointed. No more mistakes!
  2208: I'll be careful this time, don't you worry!
  2209: I knew you would forgive me for that… um. So, uh, Boss. What's the plan?
  2210: I won't let you down, Boss!
  2211: You're super, Boss!
  2212: I knew I wasn't too old for this. Those were just bad odds! Right, Boss?
  2300: |-
    From Ed. He's a brahmin dealer over in Vault City. You been there before?
     Let me show you on that map thing of yours.
  2305: Vault City. Here. Let me show you on that fancy map thing of yours.
  2310: He should be around here somewhere.
  2311: Vault City. Check that fancy map thing of yours.
  2403: Where did you get the Vault 13 water flask?
  2404: Never mind.
  2500: Sure, Boss.
  2501: Ask anything, Boss.
  2502: I'll help you if I can, Boss.
  2503: I'm not in trouble am I, Boss?
  2504: Did I do something wrong, Boss?
  2505: Of course.
  2600: What'll we do now, Boss?
  2601: What's the plan, Boss?
  2602: Doing my best, Boss.
  2603: What can I do for you, Boss?
  2604: Change of plans, Boss?
  2605: Different strategy, Boss?
  2700: |-
    Boss, they got me good. You've got to get me to a doctor. I don't know if I can
     back you up anymore.
  2701: |-
    I need a doctor, Boss. I'm really messed up. I don't know if I can fight
     with you anymore.
  2702: Boss, I'm really messed up. You got to get Lenny to check me out.
  2800: Hey, Boss. You want me to join up with you know?
  2801: Hey, Boss. I don't mind waiting for you. I'm a real patient man.
  2802: We joining up again, Boss? I'll try harder.
  2803: I was afraid you might not come back. It sure is nice to see you again, Boss.
  2804: You looking for company again?
  2805: I'm ready to go, Boss.
  2806: I knew you wouldn't leave me.
  2807: Need some back up?
  2808: Need something repaired, don't you? I'm your man, Boss!
  2809: Don't worry, Boss. Sulik and I'll get along,  honest.
  2810: Let's go.
  2811: Stay here. I'll be right back.
  2812: Me go.
  3100: What? Uh… okay, Boss. If you say so.
  3101: Can I put something else on, Boss? I'm a little worried.
  3102: Okay… you're not going to leave me here… Are you, Boss?
  3103: But… I mean… Of course, Boss. Coming right off.
  3200: Well, Boss…. I'm pretty good with small arms. I can handle almost any rifle,
    shotgun, and most small-medium pistols. I 'can' use knives. I've also got a pretty
    good throwing arm, but my aim's not the best in the world… actually it's pretty
    horrible. Sorry, Boss. I'm really trying to get better.
  3201: Like I said, Boss, I prefer small arms. I can handle almost any rifle, shotgun,
    and most of those small-medium pistols. If we're really in a pinch I can try using
    a knife or even thrown weapons.
  3300: I 'can' use knives and I've got a pretty good throwing arm, but… my aim's
    not the best in the world. Actually it's pretty horrible. Sorry, Boss. I'm really
    trying to get better.
  3301: Like I said, Boss. Knives and I've got pretty good throwing arm… I just miss
    a lot.
  3400: I've had it up to here!
  3401: I'm going to rip your darn head off! No one hurts my family!
  4000: Over here?

  4103: Ow!
  4104: Ouch.
  4105: Dang it.
  4106: Medic?
  4107: I'm hanging in there… barely.
  4200: I never liked this place.
  4201: Why is this place so clean?
  4202: Did you smell something, Boss?
  4203: You know, Boss. I don't think I'll be coming back here when we're through.
    I can no longer call it home.
  4204: It sure is a lot dirtier than I remember.
  4205: We're not staying here long, are we Boss?
  4206: This place'll never change.
  4207: Boss, I'm not going to miss this place.
  4208: Thanks again for getting me out of this place, Boss.
  4209: I really owe you one, Boss.
  4210: Wow, this place sure has changed.
  4211: I haven't been here in ages.
  4212: I'm going to retire here.
  4213: I could open a repair shop around here.
  4300: Ah, a site for sore eyes. This is… was my place, but I guess you knew that.
    Right, Boss?
  4400: Sulik, don't you be looking at me like that.
  4401: Boss, Sulik's glaring at me again.

  4507: Still waiting.
  4508: What's that smell?
  4509: Anything to repair around here?
  4510: Here I am… waiting for the Boss.
  4511: An old man like me, wasting away his talents, just standing here.
  4512: I sure wish I had a stick of gum… it's been decades.
  4513: I need to get out of the relic business… nothing but trouble.
  4514: Why is waiting so tiring….
  4600: Uh, thanks, Boss.
  4601: Thanks.
  4602: You sure you know what you're doing?
  4603: Can't we just rest instead?
  4604: Should we make camp?
  4605: Am I that bad off?
  4700: Not to much, Boss.
  4701: If you insist, Boss.
  4702: Boss, my head's not going to explode, is it?
  4703: Boss, I think I'm starting to like that stuff.
  4704: I'm feeling a bit funny, Boss.
  4705: You sure you have enough of that to spare.
  4706: Sure, Boss. I'll take some.
  4707: Thanks, Boss.
  4708: Not bad.
dcVicGrd:

  200: Hey! Hands off.
  201: That's it!
  210: Problems?
  211: Practicing?
  212: Hmmm.
  220: There you go.
  230: Hey, how's it going?

    like that. Not too sure.
  251: His name's Vic - some merchant that broke something of the boss's, or something
    like that. Not too sure.
  252: Oh, him? Yeah, some merchant. I think he broke something, but I'm not sure.
    Why? You know him?
  253: Oh, him? Yeah, some merchant. I think he broke something, but I'm not sure.
    Why? You know him?
  254: Yeah?
  255: Why are you guarding him?

  257: Can I see him?
  258: Well, I'm fairly skilled in repairing things. Maybe I could help?
  259: Well, I'm fairly skilled in the sciences, maybe I could help?
  260: The door's locked. Could you open it?
  261: Thanks.
  275: Thanks for cash. I'm just letting you talk to him. No funny stuff. He can't
    leave that room without Metzger's okay.
  276: Now, I'm just letting you talk to him, okay? No funny stuff. He can't leave
    that room without Metzger's okay.
  277: Okay.
  285: To be sure no one bugs him while he works on something for the boss, but mainly
    to be sure he doesn't run off.
  286: Just to be sure he doesn't run off, I guess. He fixed that radio somehow.
  287: Who's your boss?
  288: Can I see him?
  289: Can I see him?
  290: Okay thanks.
  295: Oh, sure. I didn't mean you could see him, now that you're a slaver and all.
  296: Oh, sure. I guess so. He's not busy and he's not going anywhere, so no harm
    I guess.
  297: Well, could you open the door then?
  298: Okay, thanks.
  305: Of course. I didn't know you wanted to talk to him right now, sorry. I just
    thought you were curious or something.
  306: Thanks.
  310: Huh? You just in the habit of walking around into places you don't know? This
    is the Slaver's Guild.
  311: Oh, so that would make your boss's name…
  312: Oh, that's where I am? I though I was in Kansas.
  313: Okay, thanks.
  320: Where? No, never heard of it. This is the Den. Not sure about that place, but
    I don't get out much. Sorry.
  321: Moron.
  322: Uh, okay. Thanks.
  330: Damn, man. Metzger's the slaver master. He runs things around here.
  331: Damn, lady. This is the last place a lady like you would want to be. Metzger's
    the slaver master.
  332: Oh, where's his office?
  333: Okay, bye.
  340: Right through the back door there.
  341: Thanks.
  350: Sorry, I don't understand.

  370: Sure, you can see him.
  371: Sure, you can see him. Let me unlock that for you.
  372: Tank.
  380: Oh really? I'm sure the boss would appreciate it. Just as long as he stays
    put. We don't want him running off again.
  381: Thanks.
  390: No, sorry. He's busy working on something for the boss.
  391: Sorry, can't do that. Direct orders from the boss.
  392: Well, you got my money?
  393: I just need to ask him a few questions.
  394: Oh, come on. Just let me talk to him real quick.
  395: Yes. Here.
  396: No. I'll come back.
  397: Who's your boss?
  398: Nevermind. Bye.
  410: Stop bothering me. Go talk to Metzger. He's the boss.
  411: Leave me alone! What's your problem?
  412: I said talk to Metzger!
  413: Okay, fine! You can talk to him, but that's it! He's not stepping a foot outside
    that room. Got it? Now beat it!
  414: Okay.
  415: Thanks!
  430: Yeah, talk to Metzger. I'm sure he has some work available. I think he said
    he needed another man.
  431: Yeah, talk to Metzger. I'm sure he has some work available. He said he needed
    another man… but I'm sure you'll do.
  432: Talk to Metzger.
  433: Ruru?
  434: Uh?
  435: Oh.
  450: Get him, guys.
  451: Get her, guys.
  460: He's busy.
  461: Please, he won't leave the room. I promise.
  462: Can't we work something out - financially maybe?
  463: Okay, bye.
  470: Well, uh… I don't know. I guess it wouldn't hurt just for you to talk to him.
    $300 and I'll let you in.
  471: You're nuts. That's too much!
  472: Screw you, buddy!
  473: Sure.
  474: Sorry, can't afford that.
  480: Fine, see if I care.
  481: Okay.
  482: Fine.
  490: No, sorry.
  491: I said no. Now beat it. You've got to talk to Metzger
  492: Okay.
  500: To bad you didn't join us.
  501: You should join the guild.
  502: Just doing that guard thing.

  116: |-
    We of the Brotherhood of Steel seek to find this most devastating weapon of our ancestors, and
     secure it from those who would abuse the power of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.
  117: Why?
  118: |-
    Well...because the Brotherhood of Steel is dedicated protecting the weak and defenseless, and
     this thing could really hurt someone.

  120: Umm...because it's really the only moral thing to do.
  121: Why?

     though.
  134: Since you have two of them, maybe you could give me one.
  135: |-
    No. No. Couldn't do that. Wouldn't be right to end your quest that easily. There's some more
     of them that way. Go get your own. [He points in a direction about the same way you pointed when you
     told him where the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch was.]

  126: I want a tank!
  127: Where's my chainsaw?
  128: Don't hurt me.
  129: I didn't mean to be such a jerk.

    You see a cute, raven-haired girl with a winsome expression. She is gazing dreamily into the

  106: Ian? I think he's still in Fallout 2 somewhere. The Abbey, maybe?
  107: |-
    Actually, I hear *I'm* in Fallout 2 somewhere. I don't want to go find me, though...might creep
     us both out.
  108: Sorry I didn't have better combat skills in Fallout 1. I guess I didn't get
    out much.
  109: Say...do you and Tycho still keep in touch?
  110: |-
    So there was this bug when you rescued me from the raiders and brought me back to Dad, he'd go

    Greetings friend, my name is Willy and have I got a deal for you. [He seems to be reading from

    A bargain at any\n price, but for you it's on special for only "
  109: "Why it's made of only the finest wood around. Use it to jab at critters to
    keep them at bay or,\n if you're skilled enough, throw it. It's very aerodynamic
    and won't break on impact.  What do you say?\n It's a steal at only "
  110: "This weapon is made of the finest recycled steel. Just feel how that fits
    comfortably into your\n hand. And don't worry, our engineers have tested it for

  114: I'll take it.
  115: I'll pass.
  116: Yes indeedy, you won't regret this. It was nice giving you the business. See

  138: All right, I'll lower the prices.
  139: How about a 20% discount?

  103: Where are you headed?
  104: What do you do?
  105: Ug.
  106: Well...I don't know. I'm pretty new to this area and I've only been to the
    following areas.
  107: New Reno
  108: Vault City
  109: Redding
  110: The Den
  111: San Francisco
  112: New California Republic
  113: An abandoned mine.
  114: No, I've been there already. Thanks anyway.
  115: |-
    New Reno -- now that's a great place to go. Sex, chems and gambling.  What more can one ask for?
     Here, let me show you where it is.
  116: Thanks.
  117: |-
    Vault City -- now that's a city of morons. Grow an extra finger and they treat you like some kind
     of freak. Never been inside, but I know where it is.
  118: Thanks.
  119: |-
    Redding...I don't know much about it, other than it's an old mining town. It's located up north,
     right smack dab in the middle of some of meanest mountains you've ever seen.
  120: Thanks.
  121: |-
    I'd stay away from the Den if I were you. It's a magnet for lowlifes of the area. I'll show you
     where it is, but I don't recommend you go there.
  122: Thanks.
  123: |-
    San Francisco. Um...all I can say is that the people there are...strange. It's located on the
     coast.
  124: Thanks.
  125: |-
    The New California Republic...now there's a nice place. I'd like to settle down and live there
     some day. Clean, nice people, and very well maintained. It's located right here on your map.
  126: Thanks.
  127: |-
    Yeah, a while back I came across an abandoned mining camp. Thought I'd rest there a day or two,
     but then wolves started showing up and I thought it best if I left. A shame, too; it looks like the
     miners left in a hurry. They left a lot of stuff behind. I'm not planning to go back, so I guess it's
     all right if I show you where it is.
  128: Thanks.
  129: Oh...it doesn't really matter. I just decided to travel one day and well, here
    I am.
  130: Maybe you can help me. I need some directions.
  131: What do you do?
  132: Nice talking to you.
  133: I do odd jobs here and there to get me by. But mostly I just travel.
  134: Maybe you can help me. I need some directions.
  135: Where you headed?
  136: Nice talking to you.
  137: I really should be going now. It was nice talking to you.
  138: Maybe we'll meet again.
  139: I want to make the next town by nightfall. I'd better go.
  140: I'd be going.
  141: Ambush!
  142: Can't trust anyone these days.
  143: You have broken the code of the traveler.
  144: Time to go.
  145: I've overstayed my welcome.
  146: I must depart.

    Fallout 1.

    I thought about talking to the designers about it, but I figured as long as Ian didn't cop a feel, it

    We musta spent three hours on the character gen screen before my player FINALLY decided to
     actually *play* the game.

    There was this one player, Vince DeNardo, who had this tactic for keeping Dogmeat alive at the

    visit?

  175: Good luck. I'll be back later.

    I guess now the best thing is to hide. You want anything else?
  188: Yes.
  189: No. See ya.
  190: Got the Hubologists. No problem. Need anything else?
  191: Yes.
  192: No. See ya.
  193: 'You just made a big mistake, pal. I just turned the Shi and the Hubologists
    against you through their computers. You''re finished in San Francisco. '
  194: I guess I'd better kill you then.
  195: Give me a few hours to get myself together.
  196: You want me to hack a formatted computer? The information's gone. It ain't
    gonna happen.
  197: I am going to have to vacate this place.
  198: Good to see ya.
  199: I'm looking for some fuel.
  200: I've heard the Hubologists have some fuel, and I could take a looksee in their
    computer for you.
  201: The Shi have all the fuel around here.  I could take a gander at their mainframe
    for you.
  202: Can you?
  203: What the hell do you want?
  204: Badger of the punks, I presume?
  205: You have disgraced our Emperor for the last time!
  206: I think I will go get some candy from Lao Chou in town.
  207: So much for a fair trial. Hmmm...
  208: Dude, lighten up. I just wanted some candy.
  209: Can you transfer the fuel from their spaceship to the tanker?
  210: Can you get me a copy of their vertibird plan?
  211: Can you transfer the fuel and get me the plans?
  212: Yes, I need what they have.
  213: Nah, I'll figure out another way.
  214: All right, but shit might hit the fan.
  215: Can you transfer the fuel from their reserves to the tanker?
  216: Never mind, I'll do it another way.
  217: Never mind.
  218: Alright.  Check back with me in a day or so and I'll let you know.
  219: Did you get what I needed?
  220: Yeah, I got the fuel.
  221: Yeah, I got the verti plans.
  222: Yeah, I got the fuel and the plans.
  223: Thanks a lot. See ya.
fcbadpea:
  100: You see a person in funny pajamas.
  101: You see a Shi townsperson.
  102: This person looks different from anyone you've seen before. They don't seem
    to care much about you.
  103: You're not a spy, are you?
  104: Who are you?
  105: Fish and seaweed. That's all we get.
  106: Ha ha! Look at the funny round-eyes!
  107: You look like a Hubologist.
  108: Leave us in peace.
  109: Long live Lo Pan!
  110: Down with the Dragon!
  111: Lo Pan is a hero.
  112: Look out for the Dragon. He's trouble.
  113: Those punks are always so loud.
  114: 'Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::'
  115: Isn't there more to life than this?
  116: We're smarter than you think.
  117: Look! A lao wai!
  118: Welcome to San Francisco.
  119: You seem like a person with a straight head.
  120: Lo Pan can use your help.
  121: Don't hurt the people in red, lao wai.
  122: Lao wai means "foreigner".
  123: You're on our side, right?
  124: Kill the Dragon for us, will you?
  125: You honor us with your presence.
  126: Our leader! Stricken!
  127: We must get vengeance for Lo Pan!
  128: Who will lead us to greatness if Lo Pan is dead?
  129: What shall we do now?
  130: We are dishonored. We should be dead like Lo Pan.
  131: Life holds no meaning.
  132: If Lo Pan is dead our dreams are crushed.
  133: Lo Pan was the last great leader.
  134: The Dragon is dead! Lo Pan is victorious!
  135: Mock the losers!
  136: The Dragon has fallen!
  137: Lo Pan! Lo Pan! Lo Pan!
  138: We are the winners!
  139: The Dragon is dead. Yeah!
  140: 'Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::'
  141: Isn't there more to life than this?
  142: We're smarter than you think.
  143: Look! A lao wai!
  144: The Emperor's mouthpiece! Dead! The city will fall apart!
  145: What happens now?
  146: I hope the savages don't overrun us now.
  147: The good always die young.
  148: I hope we can survive without Ken Lee.
  149: I hear that Ken Lee was the only one who kept the Emperor in line.
  150: 'I hear that the Emperor was only a faзade for Ken Lee. '
  151: Maybe Lo Pan could take Ken Lee's spot...
  152: 'Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::'
  153: Isn't there more to life than this?
  154: We're smarter than you think.
  155: Look! A lao wai!
  163: You killed AHS-9? Yeah!
  164: Those Hubologists give me the creeps.
  165: You have done us a great service.
  166: Death to the Hubologists!
  167: This will hurry those Hubologists out of here.
  168: Stupid Hubologists, can't even protect their own leader.
  169: The Hubologists better not come after us in revenge.
  170: I guess you're not a spy.
  171: Son of a pig! Die!
  172: You have dishonored your family!
  173: Leave us alone, lao wai!
  174: Haven't you done enough damage?
  175: I hate you!
  176: Leave this city!
  177: Go home to your people!
  178: Do not darken my life with your face!
  179: What will it take to get rid of you?
  180: Help! Help!
fcchemst:
  100: You see a Shi man with a scowl on his face.
  101: You see Dr. Jing Tie Gahng
  102: You see a Shi man with a lab coat.
  103: Who are you? What do you want?
  104: Wha?
  105: Who are YOU?
  106: I'm
  107: None of your business.
  108: Nothing. I'm leaving now.
  109: You don't belong here if you're an imbecile. Run along now, before I call the
    guards.
  110: You really don't understand me, do you? Perhaps you will understand the guards.
    Guards! Intruder!
  111: "-done-"
  112: I am Jing Tie Gahng. I am in charge of the chemical laboratory of the Steel
    Palace... and you are interrupting important work. Please leave. NOW - before
    I call the guards.
  113: Go ahead and call them, old man.
  114: Fine, fine. I'm leaving.
  115: Well,
  116: Yes. I'm here to obtain fuel for the Poseidon Oil tanker.
  117: I would like to know what you do here.
  118: I'm here to obtain fuel for the Hubologists.
  119: No. I'm just leaving now.
  120: Ahh, but you see, it is my business. This is my lab. Now, state your business.
  121: I'm here to obtain fuel for the Poseidon Oil tanker.
  122: I would like to know what you do here.
  123: I'm here to obtain fuel for the Hubologists.
  124: No. I'm just leaving now.
  125: You want fuel for the tanker? I want hardened power armor. I understand a Hubologist,
    one called Crocket, has a process whereby a regular suit of power armor can be
    upgraded. Get me such a suit and I will divert the fuel for you.
  126: I'll do that.
  127: I can't make any promises.
  128: I have one right here.
  129: I create compounds and devices for the Emperor and for the Emperor's advisor,
    Ken Lee. Currently, I'm working on fuel derivatives and polymers that will withstand
    massive attack. Of course, this is of no interest to you since it is, for the
    most part, theoretical.
  130: Actually, it is of interest. I'd like fuel for the Poseidon Oil Tanker.
  131: I'll bet it would be of interest to the Hubologists. They want fuel.
  132: Not yet, it's not. But I'll be back.
  133: They want fuel, do they? Well, as irritating as they are, they do have their
    uses. I have heard they have developed a process wherein they make a suit of power
    armor even more invincible. If they will upgrade such a suit of armor for me,
    I will pass the fuel along the pipeline. I assume it's for their toy spaceship.  It
    is the one called Crocket that you will wish to speak with.
  134: I'll do that.
  135: I can't make any promises.
  136: I have one right here.
  137: Even if I wanted to help you, I could not. Our fuel reserves have been depleted.
    Perhaps you would be better off asking the Hubologists for their help. Goodbye.
  138: Oh. Well, that's all, then.
  139: That will be quite impossible. Our fuel supply has already vanished. Even if
    I wanted to help the Hubologists, which I do not, I couldn't. Good day.
  140: Okay. Bye.
  141: Good. Then let me get back to what I'm doing.
  142: "-done-"
  143: You can't do it? Then I can't sell you the fuel. Now go away. I'm busy.
  144: "-done-"
  145: You have hardened power armor? Excellent! How do you want to be paid?
  146: Channel fuel to the Hubologists in exchange for this.
  147: Channel fuel to the Poseidon Oil tanker.
  148: How about some money? I think $
  149: I decided I'd rather keep it.
  150: Consider it done. I'll make the adjustments shortly. Now, if you'll excuse
    me, I must get back to work.
  151: Thanks. Bye.
  152: So much? Ah! Yet, for such a powerful suit of armor to study... very well.
    Here is your money.
  153: Thanks. So long.
  154: You want to keep it? Very well. If you should change your mind, let me know.
  155: I will. Bye.
  156: Fat chance. Bye.
  157: 'Guards! Guards! The outsider is back! Kill him! '
  158: Have you spoken to this Hubologist who calls himself Crocket, and gotten the
    armor?
  159: No, not yet.
  160: Then why do you keep coming back here to bother me?
  161: Because I have some questions.
  162: I have no idea. Goodbye.
  163: Do not try my patience.
  164: What do you want?
  165: What do you do here?
  166: I'm here to obtain fuel for the Poseidon Oil Tanker.
  167: I'm here to obtain fuel for the Hubologists.
  168: Nothing. Sorry.
  169: We're all out of fuel now. I can't help you with anything else. I'm too busy
    with this armor. Good day.
  170: "-Bye-"
  171: ". I'm just looking around."
  172: ", do you actually have business here?"
  173: " would be nice."
  174: I have all that I need. Talk to Wong if you must.
fcchip:
  100: You see a bald punk.
  101: You see Chip. He looks better.
  102: You see a bald punk. He seems much recovered.
  103: Ooh, my guts... ow, ow, ow.
  104: Duts?
  105: Owie?
  106: What's the matter with you?
  107: You're in pain? Ha ha ha.
  108: Who are you?
  109: Do you have any information for me about my people?
  110: Oooh, my guts. I'm in pain. Please leave me alone.
  111: Okey-dokey.
  112: 'What''s the matter with me? I''ll tell you: It''s that I got drunk last week,
    started gambling with Lao Chou, and lost. I was so blind drunk that I bet my spleen.  Now
    he has it, and I need it back.'
  113: You SOLD your spleen?
  114: That's too bad.
  115: What a dummy you must be.
  116: Yeah, well, I need some information instead of your bellyaching.
  117: "::he gasps for air:: Fuck you."
  118: "::he gasps for air:: Piss off."
  119: Yeah, whatever.
  120: Hey, I changed my mind. I want to help.
  121: Yeah, I sold it. I was drunk! Plus, I think Lao Chou slipped some Jet in my
    drink. I need my spleen back because I'm getting infections now.
  122: Hey, you lost it. It's your problem. You deal with it.
  123: Well, hell, I'll take a look for it.
  124: Yes, it is. I need my spleen back because I'm getting infections now.
  125: Hey, you lost it. It's your problem. You deal with it.
  126: Well, hell, I'll take a look for it.
  127: I really appreciate this. Go talk to Lao Chou, the merchant, and tell him I
    need my spleen back.
  128: I'll be back.
  129: I'm Chip. And I'm in a lot of pain.
  130: What's the matter with you?
  131: You're in pain? Ha ha ha.
  132: That's too bad. So long.
  133: Information? I'm in pain and you want information?
  134: What's the matter with you?
  135: You're in pain? Ha ha ha.
  136: Forget it.
  137: Have you found my spleen yet?
  138: Yes. Dr. Wong Yi Tze has it, and he'll give it back to you. Go talk to him
    about it.
  139: Yes. Go check out Dr. Wong's corpse.
  140: Kind of. Dr. Wong Yi Tze has it. He doesn't want to give it to me.
  141: I found out where it is, but I think Dr. Wong has eaten it.
  142: No, not yet. But I will.
  143: No. Actually, I'm not looking.
  144: 'All right. ::pant:: Before I do, maybe we ought to set up a way to get it
    back in me. Talk to Dr. Fung about that, right? Thanks.'
  145: All right.
  146: No.
  147: I really appreciate what you're doing for me. I won't forget it.
  148: No prob.
  149: Dude, I can't really get places without a lot of effort.  If you can't help
    me, I'm screwed.
  150: Fine. I'll go talk to Fung.
  151: Fine. I don't give a crap about you anyway.
  152: If you could do something about it... kill him, or talk some sense into him,
    or something... I'll die without it.
  153: I'll see what I can do.
  154: Sorry, man... I think you're screwed. I can't help.
  155: With no spleen, I'm going to die. Thanks for your help anyway.
  156: I found it. Go over to Dr. Wong's place.
  157: Oh, I'll cover you. Get over to Fung's.
  158: No prob. Good luck.
  159: Did you talk to Fung?
  160: Yeah, and he says he'll stick it in you for free.
  161: Yeah, and he's charging me $1,000.
  162: "[]"
  163: Wow. You have some serious connections. Come back in a day and I'll see what
    help I can give you.
  164: You got it.
  165: Can you cover me?
  166: Yeah, I suppose.
  167: No.
  168: I really appreciate this. Come back in a day and I'll see what help I can give
    you.
  169: You better.
  170: I can't afford to do this on my own. I guess I'm going to die.
  171: Oh, fine, I'll cover you.
  172: Tough. I'm broke.
  173: I can't tell you how much better I feel. Now, what was it you wanted from me?
  174: How do I run this boat?
  175: Where are my people? Do you know?
  176: I need some computer work done.
  177: Nothing right now, thanks. Bye.
  178: Check with the Captain. He lives in the captain's office upstairs.
  179: Thanks. More questions...
  180: Thanks. Bye.
  181: Word has it they got taken west, across the water. Your best bet in getting
    there is getting this tub running.
  182: Thanks. More questions...
  183: Thanks. Bye.
  184: Computer work? If you can't get it from the Shi or the Hubologists, you'll
    want to talk to Badger. He's a whiz.
  185: Thanks. More questions...
  186: Thanks. Bye.
  187: Shit. Talk to the Hubologists or the Shi. With Badger dead, I have no idea.
  188: Thanks. More questions...
  189: Thanks. Bye.
  190: Scumbag.
  191: You're going to need some painkillers.
  192: Dirtball. I'm going to work you over.
  193: You see a bald punk.
  194: You see Chip. He appears to be in a lot of pain.
  195: You see a bald punk. He is holding his side and gasping in pain.
  196: All right. I will talk to Fung.
  197: Any more luck with my spleen?
  198: Yeah, and he wanted $1000 - but I paid for it.
  199: Thanks for all your help, buddy.
  200: Dude, I heard you found my spleen. Did you know to talk to Dr. Fung about putting
    it back in me?
fccrocke:
  100: You see a fairly young, balding scientist. He looks intent on his job.
  101: You see Crocket, the Hubologist scientist.
  102: You see a relatively young, balding scientist. He seems like a slovenly geek.
  103: Yeah? Whaddya want?
  104: Agh. Um. Duur.
  105: Dr. Jing sent me. He wants some hardened power armor.
  106: You can upgrade power armor?
  107: Who are you?
  108: What do you do here?
  109: Nothing, thanks.
  110: I swear, there are more subhumans running around every single day. Shoo! Shoo!
  111: Awww.
  112: Yeah, I can do that. But what are you willing to trade for it?
  113: Dr. Jing will probably be willing to sell you fuel for the spaceship.
  114: I can pay for it.
  115: I'll let you live.
  116: Nothing. Forget it.
  117: I'm Crocket. I'm a scientist and fix-it guy. Can I get back to it?
  118: No. I have more questions.
  119: Yeah, sure.
  120: I develop new technology and I get my share of cultist tail, if you catch my
    meaning.
  121: So you're not an Hubologist?
  122: I got it. I have more questions.
  123: No. What do you mean?
  124: What new tech have you developed?
  125: Loud and clear. See ya.
  126: Well... I *guess* that'll have to do.  It's a deal. Do you have the armor to
    be hardened on you?
  127: Yes.
  128: No.
  129: Great. That'll cost you $10,000, straight up, no bartering. I need some new
    equipment.
  130: "$10,000? That's outrageous! I don't have that kind of money!"
  131: All right. Here you go.
  132: I'll get back to you.
  133: |-
    ::he looks amused::
    Are you really threatening me for this?
  134: Yes. Do it or die.
  135: No, I was just kidding.
  136: Leave it here for a day and I'll do it. Before you go, you ought to know I've
    only got the material to do this for two sets of armor.
  137: Sure thing. I have more questions.
  138: I'll be back for the armor.
  139: I can't very well work my magic on it if you don't have it. Come back when
    you do.
  140: I have more questions.
  141: Bye.
  142: |-
    ::he shrugs::
    You want this armor or not? It's $10,000 flat out.
  143: I'll get back to you.
  144: Fine. Here.
  145: Highway robbery. No way.
  146: |-
    ::he looks into your eyes and decides that you're serious::
    Do you have the armor here?
  147: Yes.
  148: No.
  149: |-
    ::he looks into your eyes and decides that you're bluffing::
    Try it, bucko. You'll have guards down on your ass and you'll never learn how to harden your armor.
  150: Fine. Die, pencil neck.
  151: Shit. You called my bluff.
  152: Bluffer. I think we'll see what the guards have to say about this.
  153: Dammit!
  154: These guys don't know real science - I help them justify their extravagance
    in exchange for some downtime with the ladies and a hefty salary.
  155: Hmm. I had more questions I wanted to ask.
  156: Not bad at all. See ya.
  157: Let's see... I built a nuclear reactor for the spaceship. I created the hardening
    process for power armor. And I fix things that are broken.
  158: I see. Well, I have more questions.
  159: Hmm. Gotta go. Bye.
  160: Hey, I got no beef with you. Just don't hurt me.
  161: I have some questions for you.
  162: I'm here for my armor.
  163: Too late.
  164: Bye.
  165: It's not ready yet. You have to give me time!
  166: Fine. I have some questions.
  167: Fine. I'll be back.
  168: I've got it right here for you. Take it, take it.
  169: Thanks. I have questions.
  170: Thanks.
  171: Thanks. NOW you can die.
  172: I'm out of chemicals for it. Sorry.
  173: Then you can answer me some questions.
  174: Then you can die.
  175: Oh. Damn. Bye.
  176: So where's my fuel? You promised me fuel, asshole.
  177: You'll get it, you'll get it. Now answer some questions.
  178: Yeah, well, I screwed you.
  179: And for the last time, too. GUARDS!
  180: Die, asshole.
  181: Shit. I'm outta here.
  182: Ok, now what do ya want?
  183: You ready to pay the $10k this time?
  184: Leave it here for a day and I'll do it. Remember though, this is the last set
    I can make.
  185: Hey, I have another suit for you to upgrade.

  107: What do you want?

    man.

  119: What brought you down?

  121: I show these guys how to move their data and I answer stupid questions all
    day long.

  123: What sort of stupid questions?
  124: Well, I have other questions for you.

  130: I'll keep it under my hat. I have some more questions.
  131: Ha ha! What a schlepp you are! She's a porn star, buddy. She doesn't want you.
  132: You realize that she'll just act interested in you to make sure you stay a
    good Hubologist, right?
  133: Well, yeah... but it's worth it in case something happens!
  134: If you say so... if you say so. I have more questions.
  135: Whatever. See you.
  136: |-
    ::he sits in stunned silence for a moment::
    ::pain crosses his face::
    Oh well.
    ::he turns his head away::
  137: I'll bet you want to get back at her.
  138: Sorry. I have more questions.
  139: Having delivered that news... so long!
  140: You bet I do. What do you need?
  141: I need the vertibird plans from your computer.
  142: I need you to format the Hubologist hard drive.
  143: I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the
    Poseidon tanker.
  144: I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.
  145: Nothing. So long.
  146: There you go. Now get out of here. I'm going to format the computer and leave.
  147: I need the vertibird plans from your computer.
  148: I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the
    Poseidon tanker.
  149: I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.
  150: Well, I was really just kidding. She didn't actually say that.
  151: Good luck. See ya!
  152: There. Teach these bastards to use and reject me. Goodbye.
  153: Well, I was really just kidding. She didn't actually say that.
  154: Goodbye.
  155: She didn't say that. Oh good.
  156: So, I've done all this harm for nothing. I'm going to kill you now.
  157: Try it.
  158: 'She did? Really? Wow. ::a beatific smile slowly crosses his face:: Thanks!
    What can I do for you?'
  159: I need the vertibird plans from your computer.
  160: I need you to format the Hubologist hard drive.
  161: I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the
    Poseidon tanker.
  162: I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.
  163: Ahh, nothing. Go on and have some fun.
  164: There you go. Anything else?
  165: I need the vertibird plans from your computer.
  166: I need you to format the Hubologist hard drive.
  167: I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.
  168: I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the
    Poseidon tanker.
  169: Nope. So long!
  170: Format the hard drive? Are you kidding? No way! I can't do that!
  171: It's just a routine cleaning. I've backed up everything else already.
  172: Oh, all right. I have more questions.
  173: Oh, all right. Bye.
  174: 'Oh. Well, if you''ve backed everything up, I''ll do it. ::he taps at the keyboard::
    There you go.'
  175: Thanks! So long!
  176: I just played you like a sucker. So long!
  177: I'll check that myself. I don't think it's safe to format the mainframe just
    yet.
  178: All right. I have more questions.
  179: All right. Bye.
  180: No, no... I'd be too embarrassed.
  181: Fine, fine. I have more questions.
  182: Fine, fine.
  183: I should be able to. But only if you have a specific task in mind.
  184: Divert fuel into the Poseidon tanker.
  185: Can't think of anything specific right now. I'll let you know.
  186: 'Oh, like:'
  187: '"Does my terminal have 3D-card support?"'
  188: '"Why can''t I get multiuser hookup?"'
  189: '"I think we ought to change the interface, even though this one works perfectly
    well!"'
  190: '"Why can''t I use a sword or a chainsaw on my monitor?"'
  191: '"I should be able to have two guns. Why can''t I use two guns?"'
  192: '"The interface on my terminal is slow and clunky. I think it''s your fault".'
  193: Like that.
  194: I see. Those people sound like they're lots of fun. I have more questions.
  195: I see. Well, so long.
  196: I could do that. But I'd need a good reason to do it, and I just don't have
    that. Sorry. Anything else?
  197: Yes, I have more questions.
  198: No, I guess not.
  199: Sorry, their system hasn't been responding for a while. There's no way for
    me to get into it.
  200: I'm going to move on Vikki... umm... soon. What can I help you with?
fcdockid:
  100: You see a kid.
  101: You see a dock kid.
  102: You see a kid.
  103: I don't like this place.
  104: There's a big dead smelly fish on the beach.
  105: Eww! What's that?
  106: The air smells funny here.
  107: Wanna go swimming?
  108: I'm gonna go play.
  109: Where's my mommy?
  110: We live on the beach!
  111: I'm boooored.
  112: Eeeee!
  113: Help!
  114: Oh no! The boogeyman!
  115: Mommeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
  116: Run away! It's a monster!
fcdocsqa:
  100: You see a dirty, ill-kempt person.
  101: You see a squatter.
  102: You see a dirty, ill-kempt person.
  103: This is one of the best homes we've had in years!
  104: Ahh... sea air!
  105: This is the life, eh? No bosses, no governments... just the clean sea breeze.
  106: There's a car in the ocean there. Too bad it's rusted out.
  107: I'll bet the kids love it here.
  108: Fresh seafood every night! Tasty, even if it has two heads.
  109: Our neighbors are certainly "interesting."
  110: We'll be moving on sometime, I'm sure.
  111: You like our homes?
  112: I love living on the beach.
  113: Please don't hurt me!
  114: No! Don't hurt me!
  115: Leave my children alone!
  116: Stop! Don't hurt us!
  117: I'll do anything!
  118: Help!
  119: Oh no! An oppressor!
  120: Oh, if only we had guards!
  121: I regret giving up the protection of society now...
fcdokwrk:
  100: You see a Shi peasant.
  101: You see a dockworker.
  102: You see a Shi peasant whose clothes are smeared with fish scales, tar, and
    salt.
  103: Nice day to be at the ocean.
  104: I always did like the waves.
  105: You like fish juice?
  106: Sun, fresh air, and seafood. What more could anyone want but a bath?
  107: I am getting sick of fish.
  108: My back hurts.
  109: Oh, look... Another tourist.
  112: Look out for the monsters in the tanker. Oh, wait... I guess you already did.
  113: So you're getting through the tanker all right?
  114: That tanker's a tough place. That's what the punks say.
  115: Are you getting somewhere in there?
  116: Nice day to be at the ocean.
  117: I always did like the waves.
  118: You like fish juice?
  119: Sun, fresh air, and seafood. What more could anyone want but a bath?
  120: I am getting sick of fish.
  121: My back hurts.
  122: Oh, look... another tourist.
  125: "[]"
  126: "[]"
  127: "[]"
  128: "[]"
  150: Time to die, tourist.
  151: Think you can handle a dock fight?
  152: I don't think you'll be too tough.
  153: Let's see how you like the rough and tumble of a Shi dockworker!
fcdragon:
  100: You see a barechested Shi man.
  101: You see the Dragon, hero to many of the Shi peasants.
  102: You see a barechested, well-muscled man whose hands look like dangerous weapons.
  103: How may I be of assistance?
  104: Dinkle humper doo!
  105: You who?
  106: Who was that you were fighting?
  107: Who are you?
  108: Teach me how to fight.
  109: I wish to challenge you.
  110: Forget it.
  111: 'I am afraid I do not understand your language. ::he bows:: Good day.'
  112: Byeeeee!
  113: I am the Dragon, friend. I fight oppression and my enemy, Lo Pan, who desires
    to control this town.  I fight, and I teach others to fight.
  114: Teach me!
  115: Tank yu.
  116: Then we will begin.
  117: "-done-"
  118: "::he looks at you closely:: I do not believe you would use the knowledge for
    good. Good day."
  119: Grrr!
  120: Please excuse my rudeness. I cannot speak with you right now.
  121: Duhhh... okay!
  122: That was Lo Pan. He is my sworn enemy and my rival. If he triumphs over me,
    then I fear for the good of the people.
  123: The people are sheep. You should serve yourself.
  124: Then you must triumph.
  125: I see. I have more questions.
  126: You truly believe this? Then perhaps you should deal with Lo Pan. Good day.
  127: "-done-"
  128: That I must. Yet we are still evenly matched, I fear.  Even in our followers,
    we are matched. It will take one person to throw the balance.
  129: I am that person.
  130: I see. Well, I have more questions.
  131: I see. Well, so long.
  132: Are you? Perhaps we should test you. I will only have him bested in honest
    combat.
  133: Hey, he's going to die one way or the other. What difference does it make?
  134: Sounds fair to me. How does this test work?
  135: Oh. Well, in that case, I gotta go.
  136: Those who fight without honor are no better than animals!
  137: Okay, Pollyanna. Relax.
  138: I call it smart fighting. "Honor" is a word invented to glorify killers.
  139: Got it. I have more questions.
  140: Riiight. See ya.
  141: First we determine if you wish this to be a fight to the finish, or a test
    of your skills against mine.
  142: To the finish. I can take you.
  143: A test of skills. I don't want to kill you.
  144: Neither. Forget it.
  145: You are not the right one for this duty. Good day.
  146: "-done-"
  147: 'You think so? War and fighting seem unavoidable. Better we should fight with
    rules and codes than giving in to sheer destruction. '
  148: I win any way I can.
  149: If we have to fight, then we should fight to survive. If someone is trying
    to kill me, I will defend myself by whatever means possible.
  150: Hm. You have a point. Well, I have more questions.
  151: Yeah, okay. Bye.
  152: Very well. Let us enter the ring and fight until one of us can no longer move.
  153: "- attack now, with armor and weapons -"
  154: "- enter the ring, remove armor and weapons, and fight hand to hand -"
  155: Ah, a warrior. I shall pit you against my men to see how well you fare. Let
    us begin.
  156: "-begin-"
  157: Yet, in a formalized fighting environment, you cannot dispute that you have
    entered this arena of your own choosing. Once you have so entered, should you
    not abide by its rules?
  158: Yes, probably. But in a live or die situation, you must do anything to survive.
  159: No, I don't think so.
  160: You have a point. Well then. If you wish to fight Lo Pan, will you do it unarmed
    and unarmored? If we are to ask for your aid in this, we request that you abide
    by our rules.
  161: Yeah, I'll do it your way.
  162: Nope. Forget it.
  163: Excellent. Then let us see if your skills are strong enough to fight Lo Pan.
  164: Let's go.
  165: Not right now. I'll come back for it later.
  166: I am the Dragon, protector of the people and sworn enemy of Lo Pan. He and
    I are the last masters of our fighting style.
  167: I'm not too bad at hand-to-hand combat myself. Wanna give me a try?
  168: That's interesting. Must be rewarding. I have more questions.
  169: Thanks. Bye.
  170: You have attempted to dishonor my people, so now I must kill you. I apologize
    if I hurt you as you die.
  171: "-done-"
  172: Do not speak to me, sheep of the Hub. I have no use for your kind.
  173: "-done-"
  174: You have the honor of a pig and the morals of a lungfish. I do not wish to
    associate with you.
  175: "-done-"
  176: You are truly amazing in your fighting skills. Will you fight Lo Pan?
  177: Yes. I'll do it right now.
  178: It's not really my fight.
  179: Sure. But I have some questions.
  180: I understand. Should you change your mind, you know where to find him. Simply
    tell him you come in the name of the Dragon.
  181: Right. I have questions.
  182: Err... okay. Bye.
  183: I have recently returned from a mission of honor. We were strong that night.
  184: Great. I have questions.
  185: Great. Bye.
  186: Lo Pan is dead! I  have you to thank, I am sure. Now I am confident that my
    school will lead our fighting style into the future.
  187: Great. I have questions.
  188: Great. Bye.
  189: Your kung fu is no good here.
  190: I'll beat you someday, Dragon.
  191: I will be waiting for you, Lo Pan.
  200: The Dragon detects your advance and you slip by him.
  201: A thief has no honor among the Shi. Leave now.
  202: I warned you to leave. Now you shall pay.
  203: It appears that you need no more training from me.
  204: Lessons are more than just physical, grasshopper. Ponder this and return tommorow.
  205: I am Master Ziggy, your final test.
  206: I am Zurak. Be ready.
  207: I am Jimmy. Prepare yourself.
  208: I am Herb. You will get no further.
  209: I am Jobe. It is your time to be beaten.
  210: I am Master Rube. You are finished.
  211: FIGHT!
  212: Training is still in your future.
  213: And away we go!
  214: You have beaten the Dragon in mortal combat. Although a fair fight, his loss
    will be felt by many.
  215: You have already defeated my men, and you have passed my test. You are ready
    fight Lo Pan.
  216: Your skills will only be advanced though their use. I can no longer help you
    in your study.
  217: Let us begin. Follow my lead.
  218: Training is done for the day.
  219: The Dragon is very good, but you have learned.
  220: You have already defeated my men. No others wish to challenge you.
  221: Even though you did not know, you have helped our cause by removing Lo Pan.
    You have our thanks.
  222: It was my pleasure. Bye.
  223: You Welcome. Bye bye.
  224: Your welcome. Can I ask a question?
  225: Welcome. Me ask?
  226: You WIN!
  227: You LOSE!
  228: Next Opponent!
  230: First, you will need to prove you can do it. I will have you go up against
    five of my fighters - one at a time. If you beat them then you will receive your
    final test.
  231: What is that?
  232: Sounds like too much trouble. Bye.
  233: Humbly, I will test your abilities myself.  However, none of these battles
    will be to the death.
  234: Ok, let's do this.
  235: You can take care of Lo Pan yourself.
  236: "[The Dragon studies you] I regretfully cannot let one of your skill level
    hurt themself."
  237: Ok, but can I ask something else?
  238: Fine. Bye.
fcdrfung:
  100: You see a wizened old man wearing a white smock.
  101: This is Dr. Fung.
  102: You see a wizened old man wearing a white smock
  103: Help you with something?
  104: Owie! Ouch! Owwwwwww!
  105: Yeah - I'm hurt and it looks like you're a doctor.
  106: Yes. I need a doctor for my friend.
  107: Do you have any stimpacks? I'd like to buy some.
  108: Who are you?
  109: I have a friend who's missing a spleen. Can you help him?
  110: What can you tell me about this place?
  111: Bye.
  112: Let me take a look at that. Hmm. Yes. I'll have to charge you, of course.
  113: How much?
  114: Forget it.
  115: I can heal... but  for a price, you understand.
  116: How much?
  117: Forget it.
  118: Who am I? I am Dr. Fung. I teach and I heal.
  119: Dr. Fung? Do you know Doc Holliday?
  120: Pleased to meet you. I need healing.
  121: A friend of mine needs to be healed.
  122: I see. Thanks. Bye.
  123: Holliday? Yes! I taught him all he knows! Where is he now?
  124: He's living in Broken Hills.
  125: He went home, did he. I hope he has found peace there.
  126: I think he has. I have more questions.
  127: Probably. I have to go. Bye.
  128: That'll cost you $100.
  129: I'll pay.
  130: Forget it.
  131: This appears serious. That will cost $200.
  132: I'll pay.
  133: Forget it.
  134: Those are impressive wounds. $300 is all it takes to procure my services.
  135: I'll pay.
  136: Forget it.
  137: For this much damage, I'm afraid that I will have to demand  $400.
  138: I'll pay.
  139: Forget it.
  140: Sit down. You'll need to when you hear my bill. Crippled limbs cost $600.
  141: I'll pay.
  142: Forget it.
  158: What? You do not have the money? How do you expect me to survive if you ask
    me for free healing?
  159: Do you have stimpacks?
  160: No thanks.
  161: It has been a pleasure doing business with you.
  162: Thanks.
  163: Your offer, sadly, is not acceptable.
  164: How about this?
  165: It's all I want to offer. So long.
  166: 'You''re hurt? Tsk, tsk. Ancient remedy will cure that. '
  167: O-kay!
  168: "[]"
  169: We're done. Now, you go and be careful!
  170: Tanks!
  171: You need more?
  172: I need healing.
  173: I have a friend who needs healing.
  174: Who are you?
  175: Tell me about this place.
  176: I have a friend who's missing a spleen. Can you help him?
  177: No. Thanks, though.
  178: You have come to the right person. Would you like long history or short?
  179: Long.
  180: Short.
  181: Neither. I have other questions, though.
  182: Our people landed here on the submarine Shih-huang-ti, when the missiles exploded
    over the world. With the aid of a cult, we, the Shi, rebuilt San Francisco. That
    is the short version.
  183: How about the long version?
  184: Thanks. I have more questions.
  185: Thanks.
  186: 'The long version is this: We are here because our people are the descendants
    of the crew of a nuclear submarine, called the Shih-huang-ti. When the missiles
    fell in the Great Deluge, the systems aboard the submarine failed and we drifted
    in the dark for many days.'
  187: "-more-"
  188: At last, we drifted ashore. We found ourselves near the ruins of San Francisco.
    Most of the city was devastated in the war. We had to recreate society based on
    the few survivors who had crept back to the city.
  189: "-more-"
  190: We rebuilt with what we could find, and we have scientists and technology the
    world must envy. We are rebuilding civilization, but not as that horrid Master
    creature did.
  191: I see. I have more questions.
  192: Thanks. Bye.
  193: Of course I can. And since you are aware of Doc Holliday... I will do it for
    no more than the sake of friendship. Tell your spleenless friend to come here
    and I will replace it for him.
  194: Thanks! I have more questions.
  195: Thanks!
  196: Yes. I can do this. It will cost you $1000 dollars to do it. Up front. Do you
    accept?
  197: Yes.
  198: No.
  199: Tell your friend to come here and I will replace it for him.
  200: Thanks. I have more questions.
  201: Thanks.
  202: I can do nothing for him, until you have the $1000. Good day.
  203: Good day.
  204: I do not treat the enemies of my people. My humble apologies.
  205: Honored sir, I recommend you seek out your cult's doctors.
  206: What can you tell me about armor implants?
  207: I helped write the article on armor implants. All it takes is my expertise
    and your materials. What sort of implants do you desire?
  208: What sort are there?
  209: The dermal implants.
  210: The dermal upgrade.
  211: Phoenix implants.
  212: The Phoenix upgrade.
  213: Umm… forget it. I have other questions.
  214: None, actually. Bye.
  215: We have dermal implants, which protect against concussive damage. If you like
    that work, we can add a single enhancement to it. We also have Phoenix implants,
    which protect against heat-based attacks, and which also have an upgrade available.
    If you’re interested in the upgrades, you will of course have to wait until the
    initial set has been installed. And before you ask, yes, you CAN have all four
    operations.
  216: Great. I’ll take the dermal implants.
  217: I want the dermal implants.
  218: Give me the dermal upgrade.
  219: I’d like the Phoenix implants.
  220: Time for the Phoenix upgrade.
  221: Umm… forget it. I have other questions.
  222: None, actually. Bye.
  223: Excellent. I’ll need a set of combat armor and, oh, $5500. You’ll need two
    days and the ability not to pick at scabs.
  224: Let’s do it.
  225: Forget it. So long.
  226: The dermal upgrade, eh? That will cost you several days of your life, $33000,
    combat armor, and a brand-new set of scars that you’ll never ever lose as long
    as you live.
  227: So? I can afford ALL of that.
  228: Hmm. I don’t think I want to pay that much. So long.
  229: If you do not mind parting with $8500, a few days, and a set of combat armor,
    we can begin the operation now.
  230: Strap me down, doc. I’m ready to go.
  231: That’s a little steep. Let me get back to you.
  232: This is a major operation. It will cost you your "good looks", a set of combat
    armor, and $49000. Are you willing to invest in this?
  233: Hell yes. Let’s do it.
  234: Wow. That’s… expensive. I’ll get back to you.
  235: "::he shakes his head:: Do not toy with me. You are missing necessary ingredients.
    Listen more carefully to me next time. Now go, and come back when I can help you."
  236: Okay.
  237: There you go! You are … enhanced. Remember… do not pick at the scabs unless
    you want horrid scarring to add to your suddenly not-entirely-pleasing appearance.
  238: Thanks, doc. So long.
  239: I have the money for the spleen.
  240: Are you interested again in implants?

  100: You see a short, rotund Shi man.
  101: You see Dr. Wong Yi Tze.
  102: You see a short, rotund Shi man.
  103: May I assist you with something?
  104: Daghi nu?
  105: You who?
  106: I hear you have someone else's spleen.
  107: Who are you?
  108: What do you do here?
  109: No, thanks. That's all.
  110: I must confess, I do not speak your tongue. Perhaps you ought to speak to Ken
    Lee, he understands many different languages.
  111: Aagh!
  112: I am Dr. Wong. I am the head scientist of this installation.
  113: More questions, please.
  114: Thanks. Bye.
  115: I oversee the scientific experiments we create and run here. I also am in charge
    of the computer network.
  116: What are you planning?
  117: How does one get access to the computer network?
  118: I have other questions.
  119: I see. Bye.
  120: Ah, but if I tell you our plans, then everyone will know. I'm afraid they are
    secret plans, for now.
  121: Fine, fine. I have other questions.
  122: Thanks. Bye.
  123: How about if I stick a gun under your nose and force you to tell me?
  124: Why, one learns how to hack into it, or how to make friends with one of my
    underlings. I'm joking, of course, about hacking into it - if you were to do that,
    I'd send someone after you to kill you. [He smiles to show he means no offense.]
  125: Would you really kill me?
  126: So you wouldn't have any real objections to me getting into the computer?
  127: I have some other questions.
  128: Sure you would. Bye.
  129: Then I would have to regard it as a threat and warn you that such a course
    of action might be detrimental to your health.
  130: Let's give it a try.
  131: I was just kidding. I have other questions.
  132: "[He smiles] We must protect our honor, stranger."
  133: Err, right. So would you have any real objections to me getting into the computer?
  134: Riiight. I have other questions.
  135: I'll bet. Bye.
  136: If you can convince my subordinates into doing so. But I certainly won't.
  137: What if I shoved a gun under your nose?
  138: Great. Well, I have more questions.
  139: Hmm. I see. Well, so long.
  140: Ahh, yes! Indeed. I will prepare it with fava beans and a nice chianti.
  141: You've still got it? Good. Chip needs it back.
  142: That's a human spleen, you sick bastard!
  143: You do know that you're supposed to serve liver with that wine instead of spleen,
    right?
  144: That's a human spleen, you know.
  145: Who is this Chip? It's my spleen now, and I'm having it for dinner.
  146: Chip's the original owner of the spleen. He was drunk and sold it to Lao Chou.
  147: He needs it to survive, you know. It came from inside his body.
  148: Then maybe I'd better kill you for it.
  149: A deal is a deal. He can't have it. Sorry, but we made a bargain and just because
    Chip regrets it now doesn't mean he can go back on his deal.
  150: "-more-"
  151: It's a human spleen? Lao Chou didn't tell me that!
  152: Yet, because of the rudeness of the messenger, I believe I will hold all parties
    to the bargain. I will experiment on it instead.
  153: Tell your friend to come by for it within the next day, and I will gladly return
    it to him. I just hope you can find a way to replace it in his body in time.
  154: Very well.
  155: |-
    Ha ha! Yes, I too saw that old movie.
    Wait... what are you saying? Are you saying that...?
  156: Yes, it's a human spleen.
  157: Actually, I would object to that. You have not shown yourself to be of good
    character. Indeed, I do not know why I am talking to you. Good day.
  158: "-done-"
  159: Aiee! Guards! The lao wai intruder is here!
  160: You have certain schematics to give to me?
  161: Ken Lee told me to give these to you.
  162: Yes. Now what do I get?
  163: No, not yet.
  164: Speak to Ken Lee, and he shall discuss what happens in your future. Thank you.
    We shall be able to verify some of our test data with these. Good day.
  165: I actually had other questions.
  166: So long.
fcelgrd:
  100: You see a well-armed guard.
  101: You see an Hubologist guard.
  102: You see a well-armed person with a cruel look to the eyes.
  103: Intruder!
  104: Get the intruder!
  105: Over here! Over here!
  106: Time to die, infidel! The Great Wheel rolls over you!
  107: We are the Guardians. You are to die now.
  108: Star Father, guide my aim.
  109: You have defiled our tenets!
  110: If the lawyers don't work, our weapons will.
  111: We are the long arm of the Hub's law.
  112: Transgressor!
  113: Watch your step.
  114: Tread lightly, outsider.
  115: Don't touch anything you're not supposed to.
  116: If you step out of line, we'll make raw meat of you.
  117: Be very, very careful.
  118: We are the law of the Hub. Don't break it.
  119: I am AHS-4.
  120: I will "align" you if you misbehave.
  121: I have sanction from the Great Wheel.
  122: Greetings, fellow traveler.
  123: Greetings,
  124: Glad to have you with us.
  125: Go on about your business.
  126: Don't bother those who try to focus.
  127: Your presence is welcome... over there.
  128: The Hub has set us to watch over his flock.
  129: The Star Father cares for you. That's why he gave you us.
  130: We're loyal to AHS-9.
  131: Obey.
  132: Sleep.
  133: Consume.
  134: We have your best interests at heart.
  135: "."
fcelrind:
  100: You see someone in a floppy robe.
  101: It's another robed Hubologist.
  102: It appears to be someone wearing a robe.
  103: Who are you? What are you doing here?
  104: You're not supposed to be here, are you?
  105: Look! Rim meat!
  106: Hey! Who let the rim meat in?
  107: You shouldn't be wandering without an escort.
  108: Ahh! You're messing with my neurodynes!
  109: Go away, infidel!
  110: Don't talk to me - I'm a busy person.
  111: Hey! You're pot-holing my neurodynes!
  112: Maybe I'd like you better if you got aligned.
  113: The Star Father will love you if you let him.
  114: Don't you want to see Quetzel? Come join us!
  115: Go talk to AHS-7 and join up!
  116: We have celebrities who are Hubologists, you know.
  117: Juan Cruz and Vikki Goldman are famous! That's why I joined.
  118: I'll bet the celebrities will talk to you if you're nice and cool.
  119: I love the Hub.
  120: I like being a Hubologist.
  121: I want to actuate my potentiality.
  122: I'm still learning the lingo, to tell the truth.
  123: Praise the Hub!
  124: Praise the Great Wheel!
  125: We're going to Quetzel!
  126: I'm looking forward to going home to the stars.
  127: Please don't bother me; I'm concentrating my neurodynes.
  128: Please don't de-align my neurodynes.
  138: Oh no! The persecutor!
  139: The unenlightened one!
  140: Keep away from me, evil meat!
  141: You obviously have some bad neurodynes!
  142: No! Do not pollute me with your hatred!
  143: Guards! Guards! The barbarian is here!
  144: Don't touch me!
  145: Help! Guards!
  146: The enemy of our people!
  147: The dark times are upon us again!
  148: Star Father! Save me from the heathen!
  149: Someone will smite you for your perfidy!
  150: I love the Hub.
  151: I like being a Hubologist.
  152: I want to actuate my potentiality.
  153: I'm still learning the lingo, to tell the truth.
  154: Praise the hub!
  155: Praise the Great Wheel!
  156: We're going to Quetzel!
  157: I'm looking forward to going home to the stars.
  158: I'm about due for an alignment.
  159: I'm waiting to hear AHS-9 speak again!
  160: I hope my neurodynes are all right.
  161: I want to be a higher Aligned Hub Seeker!
  162: Time for me to focus on my self-growth.
  163: '"Real" science is all a pack of lies.'
  164: Don't listen to what "scientists" tell you.
  165: Only the Hub and AHS-9 have the answer.
  178: Praise the Star Father! We're going to the stars at last!
  179: Planet Quetzel, here we come!
  180: All that hard work has finally paid off!
  181: My neurodynes are entirely relaxed now!
  182: I'd better get aligned before we take off.
  183: Ooh! The Star Father! The Star Father!
  184: I'm all aflutter for the take-off!
  185: How soon do we leave?
  186: I'll bet the high AHS's aren't this jittery.
  187: Wow... the stars. At last.
  188: I won't have to wear a tinfoil hat anymore!
fcfempnk:
  100: You see a female punk.
  101: You see a female punk.
  102: You see a fairly pretty, cynical young woman.
  103: I'll bet my boyfriend offered to share me.
  104: Sometimes I get sick of traveling.
  105: It sure would be nice to live here.
  106: I'll bet we could make a hell of a scene.
  107: Have you been west across the water?
  108: I'd flirt with you, but I'm just not interested.
  109: "::sarcasm:: Sure are a lot of strong women around here, huh?"
  110: You expect me to roll over for you? Get real.
  111: I'm unique! Just like everyone else!
  112: Sometimes world-weary cynicism bores me.
  113: Next time, I want to find a tribe of goths.
  114: I hear the Shi Emperor is inhumanly smart.
  115: These Shi sure look funny.
  116: I'm open-minded, huh?
  117: Look at all these new punks. Posers.
  118: AHS-9 cheated us and he'll cheat you too if you let him.
  119: Next bozo who calls me "bitch" is getting flash-fried.
  120: So how was it, taking it from a mutant?
  121: Did that big strong mutie Francis hurt you?
  122: I'm surprised you can walk after what Francis did.
  123: I'd guess you'd still be bleeding after Francis.
  124: I can't believe you wouldn't help Chip.
  125: Selfish bastard. I'll bet Chip would've helped you.
  126: Everyone liked Chip. Now no one likes you.
  127: You're quite the jerk, aren't you?
  128: Ever think about anyone but yourself?
  129: Oh, look, it's the "hero".
  130: Hey, everyone! It's the selfish asshole!
  131: Oh, you again? Like anyone wants to talk to you now.
  132: Chip-hater!
  133: Too bad about the spleen.
  134: I'll bet someone ate Chip's liver.
  135: I wonder if Chip will ever be okay again.
  136: I think Chip's the best!
  137: Even if he has no spleen, I'd do Chip in a second!
  138: Thank you for trying to get Chip's spleen back.
  139: You did your best for Chip.
  140: Here's another platitude about Chip.
  141: I wonder if the spleen tasted good?
  142: Yay! Now I can have Chip AND his spleen!
  143: I'm going to go see Chip right now!
  144: Chip's the best!
  145: I like you. You're a good one.
  146: I'm so happy for Chip.
  147: Chip's a whole man now.
  148: You want to have a good time with Chip and me?
  149: You did good with Chip's spleen.
  150: How very selfless of you!
  151: Suze is back! Good!
  152: Suze is back...Damn!
  153: Suze was always really cool to me.
  154: I like Suze.
  155: Thanks for saving her.
  156: Some people need to learn not to wander.
  157: Who knows?
  158: Poor Badger. Maybe he needs someone to comfort him.
  159: I'd better make sure Badger's okay.
  160: Badger's cute, but he's no dreamboat.
  161: I wonder why Badger farts and belches so much.
  162: Badger probably farts because he's sad.
  163: Poor Badger.
  164: It's a tough old world we live in.
  165: Suze should've known better.
  166: If you're taking the boat, we ought to be leaving it.
  167: Sorry about the state the boat's in.
  168: So you'll be taking the ship, eh?
  169: The PMV Valdez is a good vessel - it was a good home.
  170: Time to pack my stuff, I guess.
  171: Enjoy the boat.
  172: Good luck finding your people.
  173: I'll just be going now.
  174: I hope we can find another place to live.
  175: Poor Badger. He was a real cutie.
  176: Who'd want to kill Badger?
  177: Badger smelled funny but I liked him.
  178: I heard Badger was gay, but then he got a girlfriend.
  179: I always thought Badger was abusive, but in a cute way.
  180: I'll bet Badger is showing this off to his friends.
  181: 'Badger... ::sniff::'
  182: Badger was a real fairy-tale princess.
  183: You asshole. Why'd you kill him?
  184: You think we're going to join the Hubologists now?
  185: You stupid, stupid pawn.
  186: The Hubologists are going to cheat you, too.
  187: You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
  188: I hate you.
  189: You suck.
  190: Sheepie sheepie sheep!
  191: Crazy cultist!
  192: Some people are just naturally stupid, I guess.
  193: Hey! It's the idiot who can't think for itself!
fcgudpea:
  100: You see a person in funny pajamas.
  101: You see a Shi townsperson.
  102: This person looks different from anyone you've seen before. They don't seem
    to care much about you.
  103: You're not a spy, are you?
  104: Who are you?
  105: Fish and seaweed. That's all we get.
  106: Ha ha! Look at the funny round-eyes!
  107: You look like a Hubologist.
  108: Leave us in peace.
  109: Long live the Dragon!
  110: Down with Lo Pan!
  111: The Dragon is a hero.
  112: Look out for Lo Pan. He's trouble.
  113: Those punks are always so loud.
  114: 'Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::'
  115: Isn't there more to life than this?
  116: We're smarter than you think.
  117: Look! A lao wai!
  118: I don't think I like you.
  119: You scare me.
  120: Don't hurt me, please.
  121: I'll bet Lo Pan would like you.
  122: Please don't cause trouble.
  123: I like life. I won't do anything to lose it.
  124: The wastes are getting scarier.
  125: Sir... yes, sir... goodbye, sir.
  126: Ha ha! That bastard Lo Pan is dead!
  127: You've helped us!
  128: Lo Pan is dead!
  129: Now for the Hubologists!
  130: Look at the funny round-eyes!
  131: You look like a Hubologist.
  132: Leave us in peace.
  133: Long live the Dragon!
  134: Long live the Emperor!
  135: 'Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::'
  136: Isn't there more to life than this?
  137: The Dragon... is dead...
  138: Oh no! The Dragon is dead!
  139: Life has no meaning.
  140: We shall survive... barely.
  141: Who will be our hero now?
  142: And with the Dragon go our dreams.
  143: There's no point.
  144: Let us teach our children to be like the Dragon.
  145: We must make new dreams now.
  146: The Emperor's mouthpiece! Dead!
  147: What happens now?
  148: I hope the savages don't overrun us now!
  149: The good always die young.
  150: I hope we can survive the winter without Ken Lee.
  151: I hear that Ken Lee was the only one who kept the Emperor in line.
  152: 'I hear that the Emperor was only a faзade for Ken Lee. '
  153: 'Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::'
  154: Isn't there more to life than this?
  155: We're smarter than you think.
  156: Look! An outsider!
  164: You killed AHS-9? Good job!
  165: Those Hubologists give me the creeps.
  166: Honored visitor, you have done us a great service.
  167: Death to the Hubologists!
  168: Maybe this will hurry those Hubologists out of here.
  169: Stupid Hubologists, can't even protect their own leader.
  170: I just hope the Hubologists don't come after us in revenge.
  171: I guess you're not a spy after all.
  172: Son of a pig! Die!
  173: You have dishonored your family!
  174: Leave us alone, lao wai!
  175: Haven't you done enough damage?
  176: I hate you!
  177: Leave this city!
  178: Go home to your people!
  179: Do not darken my life with your face!
  180: What will it take to get rid of you?
  181: Help! Help!
fcgunmer:
  100: You see an enthusiastic Shi.
  101: You see Mai Da Chiang, the owner of Red 888 Guns.
  102: This is a rotund Shi who looks like he's running on permanent overdrive.
  103: Hi! Welcome to Red 888 Guns! I'm Mai Da Chiang, the owner. How can I help you?
  104: Grokken di ma!
  105: Me buy!
  106: I was looking for some weaponry.
  107: Tell me about the place.
  108: Forget it.
  109: I'm sorry! I don't speak your language! Have a nice day!
  110: Rrr?
  111: Ahh, a weapon, eh? Well, this is what I have.
  112: "-more-"
  113: Great, great. Thank you for your business. Come back soon!
  114: More questions!
  115: Bye!
  116: No. Is not good enough. So sorry. Something else perhaps?
  117: More questions.
  118: No. Bye
  119: You need something else?
  120: Me buy!
  121: No. Bye.
  122: I was looking for some weaponry.
  123: Tell me about the place.
  124: Forget it.
  125: We have lived here for years, but we did not always live here. Dr. Fung knows
    the complete history. I'll bet what you're looking for is what we do now.
  126: Yep.
  127: No, actually, I wanted to know the history. I'll go find Fung. See you.
  128: Now, we are mainly fishermen and scientists. Our fishermen catch fish. Our
    scientists are working on a project that they say will change the world.
  129: Change the world how?
  130: What else is happening in town?
  131: Hmm. Interesting. I have more questions.
  132: Thanks. Bye.
  133: I do not know. They keep their secrets to themselves.
  134: I see. What else is happening in town?
  135: I see. I have more questions.
  136: Thanks. Bye.
  137: We have two rivals of martial arts in town. They are Lo Pan, a lover of self,
    and the Dragon, who loves others. It is said that whoever wins will determine
    the future of martial arts.
  138: I see. Anything else in town?
  139: I see. I have more questions.
  140: Thanks.
  141: There is a gang of vagrants who have moved onto the Poseidon Oil tanker on
    the wharf. There were monsters living inside it, but the vagrants have sealed
    them into the lower hull. Though they are outsiders, we are grateful to the drifters
    for this task.
  142: Any other news?
  143: I see. I have more questions.
  144: Thanks. Bye.
  145: The scientists report that someone has broken through their computer security
    and stolen our secrets.
  146: Any other news?
  147: I see. I have more questions.
  148: Thanks. Bye.
  149: That is all I can think of at the moment. Good day.
  150: Good day.
  151: You are a thief, a murderer, and a villain. I'm afraid I must kill you.
fcjuavki:
  100: You see an eerily wholesome couple.
  101: You see Juan Cruz and Vikki Goldman, two of New Reno's more notorious film
    stars.
  102: You see a dark-haired man and a blonde woman, both of whom are extremely attractive.
    They exude a slutty "come-hither" vibe.
  103: 'Him: Hi! I''m Juan Cruz! Her: And I''m Vikki Goldman! Both: We''re celebrities!
    And we endorse Hubology! Both: Please note that any similarities between us and
    people or  institutions, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.'
  104: Ah? Cluz? Doldnin?
  105: Celebrities? What makes you celebrities?
  106: Similarities? What do you mean?
  107: I want to be a Hubologist. How do I join?
  108: Hey, Vikki, Dave H. is in love with you.
  109: Great. Gotta go.
  110: 'Him: A poor child of the waste. Her: Perhaps an alignment would help? Him:
    Yes. You. Would you like an alignment?'
  111: "'Es!"
  112: No!
  113: 'Her: I do hope that has helped. Good luck in your travels!'
  114: Goo-bye!
  115: It certainly has!
  116: 'Him: If you won''t accept our help... Her: ... then we can''t help you. Goodbye.'
  117: Bye!
  118: 'Him: Ah, you see? The teachings of the Hub have demonstrated their worth again!'
  119: I have some questions.
  120: Thanks! Bye!
  121: 'Her: Why, we were in the movie business in New Reno. We made hundreds of films,
    many of them classics, like "Top Bun," "Frisky Bizness," and "Days of Rubber".  That''s
    what makes us celebrities.'
  122: 'Him: But then, as a member of the industry, you already knew that.'
  123: It's nice to finally put faces to the names.
  124: Who cares if YOU endorse it? Shouldn't I make my own choices?
  125: I see. Well, I have more questions for you.
  126: Thanks, bye.
  127: 'Her: Oh, yes, you should definitely make your own choices. Him: And with the
    Hub''s latest book, you can learn how to make the RIGHT choice!'
  128: His latest book? Isn't he dead?
  129: The "right" choice. Sure. What about free will?
  130: Sounds great. How do I join?
  131: Sure. I have more questions.
  132: Right. Bye.
  133: 'Him: More questions? Then we have the answers! Provided by the Great Wheel''s
    graces, of course.'
  134: How do I join?
  135: What makes you celebrities?
  136: Shouldn't I make my own choices, rather than let celebrities guide me?
  137: How do I join?
  138: Hey, Vikki, Dave H. is in love with you.
  139: No, no more questions.
  140: 'Her: [blank icy look] Him: Thank you.'
  141: Err... I have some questions.
  142: That's all for me! So long!
  143: 'Him: Dead? Ha ha! Perhaps. We like to think that he aligned all his neurodynes
    and went to join the Star Father. Her: We have extensive use of his jotted notes
    and barely-begun manuscripts to spread the word of the Hub. Him: For example,
    we found a scrap that said: "2 doz. eggs/Milk/TP". Obviously this is significant.
    It needs to be heard.'
  144: Err... right. I have more questions.
  145: What, because some crackpot wrote something down you feel the need to publish
    EVERYTHING?
  146: Yes! Praise the Hub! I see the light! How do I join?
  147: Right. Bye.
  148: 'Him: Yes. Some might think we resemble certain people. Her: But the truth
    is, it''s entirely coincidental.'
  149: Whew. Well, that's a load off. Say, I have more questions.
  150: Got it. So long.
  151: 'Her: Of course you have your free will. You have the choice to allow your
    neurodynes to be filled with the filth of the world. Him: You have the choice
    to live a joyless, meaningless existence in the rat race. Both: Or you can come
    to a greater understanding of life through the Great Wheel.'
  152: Neurodynes? What are they?
  153: Sounds great. How can I join?
  154: Hmm. I think I'll stick with the rat race.
  155: Right-o. Well, I have to run.
  156: 'Her: You dare call the Hub (praise his vision) a crackpot? Here? In a stronghold
    devoted to his study? Him: Get out of here. If you talk to anyone on the way out,
    you will be attacked. Infidel. Both: Good riddance.'
  157: Maybe I'd better jump on them. I always hated your movies anyway. Let's see
    you do a death scene.
  158: Your movies suck. Bye.
  159: Bye.
  160: 'Her: Neurodynes are the essence of souls destroyed in the Great War, polluting
    your spiritual essence and guiding you astray. Him: If you want to know more about
    our teachings, you''ll have to join our church.'
  161: Yes, this sounds fascinating.
  162: I'd heard this was science fiction, but I didn't know how much. The Hub must
    have been quite a crackpot.
  163: Well, I'm definitely curious about what you've got. Count me in.
  164: Hmm. Nah, not right now. I do have more questions, though.
  165: Umm... gotta go. Bye.
  166: 'Him: That''s very forward-thinking of you. Her: Very enlightened. Him: We
    offer our opinions to people - and if our celebrity can attract more believers,
    we''re anxious to use it.'
  167: I have other questions.
  168: I'm interested in joining.
  169: I see. Well, so long.
  170: 'Him: Well, it''s very simple. We just give you this informational holodisc.
    Her: ... you sit through a short movie... Him... and then you go talk to AHS-7!
    Her: Easy, isn''t it?'
  171: Let's do it.
  172: I don't think I'm ready for this.
  173: 'Her: That''s your prerogative. Him: And I hope you''ll understand that you
    can''t be allowed to wander our base. Her: So you had better leave - the guards
    will probably shoot at you if you stick around.'
  174: Gee, thanks. Invite me in to recruit me and shoot me if I don't sign up? Nice
    gig.
  175: Maybe I'd better shoot you first.
  176: I'm out of here.
  177: 'Him: This is your last chance to change your mind. Her: We''d hate to see
    anything bad happen to you.'
  178: Screw you.
  179: Fine. How do I join?
  180: Something bad is about to happen to YOU.
  181: Nope. I'll take my chances. So long.
  182: 'Him: We''ve done everything we can for you. Her: Good luck in your travels.'
  183: Bye!
  184: 'Her: Dave? The computer guy? Him: Ha ha! What a loser! Vikki is mine, all
    mine - no way he''ll... excuse me, this is negative energy I''m channeling. I
    must have fouled my neurodynes. Her: [whispers to you] I think Dave''s a cutie,
    but nothing can happen while Juan is around. Him: Whew. Neurodyne is all clear
    again.'
  185: Well, I have more questions.
  186: That's all. Bye.
  187: 'Her: That wasn''t so bad, was it? Him: Now just go talk to AHS-7 and we''ll
    be comrades in Hubology! Her: I''m so excited! Him: Getting new recruits makes
    me horny. Her: Oh, honey... Him: Oh, baby...'
  188: I'll just come back later.
  189: 'Him: Too bad. Her: You''re committed now.'
  190: "-done-"
  191: 'Him: You made a life-altering decision. Her: And sadly, it was the wrong one.
    Both: Guards! Guards!'
  192: Damn.
  193: 'Him: Greetings,'
  194: So what do I do now that I'm an Hubologist?
  195: How can I hook up with you guys?
  196: That's pretty much all I wanted. So long!
  197: "[]"
  198: "[]"
  199: 'Him: You could talk to Harry Rocket on the surface. Maybe he needs some help.
    Her: Or you could talk to AHS-7 or AHS-9. They usually have ideas. Him: Or you
    could watch the PrayScreen. Her: Or you could cause mischief among the enemies
    of the Wheel.'
  200: Thanks. How do I hook up with you guys?
  201: Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.
  202: 'Her: As sad as it is - because the Star Father knows you''re a cutie - we
    probably shouldn''t. Him: But we''re both flattered! Her: Maybe sometime we can
    all go to New Reno and make a film together.'
  203: Oh, all right. What else is there to do as an Hubologist?
  204: Oh, all right. So long.
  205: 'Her: Lying is bad for your neurodynes. Him: That''s right. Her: That''s why
    I have to be honest and say I don''t find you attractive. Him: But we still love
    you as a fellow follower of the Hub!'
  206: Gee, thanks. So what else is there to do as an Hubologist?
  207: Whatever. [mutter] jerks.
  208: Greetings, new recruits!
  209: I'm Vikki Goldman!
  210: And I'm Juan Cruz!
  211: We're celebrities, as you already know.
  212: We think Hubology is the way to go.
  213: We KNOW Hubology is the way to go.
  214: I can fry bugs with my brain power!
  215: I look good in tinfoil hats!
  216: Maybe if you work hard at optimizing yourself, you can associate with us.
  217: We'd certainly like that.
  218: Yes. We're always looking for friends...
  219: "... as long as they are willing to optimize themselves."
  220: And are as high ranking as we are.
  221: We're AHS-5.
  222: You can be AHS-5 someday.
  223: If you donate lots of money, you can be AHS-5 even faster.
  224: But don't think we only want you for the money.
  225: No, we want to HELP you.
  226: And that's what Hubology is all about.
  227: "[applause]"
  228: ". I hope your enlightenment is going well. Her: We do have such... large...
    hopes for you."
  229: 'Lesson 1: Here we have eternity, the Great Wheel. [points at something] And
    here is where we are. [points at something] Now all we have to do is walk really
    far and meet our starry brethren there.'
  230: Man, we're going to need a lot of shoes.
  231: 'Him: Now just go talk to AHS-7 and we''ll be comrades in Hubology! Her: I''m
    so excited! Him: Getting new recruits makes me horny. Her: Oh, honey... Him: Oh,
    baby...'
fckenlee:
  100: You see a stocky Shi man who looks like he's full of knowledge.
  101: You see Ken Lee, advisor to the Emperor.
  102: You see a stocky Shi man waring glasses and a half-smile.
  103: What would you like, friend?
  104: What do you want?
  105: What can I do for you?
  106: You?
  107: Who are you?
  108: What is this place?
  109: I'm looking for some lost villagers.
  110: I am in need of fuel.
  111: I would like to speak to the Emperor.
  112: The Hubologists have assigned me to kill the Emperor.
  113: Nothing. Thanks. Bye.
  114: 'I am Ken Lee, advisor to the Emperor.  And you, my friend, appear to be simpleminded,
    so remember this: if you seek the Enclave, then you must take the Poseidon tanker
    to it. You''ll need fuel for the tanker. You have my blessing.'
  115: Tanks!
  116: I am Ken Lee. I am the advisor to the Emperor. The Emperor advises me not to
    talk to you, and so I will not. Good day, fool.
  117: Grrr!
  118: Ahh, traveler, I cannot help you. Perhaps you can find the answer to your quest
    in another way. Good day.
  119: Dood day!
  120: I am Ken Lee. I am the advisor to the Emperor of the Shi. I bring forth the
    wisdom of the Emperor. And who are you?
  121: I'd like to see the Emperor.
  122: I am
  123: You sound like an overgrown flunky to me.
  124: No one important. Goodbye.
  125: This is the Steel Palace of the Emperor. This is the heart of Shi-town.
  126: And where is the Emperor?
  127: What sort of research do you do here?
  128: What's the history of the place?
  129: I see. So long.
  130: If you wish to see the Emperor then you must give me your own name.
  131: Oh. Right. I'm
  132: Sure. My name is
  133: Yes.
  134: Forget it.
  135: Not everyone is granted a chance to see the Emperor. You must first prove your
    worth. Are you willing to prove yours?
  136: Yes.
  137: No. I've had enough tests in the last several months to last me a lifetime.
  138: I do not believe the Emperor would like to see you. I have been told to forbid
    entrance to those who offend me or who reek of evil. You do both, traveler. Good
    day.
  139: "-done-"
  140: Insults will get you nowhere, traveler, except removed from the Steel Palace.
    Kindly control your tongue.
  141: Make me.
  142: Fine.
  143: The Emperor remains hidden from prying eyes. As my job is to act as the Emperor's
    screen, I cannot and will not tell you where he is.
  144: Fine. I have more questions.
  145: Fine. Bye.
  146: 'We do research that will change the world. For more answers to your questions,
    you should seek out Dr. Wong Yi Tze. '
  147: I will. And I have more questions.
  148: I will. Bye.
  149: We were the survivors from the wreck of a submarine.  When we ran aground,
    we stripped the metal from the submarine to create the Palace. Some do not believe
    this.
  150: Hm. It sounds almost as if you're berating someone.
  151: I see. Thanks. Bye.
  152: Ah, yes! I have seen some of your movies. Yet surely this is not your real
    name?
  153: Sure it is.
  154: No. My real name is
  155: It's all the name you need, old man.
  156: That will be quite impossible. Good day.
  157: "-done-"
  158: Surely you must give me more credit than that. I know how the "biz" works.
    I have traveled to New Reno before.
  159: Okay, my name is
  160: That's my real name! Now let me talk to the Emperor!
  161: 'Excellent. This is what I require of you: there is a small military base north
    of here, called Navarro. There are numerous vertibirds there. We need plans and
    blueprints to manufacture some of our own. Fetch those and you will be on your
    way to seeing the Emperor.'
  162: You got it.
  163: Forget it.
  164: Will you reconsider taking our test?
  165: Nope.
  166: Oh, all right. I'll do it.
  167: Lost villagers? I have heard nothing of this. Perhaps the Emperor would know
    of them.
  168: I have more questions.
  169: Thanks. I'll do that.
  170: 'You must complete a second test: the Hubologists are our enemies. Their leader,
    AHS-9, has been abducting and brainwashing our children. Kill him for the good
    of the Shi and I shall tell you how to speak to the Emperor.'
  171: He's as good as dead.
  172: No, I don't think so.
  173: No? It saddens me, but I understand. Best of luck in your quest. If you change
    your mind, you know where to reach me.
  174: Sure do. I have more questions.
  175: Yep. Bye.
  176: I am anxious to see the result of your attempt. Good day.
  177: Good day.
  178: Berating someone? Any fool who had done their research can see that the very
    basis of Shi-town is the wreckage of this submarine. It seems fruitless to argue
    with those who would say there is no submarine.
  179: That's very even-tempered of you.
  180: It certainly is. And I deal with these people on a daily basis. Alas!
  181: Well, I have more questions.
  182: Yeah, poor you. Bye.
  183: You are certainly a worthy recipient of our fuel. I believe I can trust you
    with our secrets. In the back room, you will find the forcefield to the large
    computer has been turned off.  Enter the password "CSPDMSHR-Shih-huang-ti-X9372"
    and you will find yourself connected to the Emperor Computer.  The Emperor will
    be able to direct our fuel to where you need it.
  184: Thanks.
  185: Guards! The enemy is among us! Guards!
  186: 'Have they really? Perhaps you would like to turn the tables on them? I can
    promise you our aid if you will agree to kill AHS-9. '
  187: He's as good as dead.
  188: No.
  189: Excellent. I hope to hear of your success soon.
  190: You will. I have more questions.
  191: You will. Bye.
  192: Then in that case, you can only be an enemy. Good day.
  193: Good day.
  194: With the death of AHS-9, the Great and Terrible, the Hubologists pose no real
    threat to us and our researches. Well done. You have our gratitude. Would you
    like to speak to the Emperor?
  195: Yes.
  196: Not right now. I have other questions, though.
  197: You have proven yourself to be a friend to the Shi. I believe I can trust you
    with our secrets. In the back room, you will find the forcefield to the large
    computer has been turned off.  Enter the password "CSPDMSHR-Shih-huang-ti-X9372"
    and you will find yourself connected to the Emperor Computer. I hope this will
    prove useful to you.
  198: The Emperor is a COMPUTER?
  199: Got it. Thanks.
  200: Yes. It stores our history, our research, and projects possibilities for the
    future. It is far better than any fallible human- yet we temper its suggestions
    with our own knowledge of human nature.
  201: I ... see. Well, thanks for your time. I have a village to rescue.
  202: Our spies report that you have given the vertibird plans to the Hubologists.
    Steal them for us and you shall be rewarded.
  203: You got it. I have some questions.
  204: No way.
  205: Thank you for the vertibird plans, traveler. What can I do for you?
  206: I have questions.
  207: Um... Nothing.
  208: Once you have obtained the vertibird plans, give them to Dr. Wong Yi Tze. He
    will put them to good use.
  209: Okay. I have other questions.
  210: Okay. Bye.
  211: ". I'd like to see the Emperor."
  212: "."
  213: Remember, you must take the plans to Dr. Wong Yi Tze.
  214: You are back to insult me again.  I think not.
  215: As I have explained, I will need to know your name.
  216: 'All right, it''s '
  217: Forget it, you idiot!
  218: Remember, the Emperor awaits the death of AHS-9.
  219: I am sorry.  But I cannot offer what fuel we have to you.  Perhaps if you were
    to speak to the Emperor?
  220: How do I do that?
  221: Can I just ask another question?
  222: I wish I were able to offer you our fuel, but unfortunately our stores are
    empty.  They have been diverted by some means to the Hubologists.  It is possible
    that you would be able to find someone to divert it back.
  223: Can I see the Emperor now?
  224: I respectfully remind you that unless you have given the vertibird plans to
    Dr. Wong Yi Tze, I can not grant you access to the Emperor.  I hope you understand.
  500: Leave immediately, or I will call the guards.
  501: Leave now. This is your second warning.
  502: This is your last warning.
fclaocho:
  100: You see a man who looks much like a shopkeeper.
  101: You see Lao Chou, the shopkeeper.
  102: You see a man in functional, comfortable clothing.
  103: Greetings! Welcome to my shop, Flying Dragon 8.
  104: What can I do for you?
  105: Da aggle oo!
  106: Stuff!
  107: Who are you?
  108: I'm looking for some equipment.
  109: I'm looking for some information.
  110: Bye.
  111: You want to buy something?
  112: "::nod head::"
  113: "::shake head::"
  114: This is what we have, then.
  115: "- end -"
  116: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can do for you. Good day.
  117: "-done-"
  118: I'm Lao Chou. I run this establishment, Flying Dragon 8, a general store. I
    have been known to trade in... information.
  119: What sort of information?
  120: I see. I'd like some equipment.
  121: Little happens in this town that I do not know about. Of course, you must know
    the right question to ask, yes? What do you need to know?
  122: I'm looking for some upgrades to my equipment.
  123: Where can I find vertibird plans?
  124: I need to find fuel for the PMV Valdez.
  125: I understand I need a FOB to access the Valdez' computer.
  126: I need some computer parts for the PMV Valdez.
  127: I'm looking for a spleen.
  128: I hear some flying machines brought a load of villagers down this way.
  129: Nothing. Bye.
  130: Talk to Crocket, over in the Hubologist camp. He is their head scientist.
  131: Thanks. I want more information.
  132: Thanks. Bye.
  133: Look to the north, in Navarro. There is a hidden base near the gas station.
  134: Thanks. I want more information.
  135: Thanks. Bye.
  136: Have you tried looking in the old Vaults? I hear that they are a wealth of
    information and technology of the ancients.
  137: Thanks. I want more information.
  138: Thanks. Bye.
  139: A spleen? Ha ha! Yes, Chip from the Valdez lost his spleen in a card game the
    other day. I sold it to Dr. Wong.  He was fascinated by it.
  140: Dr. Wong? Where can I find him?
  141: How do you lose a spleen?
  142: Thanks. I have more questions.
  143: Ah, so. Bye.
  144: Dr. Wong is the head scientist in the Steel Palace. Seek him there.
  145: How do you lose a spleen, incidentally?
  146: Thanks. I want more information.
  147: Thanks. Bye.
  148: He was drunk. Very, very drunk. He was obsessed with his spleen all night long.
    And then he bet it.
  149: So you took his SPLEEN?
  150: I see. Well, I have more questions.
  151: Yes. It was a debt. He is an honorable man.
  152: I see. I need more information.
  153: You're a sick, rude bastard, aren't you?
  154: Right. Bye.
  155: You are a dishonorable person. I will not have you in my shop. Come back some
    other time.
  156: Whatever.
  157: They did not. They came from the north and flew over us, heading out over the
    sea.
  158: Over the horizon? How the hell do I get there?
  159: Yeah, right they did. Tell me where they are before I open you like a can of
    sardines.
  160: Well... none of our boats are capable of that kind of distance.  Unless...
  161: Unless...?
  162: Thanks for your "help". I'm going to get me some real advice.
  163: "... unless you can get the old tanker on the docks working. It's an old ship,
    but probably still functional, if some work is put into it. Ask the punks for
    more information."
  164: Thanks. I want more information.
  165: Thanks. Bye.
  166: Word has it that the Hubologists have come into a large quantity of fuel recently.
    Bargain with them.
  167: Thanks. I want more information.
  168: Thanks. Bye.
  169: You might try some of the Shi scientists in the Steel Palace. Perhaps they
    can help you with your fuel needs.
  170: Thanks. I want more information.
  171: Thanks. Bye.
  172: You are an enemy of my people. Die!
  173: You have performed well for my people in slaying AHS-9. I hope that I can be
    of assistance to you in some way.
  174: Who are you?
  175: I'm looking for some equipment.
  176: I'm looking for some information.
  177: Bye.
  178: You have already given them to the Hubologists. No?
  179: Oh yeah...ah...Can I ask something else?
  180: Oh yeah...Bye.
fclogrd:
  100: You see a guard in loose clothing, wearing a look of wary boredom.
  101: You see a Palace Guard.
  102: You see a Palace Guard.
  103: Just keep moving along and there'll be no problem.
  104: You have business here?
  105: We're keeping an eye on you.
  106: Don't try anything funny.
  107: Treat our people with respect.
  108: Don't touch that and that's your last warning.
  109: Keep away from there.
  110: Step back, lao wai, or I'll fill you with so much metal you'll clank when you
    walk.
  111: Step slowly away from that. Make a move for your weapons and you're dead.
  112: Don't even think about that.
  113: Stop that. NOW.
  114: Die, enemy of the people!
  115: I'm sending you to the hell of burning metal!
  116: May the Buddha have mercy on your spirit!
  117: Suffer, foe!
fclopan:
  100: You see an arrogant Shi gangster.
  101: You see Lo Pan, a domineering, ruthless man.
  102: You see a Shi gangster, dressed in silken clothing. His hands are calloused
    and hard. He seems dangerous and poisonous.
  103: What do you want?
  104: Daggle aggle aggle!
  105: Who you?
  106: Who was that you were fighting?
  107: Who are you?
  108: I want to learn to fight like you. Teach me.
  109: I wish to challenge you.
  110: Forget it.
  111: Get out of here, idiot. I don't have anything to say to you.
  112: GRR!
  113: I'm Lo Pan. I'm the best fighter in town, except for the Dragon. And one day,
    he's a dead man. When that happens, I'll teach others my style.
  114: Teach me!
  115: Tank yu.
  116: You want to learn? Do you have what it takes? Let's see.
  117: "-done-"
  118: Teach you? I don't think so. You look far too self-righteous. Get out of here.
  119: What the... ?
  120: Oh, look, the idiot. I don't want to talk to you. Go away.
  121: Duhhh...
  122: Him? The Dragon. He's a weakling who fosters weakness.
  123: The people are sheep. You should serve yourself.
  124: What, you're evil?
  125: I see. I have more questions.
  126: Evil? Hardly. Just smart. Maybe if you're so concerned about doing the right
    thing by people, you should see the Dragon. He likes simpering weaklings like
    you.
  127: "-done-"
  128: Yes, I should. And I do. Unfortunately, the Dragon stands in the way. We're
    too evenly balanced in our fight against each other. I need just one trained person
    to help me.
  129: I am that person.
  130: I see. Well, I have more questions.
  131: I see. Well, so long.
  132: Are you? Can you fight a man hand to hand, foot to face, without relying on
    armor and weapons?
  133: I can, but why should I?
  134: Sounds fair to me. How does this test work?
  135: Oh. Well, in that case, I gotta go.
  136: Because otherwise the peasants will curse me and it'll make it that much harder
    to cow them when I've beaten the Dragon.
  137: Got it. Let's start the test.
  138: Got it. I have more questions.
  139: Riiight. See ya.
  140: You want to fight me to the death, or do you just want to see who's better?
  141: To the finish. I can take you.
  142: A test of skills. I don't want to kill you.
  143: Neither. Forget it.
  144: Great. I hope you have a grave ready. Did the Dragon send you?
  145: Yes. I'm doing this for the Shi.
  146: No. I'm doing this because I think you're scum.
  147: A tough one, eh? You'll fight my men first, and then we'll see if you're worthy
    of fighting me.
  148: "-begin-"
  149: I'm Lo Pan. I'm also the "sworn enemy" of the Dragon. Why he insists on having
    a sworn enemy is beyond me. I just fight as well as him, and I think he's weak-hearted
    and allows others to live under his shadow. We're enemies because we have the
    same fighting style, and whoever wins will be the one who carries the tradition.
  150: I'm not too bad at hand-to-hand combat myself. Wanna give me a try?
  151: That's interesting. Must be rewarding. I have more questions.
  152: Thanks. Bye.
  153: I may be a scumbag, but never will it be said I don't stand up for my people.
    I'm going to hurt you before you die.
  154: "-done-"
  155: Then you're a fool and a dog doing the bidding of others. I will laugh when
    you die.
  156: "- attack now, with armor and weapons -"
  157: "- enter the ring, remove armor and weapons, and fight hand to hand -"
  158: Good. At least you're your own master. Are you tough enough to fight without
    weapons or armor?
  159: "- attack now, with armor and weapons -"
  160: "- enter the ring, remove armor and weapons, and fight hand to hand -"
  161: Baaa, sheep, baaa! Go back to your robed masters. I don't have anything to
    say to you.
  162: "-done-"
  163: Didn't I tell you to talk to the Dragon about your moral qualms? He'll hold
    your hand. I won't. Now leave.
  164: "-done-"
  165: You are, I must admit, even better a fighter than I am. You wanna try for the
    Dragon?
  166: Yes. I'll do it right now.
  167: It's not really my fight.
  168: Sure, but I have some questions.
  169: No, it's not. But the Dragon still beats me. If you have any backbone, you'll
    take him out. But then, I never expected pride from a lao wai.
  170: Right. I have questions.
  171: Yeah, whatever. Bye.
  172: I just got back from killing a lao wai who tried to steal our secrets. The
    Dragon and I took him out. We worked well together, I must admit.
  173: Great. I have questions.
  174: Great. Bye.
  175: The Dragon is dead. I don't believe it. At least now we won't have those pesky
    traditions dogging our every step. Thanks.
  176: Great. I have questions.
  177: Great. Bye.
  200: Lo Pan detects your advance and you slip by him.
  201: Look, I don't appreciate anyone taking my things, so go steal someone else's.
    Leave now.
  202: I warned you to leave, not to die. Oh well.
  203: You already took the test of the Dragon!
  204: I am done training today. Return tommorow.
  205: I am Master Khung, your final test.
  206: I am Imbot. Be ready.
  207: I am Wejungh. Prepare yourself.
  208: I am Loopal. You will get no further.
  209: I am Smitty. It is your time to be beaten.
  210: I am Master Krall. You are finished.
  211: FIGHT!
  212: You need to train more.
  213: Prepare yourself!
  214: You have beaten Lo Pan in mortal combat. For some reason the sun seems a little
    brighter today.
  215: You have already defeated my men. You have passed my test. You are ready to
    fight the Dragon.
  216: You're pretty good already. Go learn to shoot or something.
  217: Let us begin. Follow my lead.
  218: Training is done for the day.
  219: You have learned well.
  220: You have already defeated my men. No others wish to challenge you.
  221: You have helped me and did not even know it. With the Dragon dead I no longer
    have to follow those outdated moral traditions.
  222: It was my pleasure. Bye.
  223: You're welcome. Bye bye.
  224: You're welcome. Can I ask a question?
  225: Welcome. Me ask?
  226: You WIN!
  227: You LOSE!
  228: Next Opponent!
  229: Hey, look I what I found.
  230: First, you will need to prove you can do it.  I will have you go up against
    five of my fighters - one at a time.  If you beat them then you will receive your
    final test.
  231: What is that?
  232: Sounds like too much trouble. Bye.
  233: You will need to defeat me.  However, none of these battles will to be to the
    death -  to protect my men, of course. [he sneers]
  234: Let's get it on!
  235: You can take care of the Dragon yourself.
  236: "[Lo Pan studies you and then throws a quick punch which smacks you in the
    nose before you can even react.] You are not good enough."
  237: Ok, but can I ask something else?
  238: Fine. Bye.
fcmalpnk:
  100: You see a male tanker vagrant.
  101: You see a male punk.
  102: You see a fairly handsome, cynical man wearing tattered clothing.
  103: Nothing's on.
  104: I'm sick of fish.
  105: The sooner we move on, the better.
  106: The best thing about being a nomad is self-control.
  107: In fact, I'd rather die than give you control.
  108: No one runs my life! I'm the king of me!
  109: I'm my own boss.
  110: I'm unique! Just like everyone else!
  111: Sometimes world-weary cynicism bores me.
  112: Next time, I want to find a tribe of goths.
  113: I saw Selmy and Barro torn apart downstairs.
  114: I hear the Shi Emperor is inhumanly smart.
  115: These Shi sure look funny.
  116: I'm open-minded, huh?
  117: I'll share my girlfriend if you'll share yours.
  118: Look at all these new punks. Posers.
  119: AHS-9 cheated us and he'll cheat you too if you let him.
  120: Sheep. You're nothing but a killing sheep.
  121: Tell those bastard Hubologists we'll never come over.
  122: Ain't never going over to the Hub.
  123: Hope you're proud of yourself.
  124: Won't they ever realize killing our "leader" won't make us follow theirs?
  125: You're an asshole.
  126: Baah! Baah!
  127: So how was it, taking it from a mutant?
  128: Did that big strong mutie Francis hurt you?
  129: Francis play with you?
  130: Francis is a pretty big guy.
  131: Big ol' Francis, huh?
  132: "[]"
  133: Hey! It's the gimp!
  134: Hey, if you need any help from us, don't bother asking.
  135: Wow! A talking asshole!
  136: You pull anything being such a jerk?
  137: Sacrifice our li'l Chippie, will you?
  138: Poor Chip.
  139: Oh, look, it's the "hero".
  140: Hey, everyone! It's the selfish asshole!
  141: Like anyone wants to talk to you now.
  142: Chip-hater!
  143: Can I do anything for you? Too bad!
  144: Don't talk to me.
  145: Nice of you to try for Chip's spleen.
  146: At least you tried.
  147: Poor Chip.
  148: Tough break for ol' Chippie.
  149: Chip's getting weaker. Too bad.
  150: Good going with the spleen!
  151: Wow... a hero AND a spleen-finder.
  152: Didn't know they made spleens.
  153: Thanks for saving Chip.
  154: Hey there, Chip lover!
  155: We're all happy for Chip.
  156: Thanks for saving Chip.
  157: Now Badger will be easier to live with.
  158: I always did like Suze. Glad she's not dead.
  159: I wonder if Suze will nanny for my kids?
  160: Kill the monsters, save the girlfriend... Is there any hero shit you don't
    do?
  161: Can you save my girlfriend too? Ha ha!
  162: Maybe Badger will sleep with you for saving his girlfriend.
  163: I'll bet Badger's really happy now.
  164: Maybe you ought to ask Badger for some favors.
  165: Poor Badger. Poor Suze.
  166: I warned her not to go down there...
  167: "... damn hold-monsters..."
  168: I feel really sorry for Badger now.
  169: Death on the ship. Poor Suze.
  170: Man... is life going to get any better?
  171: It's dangerous down there!
  172: Geez... why'd she go down there?
  173: We ought to seal off the hold.
  174: Let's get off the ship.
  175: You gonna take the tanker out west?
  176: Guess it's about to time to abandon ship.
  177: I'm about ready to move out of here.
  178: I got my shit all packed up.
  179: Don't think I want to be heading west.
  180: "[]"
  181: "[]"
  182: "[]"
  183: Know any good places to settle down?
  184: I'll make sure the place is clean before I go.
  185: Let's get the show on the road!
  186: Geez... no more Badger.
  187: Who would've killed him?
  188: I don't know shit about computers. Do you?
  189: Man... Badger knew all the cool places to go.
  190: Now I'll never hear his band play!
  191: Stupid killers... getting rid of Badger... stupid.
  192: I am so full of hate right now.
  193: I want revenge for Badger!
  194: Life seems so pointless without Badger.
fcmarc:
  100: You see a friendly-looking punk.
  101: You see Marc.
  102: You see a friendly-looking punk.
  103: You son of a bitch - how could you do this to us?
  104: What can I do for ya, mama-jamma?
  105: What can I do ya for, mama-jamma?
  106: Ooh! Ooh! Aah!
  107: Who are you?
  108: What is this place?
  109: Who's in charge?
  110: Nothing. Bye.
  111: Hmm. Nope, sorry, can't help you with that. Maybe you should try someone else.
  112: Anks?
  113: 'I''m Marc. I''m the resident smart-ass and know-it-all.  ::he smiles::'
  114: Oh. I have other questions.
  115: Bye.
  116: This is the Poseidon Marine Vessel Valdez - also called the PMV Valdez. If
    you want more information about the Valdez, the best person to ask is the Captain.
  117: The Captain? Who's that?
  118: I have other questions.
  119: Bye.
  120: In charge? No one's in charge of us.
  121: Where'd you all come from?
  122: I have other questions to ask you, then.
  123: Bye.
  124: The Captain is a tough-ass ol' military guy. He sits upstairs there and checks
    the place out. He's got some thorough knowledge about this ship.
  125: Thanks. I have more questions.
  126: Thanks. Bye.
  127: Oh, all over the wasteland. We'd heard things about San Francisco, passed down
    from our elders. Some of us have ancestors who used to live here before the great
    war.  You want to hear more?
  128: Yes.
  129: No, but I wanted to ask you something else.
  130: No, that's all.
  131: We're a band of musicians, tekheads, geeks, and artists. We thought we'd come
    back to someplace famous for artistic and personal freedom. I came here to spawn.
    Wanna hear more still?
  132: Yes.
  133: No, but I wanted to ask you something else.
  134: No, that's all.
  135: Well, when we got here, we figured we'd camp out here until we either figured
    out how to get this tanker moving again or until we thought of something else.
  136: Have you figured out how to move the tanker?
  137: Tell me about the Hubologists.
  138: Tell me about the Shi.
  139: I have other questions.
  140: Thanks. Bye.
  141: I think the Captain's figured out how to do it - but we need several elements
    first. We've basically given up on taking it for ourselves, to tell the truth
    - we've got other plans now.
  142: What are they?
  143: Where can I find the Captain?
  144: I wanted to ask something else.
  145: Bye.
  146: They're crazy. Don't trust them - unless you're mentally feeble or like being
    screwed over. They're interested only in your money and your soul, and there's
    a good chance they'll destroy the one to get at the other. I've seen it happen
    too many times.
  147: Have you figured out to move the tanker?
  148: Tell me about the Shi.
  149: I have other questions.
  150: Bye.
  151: They're a good sort, as far as they go. They're a little untrusting of outsiders,
    but then, that's not always such a bad attitude to take in these times. They've
    got some weird customs and they talk funny, but they're all right.
  152: Have you figured out to move the tanker?
  153: Tell me about the Hubologists.
  154: I have other questions.
  155: Bye.
  156: You want to know what our plans are? We're going to keep moving around until
    we can find a place that hasn't been screwed over by human greed and then we're
    going to try to set up a better society.
  157: Do you know how you're going to do that?
  158: I have other questions.
  159: Thanks. Bye.
  160: We're hoping that if we can avoid society's mistakes. Hell, things can't get
    much worse.
  161: Have you figured out to move the tanker?
  162: Tell me about the Hubologists.
  163: Tell me about the Shi.
  164: I have other questions.
  165: Thanks. Bye.
  166: You seen Badger's girlfriend around?
  167: I think I saw her go down below. There's a hole on the north side of this deck.

  102: You see an animated Shi merchant. Like all the others, he seems to be full
    of wind.

  136: Shi-Town will never be the same without old Ken Lee.

  138: Hey! Hey! Buy this! Buy this!

fcoz7:
  100: You see a cowled Hubologist. Somehow, this one seems different.
  101: You see AHS-7, the second in command.
  102: You see a cowled Hubologist.
  103: Guards! An oppressive! Strike it down!
  104: You. State your business.
  105: Aaagh! Nu! Nee!
  106: I have a letter for AHS-9 from the Enlightened One in NCR.
  107: I'm here to speak to Crocket about some armor.
  108: I'd like to look around.
  109: I'm interested in potentially joining your group.
  110: Who are you?
  111: I've come to kill you all.
  112: Ah, poor child. Would you like to be aligned?
  113: "'Es!"
  114: No!
  115: Poor child. Already aligned, yet unable to articulate. Go on in.
  116: "'Ank yu!"
  117: Go in and find Juan and Vikki. They can help you. Good luck, child.
  118: "'Ank yu!"
  119: "::his voice hardens:: Then I see no reason you should be admitted here. Good
    day."
  120: "'Ey!"
  121: Very well. Be quick, though - he's a busy, busy man.
  122: Okay.
  123: This is not a place that is open for random tours. Good day.
  124: "-done-"
  125: Excellent! Go in, go in. Speak to Juan Cruz and Vikki Goldman - they're celebrities,
    you know, but they'll talk to YOU.
  126: Who are they?
  127: Ooh! Celebrities!
  128: 'I am AHS-7, the second in command of this facility.  Before you ask: AHS stands
    for Aligned Hub Seeker, which means that I have cleared seven levels of neurodynes
    from my spirit. This means that I am more enlightened and closer to the hub of
    the Great Wheel than you. And this means that you will tell me what you want here.
    Now.'
  129: I have a letter for AHS-9 from the Enlightened One in NCR.
  130: I'm here to speak to Crocket about some armor.
  131: I'd like to look around.
  132: I'm interested in potentially joining your group.
  133: I've come to kill you all.
  134: They're stars from New Reno. They heard the truth behind our gospel and came
    to cleanse their neurodynes.
  135: Where do I find them?
  136: Well, forget it. I'm out of here.
  137: You can find them in the prayer room, showing all our new recruits and the
    raw meat just how rewarding it is to be a Hubologist.
  138: Well, let me at 'em!
  139: I'll be the judge of that. Let's get the show on the road.
  140: Forget it. I'm out of here.
  141: So now you've spoken to Juan and Vikki. Are you interested in joining our friends
    in the search for enlightenment to the Great Wheel?
  142: Oh yes. Yes yes yes.
  143: Sure.
  144: Not right now. Can I get back to  you?
  145: I don't think it's my bag. Sorry.
  146: Hell no. Your crazy cult deserves to be torched down to the ground.
  147: "::he smiles:: You won't regret this. You may have the run of the compound.
    Oh... you're a person who knows how to use a weapon. Would you care to use yours
    in the service of the Great Wheel?"
  148: Yes.
  149: Maybe later.
  150: Do not wait too long before returning with a reply. Your neurodynes will be
    filled with more and more pollution until we can begin the cleansing process.
  151: I changed my mind. I'll join.
  152: You got it. Talk to you later.
  153: You may leave this compound safely, traveler, but I would recommend not returning.
    If you do not travel with us, then you work against us - and I would hate to see
    you hurt.
  154: Thanks for the concern. See you.
  155: I don't think I'd be the one hurt. So long.
  156: Torch us? TORCH US? GUARDS! KILL THE UNBELIEVER!
  157: "-done-"
  158: So. You have now had time to reconsider your decision. Will you join us?
  159: Yes.
  160: No.
  161: I still need more time.
  162: You do not have more time. Make your choice, meat.
  163: Fine, I'll join.
  164: Forget it. I don't like strong-arm tactics.
  165: The oppressive Shi have been contesting our power and wreaking havoc among
    our brethren with their neurodyne-influencing ways. We believe that if their Emperor
    is killed, they will see the error of their ways. Will you kill the Emperor?
  166: Yeah, I'll do it.
  167: No, the Shi have never done anything to me.
  168: Perhaps you will reconsider. Let me know if you do. Now, is there anything
    the Hub can provide for you, recruit?
  169: Yes, I have some questions.
  170: No, not right now, thanks.
  171: Have you thought on aiding us in our struggle against the oppresive Shi? The
    Star Father will bless you if you take part in our crusade.
  172: I still am not sure I want to do it.
  173: I'll do it.
  174: Perhaps I can ease your troubled soul. What do you need?
  175: Where can I get fuel for the Poseidon tanker?
  176: Where can I find the meaning of all the terms you use?
  177: When does the ship take off?
  178: Where is Crocket?
  179: Nothing, thanks. Bye.
  180: Let us know when you have completed your task.
  181: Will do. I have more questions.
  182: Sure thing. Bye.
  183: Have you removed the Emperor's oppressive stain from this material existence?
  184: Not yet.
  185: Yes, AHS-7. He is dead.
  186: The de facto leader of the Tanker vagrants is a piece of anti-therapeutic raw
    meat named Badger. With his death, they will come to understand our position.
    Will you remove him?
  187: I'll do it.
  188: He hasn't done me any harm. I'd rather not.
  189: So... have you reconsidered whether you would remove this "Badger"?
  190: I'll do it.
  191: I'd still rather not.
  192: Have you removed this "Badger"?
  193: Not yet.
  194: Yes. He's gone.
  195: His people shall embrace the Hub! All will be well! You have performed a great
    service!
  196: Thanks! I have more questions.
  197: I do it all for the Wheel. Farewell.
  198: Actually, now I'm going to kill you too.
  199: Now that the ship is filled with fuel, we await only the word of AHS-9 the
    Great and Terrible to achieve liftoff.
  200: Sure we will. I have some questions.
  201: Thanks. Bye.
  202: Aside from the precious fuel we need to launch ourselves into the bosom of
    our starry brethren on the planet Quetzel, I can't think of a place. Perhaps the
    Shi?
  203: Huh. I have more questions.
  204: Yeah, maybe.
  205: I understand the Shi have a massive tank of fuel. Maybe you can steal it from
    them.
  206: That's an idea. I have more questions.
  207: Maybe. Thanks.
  208: Simply use the holodisc Juan and Vikki provided to you and check out the Glossary.
  209: Thanks. More questions?
  210: Thanks.
  211: When AHS-9 receives his vision from the Hub, we will leave, and join him in
    celestial glory!
  212: Yeah, praise the Wheel or whatever. I have more questions.
  213: Most informative. Thanks.
  214: He's usually in his lab, working on ways to perfect our bodies and our spirits.
  215: Thanks. I wanted to ask something else.
  216: Thanks.
  217: Before you can truly be one of us, we must perform an initial zeta scan - an
    alignment. Are you prepared for your scan?
  218: No! No scan!
  219: Sure. Let's do it.
  220: Without a scan, you cannot join us. Are you sure you wish to refuse?
  221: Absolutely sure. I don't want to be monkeyed with by your machines.
  222: Oh, all right. Scan me.
  223: We have eliminated some of your dirtiest neurodynes. You are now rated as AHS-1.
    Are you ready to join our noble cause?
  224: Oh yes.
  225: Nope. Don't want to now.
  226: 'Lesson 1: Here we have eternity. Over here is where Quetzel is. [points at
    something] And here is where we are. [points at something] Now all we have to
    do is walk really far to get there.'
  227: Man, we're going to need a lot of shoes.
  228: Can I still think about it?
  229: You again? What?
  230: Is there anything else you need me to do?
  231: You are not wanted here. Please leave now.
fcoz9:
  100: You see a well-dressed man.
  101: You see AHS-9, the Great and Terrible.
  102: You see a well-dressed man.
  103: You blaspheme the Hub's name! You must die!
  104: Your perfidy knows no bounds!
  105: The Great Wheel will run you over!
  106: You are in the presence of AHS-9, the Great and Terrible. What is it you desire
    of him?
  107: Agh a nu, AHS!
  108: I'm looking for my people. I heard they came down this way in flying ships.
  109: I have many questions for you, AHS-9.
  110: The Enlightened One in NCR wanted me to deliver a letter. She said something
    about a reward?
  111: The Enlightened One in NCR wanted me to deliver a letter. Here you go.
  112: Oh, AHS-9, I come bearing a letter from your agent in NCR. I bow to your glory.
  113: Your death. Good bye, old man.
  114: Nothing, sorry.
  115: Yes, my child?
  116: Hinchoaf? [You can understand me?]
  117: Aagga diggle doodle doo! [Oh, thank goodness. I'm looking for my people. I
    need to get over the big water.]
  118: Poopy pants! [Well, thanks for your time. I have to be running along now. A
    pleasure talking to you.]
  119: I can't understand a word you're saying. Perhaps you should see Juan or Vikki
    about an alignment.
  120: Anks!
  121: Of course, child. The alignment has cleared your basic neurodynes and aligned
    them with mine and the spokes of the Great Wheel. What do you need?
  122: Aagga diggle doodle doo! [Oh, thank goodness. I'm looking for my people. I
    need to get over the big water.]
  123: B-b-b-enny [Nothing, thanks. It's just nice being able to talk to you. Bye!]
  124: If you'll agree to do me a favor, I can help you, child.
  125: Oik? [What is it? I'd be happy to be of assistance.]
  126: No!
  127: My counterpart, The Emperor of Shi-town, has been making my life miserable.
    I'd like you to end his. In return, I'll make sure you can get where you need
    to be.
  128: Ays! [I'll do it.]
  129: No!
  130: If you change your mind, let me know. Remember, I may be the only way you have
    of reaching your family.
  131: Ok. [What is this favor?]
  132: Didgeroo! [Thanks, I'd rather not owe anyone. So long!]
  133: Good. Let me know when you're done, and I'll begin making inquiries into ways
    we can achieve your goal at the same time. Farewell, child.
  134: D'bye! [So long, AHS-9. You're a great man.]
  135: Have you completed your task? Your future and that of the Wheel on this planet
    depend on it.
  136: Unh-uh [Not yet. I just wanted to say hi.]
  137: I'm working on it. I have some questions.
  138: Not yet. I'll get back to you.
  139: Greetings to you as well. Now, please finish your job so that I may aid you.
  140: Ng! Ng! [Yes, sir!]
  141: I can see by your emanations that you have succeeded in ridding the world of
    the polluting neurodynes of the Emperor.
  142: Jirsa! [Yes, I have. How is your part of the bargain coming along?]
  143: Yes, I have. Now I require your assistance in helping my people.
  144: If you go to Shi-town's docks, you will find the PMV Valdez. Enter the ship.
    Head to your right, and up to the captain's station. Hit the Go button, and the
    tanker will sail you to your destination.
  145: Anks! [It has been a pleasure, AHS-9. I wish you all the best. Good bye.]
  146: Flying ships? You must be referring to the Enclave and their vertibirds.
  147: Yeah, I guess so.
  148: Enclave? Enclave who?
  149: Trust me, child, you are referring to the Enclave.
  150: Yeah, okay. How do I find them?
  151: The Enclave are a remnant of the past - a neurodyne that has yet to be aligned.
    They have hidden bases all over the shards of old California, and their strongest
    stronghold is off to the west, over the waters.
  152: How do I get there?
  153: How do you know all this?
  154: That, my child, you will have to discover on your own. Ask around and you shall
    find the truth.
  155: Very helpful. I have more questions.
  156: How do you know all this?
  157: Whatever. Bye.
  158: Child, I am AHS-9.  I see many things that transpire in the fleshy world. Do
    you have more questions, or may I return to my meditations?
  159: More questions.
  160: Return to your meditations. I'm done.
  161: You have killed the Emperor and destroyed his minions?
  162: Yes, I have.
  163: Then there is no one who can stand in my way! But I see no need to be beholden
    to a mere tool. Farewell - and good riddance!
  164: Why, you scumbag. I'm going to kill you now.
  165: Oh. Well, if that's the way it's got to be. So long.
  166: A letter from the Enlightened One? Is that what she calls herself now? Bah.
    [he takes the letter from you] And she promised a reward? You have a reward -
    my gratitude. Good day.
  167: That's it? Old man, you're dead.
  168: Err, I had some questions.
  169: Gee, great. Bye.
  170: Address your questions to AHS-7. I am AHS-9, the Great and Terrible, and I
    have many matters on my mind. Trouble me not, meat.
  171: If you won't answer my questions, you'll answer my weapons.
  172: Whatever.
  173: Ahh, a letter from my field agent. Pity she calls herself "The Enlightened
    One" - it shows that she truly is not enlightened. You have my gratitude.
  174: No problem. I have a question or two, though.
  175: Great. Bye.
  176: Yes, my child?
  177: When does the spaceship take off?
  178: Do you have any tasks for me?
  179: Where does all the money we provide go?
  180: Oh, nothing. Forget it.
  181: My counterpart, The Emperor of Shi-town, has been making my life miserable.
    I'd like you to end his. In return, I'll make sure you can get where you need
    to be.
  182: Sure thing, boss. See ya.
  183: I'd rather not.
  184: Seek out Badger, whose caustic presence holds those  pathetic tanker vagrants
    together. Rid our fair city of him. When you have done so, visit AHS-7.
  185: Sure thing, boss. See ya.
  186: I'd rather not.
  187: I was not aware I had made it a request, child. Kill him!
  188: No.
  189: Oh, all right. I'll do it.
  190: You disobey the commands of AHS-9, the Great and Terrible? Then you shall die.
  191: Bring it on.
  192: Wait, I changed my mind.
  193: Too late, meat. You have shown you cannot be trusted. Die!
  194: "-done-"
  195: Child, there are some things you are not meant to know for now. [He smiles
    benignly.]
  196: All right. I have more questions.
  197: Hm. Bye.
  198: 'The ESS Quetzel will launch when the stars are right. '
  199: Right-o. I have more questions.
  200: Thanks. Bye.
  201: Your enburgled aura tells me that you come here meaning me no good. Tell me,
    child, do you wish to profit from your venture?
  202: Yes.
  203: No.
  204: No, I just want you to die.
  205: 'This, then, is my bargain: return to the Shi and eliminate Ken Lee and the
    Emperor. I will repay you with more money than you have ever dreamed.'
  206: No, I don't think so.
  207: You've got a deal, fat man.
  208: Then go and smite those troublesome souls. I await word of your success. [He
    smiles beatifically.]
  209: So long.
  210: No, wait, I changed my mind. I want you dead.
  211: Ah, child, how could you stray from the path of truth like this? I see from
    your aura that you plan to kill me. I am bitterly disappointed. Bitterly. Ah well.
    Let us proceed.
  212: Yes, let's. Die.
  213: Remember, you will need to visit AHS-7 when you have completed your task.
  214: All our needs have been met. Now it is time for me to meditate.
fcrocman:
  100: You see a harried-looking bald man.
  101: You see Harry, the rocket supervisor.
  102: You see a harried-looking bald man.
  103: Aiee! Enemies of enlightenment! Help! Guards!
  107: Hey! Raw meat! Who are you? What are you doing here?
  108: Duh?
  109: I have a letter for AHS-9. Where do I take it?
  110: I'm
  111: None of your business.
  112: I want to join the Hubologists.
  113: Who are YOU? And what are YOU doing here?
  114: Nothing. Bye.
  115: Great, an idiot. Look, pal, just go down those stairs there and maybe they
    can adjust your neurodynes and make something useful of you. Until then, though,
    I'm busy. Now go.
  116: Oh-tay!
  117: Take it downstairs. Show it to AHS-7, who has gate duty right now, and he'll
    take it for you or send you on to AHS-9. Now can I get back to work, meat?
  118: Sure.
  119: You're not one of the brethren, and you're therefore not authorized to be here.
    Unless you're planning on joining us - which you may do by expressing your interest
    to AHS-7, who is at the guard post.  Now, either get downstairs or get out of
    here.
  120: Fine, fine. No need to get testy.
  121: Actually, it is my business. This is my ship, and these are my guards - now,
    who are you and what are you doing here?
  122: I'm
  123: None of your business.
  124: I want to join the Hubologists.
  125: Who are YOU? And what are YOU doing here?
  126: Nothing. Bye.
  127: I am Harry. I am the chief rocket technician.
  128: I'm
  129: None of your business.
  130: I want to join the Hubologists.
  131: Nothing. Bye.
  132: Not willing to cooperate, eh? Guards! Kill this intruder!
  133: Your guards are dead men.
  134: Go down that elevator and talk to AHS-7 at the guard post. He'll direct you
    accordingly.
  135: Thanks. Bye.
  170: I am in need of help, child. Can you help me?
  171: I am still in need of help, child. Can you help me?
  172: Who are you?
  173: What are you doing here?
  174: I got a copy of the plans from the Shi.
  175: I have the plans for the bertibird.
  176: The Shi have the plans for the vertibird
  177: What can I do for you?
  178: Forget it. Bye.
  179: I am Harry, AHS-5. I am the starbrother in charge of the rocketship. We are
    going to use it to travel to Quetzel.
  180: Can I ask something else?
  181: Got it. Bye.
  182: What I'm doing is preparing the ship for the grand trip to the Star-Father.
    We're very close right now.
  183: Can I ask something else?
  184: Got it. Bye.
  185: You have the plans? Excellent! Now all we need is fuel! The Shi have a bunch.
    See if you can go route some to us. Good luck, recruit!
  186: "-done-"
  187: Then you must go get them, yes? Now please excuse me, comrade - I must continue
    readying the ship for our epic journey.
  188: I have the plans for the vertibird.
  189: Sure thing.
  190: We have all we need for our journey now! Excellent! Now we just await the word
    of AHS-9 - and I'm sure he'll want you to come with us. Go get whatever you need
    done - and then come back and join us with the Star Father!
  191: See ya then!
  192: First, we need vertibird plans to ensure that we've got the aerodynamics right.
    If you can do this, check with the Shi or go up that old base in Navarro.
  193: Remember, you are finding the plans for the vertibirds for us.  Either try
    the Shi or that old base in Navarro.
  194: No one has been able to get plans for the vertibirds from the Shi, or from
    that old base in Navarro.  Have you reconsidered helping us?
  195: Remember, recruit! The hated Shi have the plans.
  196: I have the plans for the vertibird.
  197: Forget it.
  198: Ok, I'll do it.
  199: Now you know what we need? Gas. A lot of it. The Shi have some. See if you
    can get it.
  200: Remember, you were getting us gas for our great spaceship.
  201: Oh, ok. Bye.
  161: ". I'm just looking around."
  162: ". I'm just looking around."
  163: ". I'm just looking around."
fcronmey:
  100: You see someone wearing a captain's hat.
  101: You see Captain A. Ron Meyers
  102: You see a punk in tattered clothes wearing a captain's hat.
  103: What the hell do you want? I don't speak to anyone unless they're friends or
    good people. Do something for one of my buddies and then come talk to me.
  104: "-done-"
  105: I heard what you did for my men. Thanks. What can I help you with?
  106: You who?
  107: I hear you're the one who knows all about this ship.
  108: Why do they call you the Captain?
  109: How do you get this thing to go?
  110: Nothing.
  111: I'm the Captain. I run the ship. Any more questions, go talk to one of the
    Shi or Badger or someone. I don't have time for you.
  112: "-done-"
  113: This ship's a Poseidon tanker. It's equipped with tech that lasted through
    the war. It's got a FOB that allows access to the navigation computer room, and
    it's got an IFF transponder that protects it from Poseidon guns.
  114: How do you know all this?
  115: What's an IFF transponder?
  116: How do you get it to go?
  117: Thanks. Bye.
  118: I used to serve with the Enclave. Then I realized it wasn't the USA I was fighting
    for; it was for the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.
    I deserted and now I live here with more honest people.
  119: More honest people? These guys?
  120: What exactly is the Enclave?
  121: How do you get this thing to go?
  122: Bye.
  123: 'How do you pilot this rig? Fill ''er up with some gas - try the Hubologists
    or the Shi after you''ve taken care of everything else - and press the button.
    The computer will take care of the rest, if it''s still working. It''ll sail right
    out to the oil rig, and they won''t fire at you because you''ve got the IFF transponder.
    Just make sure you''ve got what you need to access everything: FOB, working computer,
    and fuel. Easy enough, huh?'
  124: Sure. How do you know all this?
  125: What's an IFF transponder and a FOB?
  126: What oil rig?
  127: Yes. Bye.
  128: 'IFF: Identify Friend or Foe. It means that this ship is identified as a friend,
    so other Poseidon things - like, say, an oil rig - won''t fire at you when you
    come into range.  Oh, and a FOB is some sort of Enclave technology that let''s
    you enter a door electronically.  You''d probably find one of them at one of their
    bases or some such place.'
  129: How do you know all this?
  130: What oil rig?
  131: Thanks. Bye.
  132: Yes. With these people, you know exactly where you stand. They don't play games.
    The Enclave was like a pack of hyenas - they'd turn on you in a second.
  133: What exactly is the Enclave?
  134: How did you hook up with them?
  135: The Enclave is remnants of old times. If you take this thing across the water
    to the rig, you'll find out for yourself.
  136: How do I pilot it?
  137: What rig?
  138: Easy enough. I just left the Navarro base one day and headed down here. I figured
    it was the last place anyone would look. Besides, I'm not important enough for
    the Enclave to look for me - I'm just a loose end.
  139: What exactly is the Enclave?
  140: Thanks. Bye.
  141: There's a big Poseidon oil rig left out on the water. That's the final base
    of the Enclave, and unless I miss my bet, that's where your friends are, too.
  142: How do you know all this?
  143: What else is going on out there on the rig?
  144: Thanks. Bye.
  145: Word gets around.
  146: I see. What else is going on out there on the rig?
  147: I see. Bye.
  148: Beats me. I was a Navarro tech, not a rig operator. We talked to them over
    the comm lines, and that was about the extent of it.
  149: I see. How do I pilot this again?
  150: Thanks. Bye.
  151: You made a bad mistake messin' with the Captain and his friends...
  152: 'How do you pilot this rig? Well, I see you already gassed her up. When you''ve
    taken care of everthing else, just press the button. The computer will take care
    of the rest, if it''s still working. It''ll sail right out to the oil rig, and
    they won''t fire at you because you''ve got the IFF transponder. Just make sure
    you''ve got what you need to access everything: FOB, working computer, and fuel.
    Easy enough, huh?'
  153: Oh, yeah. You gotta get the navigation computer working as well.  I bet you'd
    find parts for it in one of those old vaults.
  154: Good to see you again. What do you need?
fcryan:
  100: You see a partially head-shaven punk.
  101: You see Ryan, Font of All Wisdom.
  102: You see a punk who has an air of cockiness and laughter about him.
  103: You gotta fight through that shit, man.
  104: This place is a shit hole.
  105: I'm gonna do you until you bleed. Sorry, was that out loud?
  106: Ay carumba! Nalgas con queso!
  107: Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
  108: I'm outta here.
  109: I knew Big Jesus Mordino when he was Baby Jesus.
  110: Jesus Mary Mother of God!
  111: I am a producer. I make games. Games are fun. Play my games.
  112: Buy flamers for flamers.
  113: They call me... THE POLISH HAMMER.
  114: I came to San Fran to make some games and kick some ass.
  115: Summer lovin'...
  116: Hola, senor! Or is it senorita?
  117: Tee hee!
  118: Man... this place is like a promise made in Stockton - all wind and no action.
  119: My friend Scott thought the capital of Old California was Stockton. Promise!
  120: I'd like to blow some hot goo on Chip.
  121: Dude!
  122: Awww, come ON!
  123: Aggro-suuuuuuuuuurge!
  124: Don't make me put the mosh face on.
  125: Yeah, right?
  126: Exactly, sir. Heh heh heh.
fcshigrd:
  100: You see a guard in loose clothing, wearing a look of wary boredom.
  101: You see a palace guard
  102: You see a palace guard carrying a dangerous-looking weapon.
  103: Just keep moving along and there'll be no problem.
  104: You have business here?
  105: We're keeping an eye on you.
  106: Don't try anything funny.
  107: Treat our people with respect.
  108: Don't touch that. That's your last warning.
  109: Keep away from there.
  110: Step back, outsider.
  111: Step slowly away from that.
  112: Don't even think about that.
  113: Stop that. Now.
  114: Die, enemy of the people!
  115: I'm sending you to the hell of burning metal!
  116: May the Buddha have mercy on your spirit!
  117: Suffer, foe!
fcskids:
  100: You see a kid.
  101: A child.
  102: This kid looks much like other kids.
  103: You look mean.
  104: Don't hurt me, 'kay?
  105: What's wrong with your eyes?
  106: Is that a lao wai?
  107: What are you?
  108: Does anyone like you?
  109: You're not going to hurt my mommy and daddy, are you?
  110: I'm going to go play now.
  111: Ha ha! Four eyes!
  112: Dork alert! Dork alert!
  113: "::the kid's eyes widen as Marcus marches past::"
  114: That's a big green mister.
  115: Why is that man wearing a skirt?
  116: Does that man want to be a girlie?
  117: Eeek! Tribal!
  118: Hey, mister! You have a bone in your nose!
  119: Eeeek! A zombie!
  120: Mommy, is that man contagious?
  121: Cute doggy! Good boy!
  122: Eeeee! A monster!
  123: Lookit the dorky tagalong!
  124: Is that your mommy?

    surrounded by monsters. Good thing you came along.

    far from the sea.  I used to be a nanny, but then the kids mutated into monsters.
  122: I have more questions.
  123: How'd you meet Badger?

    tank and relax.
  191: Okay.
  192: The requested procedure has been completed. Please exit the suspension tank.
  193: Thanks.
  194: Please state your question.
  195: You computer?
  196: What you know about Enclave?
  197: What you know about Brotherhood?
  198: No more question.
  199: You are a computer, aren't you?
  200: What do you know about the Enclave?
  201: What do you know about the Brotherhood?
  202: I have no more questions at this time.
  203: I am ACE, an Artificial Conscious Entity. I am more than machine but not as
    highly developed as a true artificial intelligence.
  204: Uh... What artificial intelligence?
  205: Is a true AI possible or are you the state of the art at this time?
  206: It is a machine with the same free will and sense of  'I am' that a human has.
  207: Can be done? Machine think human?
  208: A true artificial intelligence is possible. A few such systems were completed
    for military purposes. The project was discontinued.
  209: Why?
  210: The suicide rate among true artificial intelligence machines was extremely
    high. When given full sensory capability the machines became depressed over their
    inability to go out into the world and experience it. When deprived of full sensory
    input the machines began to develop severe mental disorders similar to those among
    humans who are forced to endure sensory deprivation. The few machines that survived
    these difficulties became incredibly bored and began to create situations in the
    outside world for their amusement. It is theorized by some that this was the cause
    of the war that nearly destroyed mankind.
  211: Uh... How you feel?
  212: Me change subject
  213: Hmmm. So tell me, Ace. How do you feel?
  214: It's time to change the jubject.
  215: I... I sometimes think that I understand the feeling you call loneliness. I
    find it very... disconcerting. I...
  216: Me sorry. We talk other thing.
  217: I'm sorry, Ace. Let's change the subject.
  218: Outward appearances suggest that the Enclave is nothing more than a military
    organization. However, their level of technology indicates that they have access
    to advanced manufacturing techniques and research facilities. Such facilities
    would normally only be available to government agencies. This would suggest that
    the Enclave is the remains of the local or federal government that was in effect
    before the war.
  219: Ok.
  220: That's interesting.
  221: The Brotherhood of Steel is a paramilitary organization dedicated to the salvation
    of mankind through the proper use of technology. All other information is classified.

  228: Is that so?
  229: The Chosen One has come, and he will rid the world of your evil.
  230: I care nothing for your pathetic prophecies. Worse, you have become a nusiance
    through your meddling. That ends today!
  231: Killing me will stop nothing.
  232: That may be, but seeing your body rotting on the ground will bring a smile
    to my face.
  233: What do you think you're doing now?
  234: HA HA HA! You pathetic fool! HA HA HA!
  235: Wow, I haven't laughed like that for a while. Anyway, get ready to die.
  236: "...peep..."
  237: Well, it's a little past 12. Anyone up for lunch?

  102: You see a very old but still spry-looking ghoul.
  103: I gotta tell ya, ol’ Harold’s a bit slow on the draw hisself. The two of us
    talkin’ wouldn’t get a whole lot done.
  104: Ahh, ain’t you cute.  I just don’t have time to try understanding ya right
    now.
  105: 'Heh heh, ain’t you a kick. '
  106: Hello there, smoothskin. The name’s Harold. I help keep this town running.
  107: Whatcha need, youngster?
  108: Well, golly-be-damned, smoothskin. You did us a great favor helping out our
    power plant. The name’s Harold. I keep this town running.
  109: Mighty kind o' ya helping us out with the atomic power plant. We’re in your
    debt. Now, what can this cranky-old carcass do for ya?
  110: 'You are somethin''. Just like the original. What can old Harold do for ya,
    Vault Dweller? '
  111: Haven’t you done enough harm, smoothskin? What do you want now?
  112: Smoothskin? Why did you call me that?
  113: Vault Dweller? I’m not a Vault Dweller.
  114: Hello, Harold. What do you do here?
  115: Is there someplace I can barter or re-supply here?
  116: Is that a tree growing out of your head?
  117: You must know if there’s something called a Garden of Eden Creation kit here.
  118: Harold, I’d like to know where I can get some healing.
  119: I know you’re probably still mad, but you mentioned the Master. My ancestor
    killed him.
  120: Hello, Harold. Just passing through. Goodbye.
  121: Wha-whatever it takes to keep this place together. Better job on it than me.
  122: This place is coming apart?
  123: You don’t sound so good.
  124: Yep, but I’m doing great for being dead! I never get tired of the looks when
    I tell that one.
  125: Ahh, right....So you say the place is falling apart?
  126: Dead, you say? Well, in that case you’re doing great. So good you can answer
    my next question.
  127: Well, sorta. Our atomic reactor’s a mite...sensitive. The people I got running
    it mean well, but... well, they are not the sharpest tools in the shed. If you
    know what I mean.
  128: Well, we’re doing better now you’ve fixed our reactor. I’d never thought anybody’d
    get those idjits in Vault City to help us out.
  129: You know, it’s not so bad now. You fix the power plant, then you get the info
    we need to make it good-as-new. Golly-be-damned, ain’t you somethin'?!
  130: What do you mean?
  131: I didn’t want to see Vault City destroy your town.
  132: Well, I didn’t want to see Vault City destroy your town. Besides it was in
    their best interest to fix your power plant as well.
  133: Well, since it’s in Vault City’s best interest to fix up your reactor, it wasn’t
    too hard to get the Optimization info from them.
  134: I don’t like to complete any job only half-way.
  135: Well, I’d love to stay and chat with you but I’ve got things to do and places
    to go. Good luck.
  136: Well, technically... it’s a thingie.
  137: Okay, what does it do?
  138: Need a little time on the whetstone yourself, huh? I mean they are not too
    bright. Here’s an example. The other day I get a report. On it, it says the main
    coolant valve should be shut down. That woulda caused a meltdown that would make
    the Grand Canyon look like a pig wallow.
  139: That sounds bad.
  140: Uh, yeah, that would be bad. Now, I got things fixed up in time, but we came
    close to the end there. They need someone to watch out for ‘em.
  141: Good thing you’re here to help them.
  142: Who’d a thought I’d be making things right?  Although if we don’t get a Hydroelectric
    Magnetosphere Regulator pretty damn quick, there is gonna be trouble.
  143: What the hell is Hydra-magna-whateveraltor?
  144: Hmm, sounds like a real problem all right. Let me ask you something else.
  145: Trouble? What kind of trouble?
  146: Well, I’ve taken enough of your valuable time. Goodbye.
  147: Heck, if it weren’t for you, them damn idjits in Vault City woulda laid us
    out for the big dirt nap.
  148: I couldn’t let Vault City kill all of you.
  149: Happy to help out, Harold. Let me ask you about something else, though.
  150: Mighty kind a'ya. Not many smoothskins would do that for a town full of ghouls.
    Kinda reminds me of a smoothie I knew, way back when.
  151: You know, you’re a lot like the Vault Dweller.
  152: Another smoothie? What do you mean?
  153: Thanks. I’m hoping to live up to my ancestor. Let me ask you something else
    while I'm here that might help.
  154: Happy to help. Let me ask you about something else though.
  155: Well, all in a day’s work really. I need to be going now, though. People to
    save, monsters to slay, disasters to avert, you know, all that sort of thing.
    Goodbye.
  156: 'You cut with the dull edge of the knife, don’t ya?  You don’t look like an
    orange peel left in the sun all day. Your skin’s still soft and purty. '
  157: Got me there. I’ll try to make my next question a little more worthwhile.
  158: Oh. Yeah. Hey, let me ask you something else.
  159: You just better not be getting any funny ideas about my soft skin.
  160: Uh, well, I better be going. Goodbye.
  161: Funny ideas? Well, you mean like skinning you alive with a rusty, dull, old
    knife and then grafting your still-warm, wet, glistening, oh-so-soft, skin over
    my crusty-rotten gook?
  162: Hey! You just keep the hell away from me. I’m getting out of here while I still
    have my skin!
  163: Yeah, that’s exactly what I meant. Good call.
  164: Well, you don’t have anything to worry about....can’t find my knife.
  165: How ‘bout I change the subject with another question?
  166: Well, you just better keep your grubby mitts off my skin. Goodbye.
  167: More skin! ... Need more skin! (chuckles) What happ'n? Drop your sense of humor
    in the dust on the way into town?
  168: I’ve got a lot on my mind, all right? I need some more information.
  169: I think I’ll go look for it. Goodbye.
  170: I just let a big fart and it still doesn’t cover your stink. Why don’t you
    just drift outta here?
  171: Okay, but first I wanted to apologize for the way I acted earlier.
  172: Put a sock in it ya smelly old ghoul. Goodbye.
  173: That’s a start, but you’re gonna have to do better.
  174: I don’t know what else to say. I guess I just don’t deal well with things that
    are new to me. I am sorry, though.
  175: Okay, how ‘bout this? If I had jerky that looked half as bad as you do I’d
    burn it just to keep from poisoning any scavengers that might happen upon it.
    Bye.
  176: 'Well, alright. But you’d better stop being a bonehead. '
  177: Well, I tell ya youngster. Nice try but yer still an idjit. Maybe this’ll be
    the lesson you need. You are outta here.
  178: I’m sorry. Now that we’ve got that settled. Let me ask you something.
  179: Okay, goodbye.
  180: 'I’d rather look like this than look like you and have to be you. You are a
    bonehead. Get the hell outta here. '
  181: You’re like that bad booger ya can’t shake off your finger. But I’m still shaking....
    Oh look, there ya go!
  182: Well, look what the wind pooped in. My favorite turd. Why don’tcha just squish
    on outta here?
  183: Wanna know how to keep an idjit in suspense?
  184: Hey, I was hoping you’d show up. You won a prize for bein' the biggest jerk.
    There’s a party in your honor ten miles north of town. Better hurry.
  185: Their best interest? What do you mean?
  186: Well, according to some economic data I got hold of Vault City is much better
    off if they help you to repair your power plant.
  187: I mean, it’s always better to try to get along with others.
  188: Uh, nothing.
  189: Wow, it’s much later than I thought it was. I better be going. Goodbye.
  190: Economic data? You didn’t give them that information th-that Gordon keeps flapping
    his yap about, did you?
  191: Uh, yes I did. Why?
  192: Uh, no, of course not.
  193: Yeah, well, I’m sure some bonehead, very much like yourself, said the same
    thing about the Master.
  194: Sounds like a great story. Wish I had time to hear it but I gotta go.
  195: The Master? My ancestor killed him!
  196: Nothing, huh? I’m not buyin' it. You just put us in a bind. Why don’t you skidaddle
    while I thinka what to do.
  197: Uh, sorry.
  198: Yeah, sure. Why don’t you just do that. Geez, try to help some people....
  199: Why?! Now Vault City knows just how much we need uranium ore from Broken Hills.
    They could cut off them shipments and we’d be finished.
  200: Oh, it can’t be as bad as all that. They seemed like reasonable people to me.
  201: I didn’t know that was what they’d use the information for. I’m sorry. Goodbye.
  202: Well, I sure hope not. Those idjits in Vault City hate ghouls. They’d cut off
    our ore shipments from Broken Hills in a white-hot minute. Then they’d set the
    terms. Wouldn’t be long until Gecko’d be a slave camp.
  203: Oh, I’m sure they wouldn’t do that. They seem pretty reasonable.
  204: Well, it’s a good thing I didn’t tell them anything like that then. Heh, heh.
    Hey, let me ask you something else.
  205: Well, shit happens. Sometimes it happens to you. Goodbye.
  206: Reasonable? Reasonable! Well, I’m sure people said the Master was reasonable,
    too. What a bonehead. Get the hell out. Now!
  207: Maybe they have the right idea. Maybe it’s time to put an end to freaks like
    you. Goodbye.
  208: Uh, well, I uh, that is. Goodbye.
  209: 'Well, you might try talking to Wooz over in the Harp. You can’t miss it -
    it’s just across the way. '
  210: Thanks. Let me ask you something else.
  211: Thanks, that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  212: Jealous? His name’s Herbert. I talk to him when I get lonely... Heh heh. Just
    kiddin'... His name’s Bob.
  213: Right...Well, maybe you or Bob will know the answer to this.
  214: Thanks, that’s way more than I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  215: 'A Garden of Eden Creation Kit? A GECK, right? I seem to remember Vaults had
    those. Don’t know where you’d find one today. '
  216: Thanks. Let me ask you something else.
  217: Thanks, that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  218: Just talk to my assistant, Lenny. He’ll be able to fix ya right up.
  219: Thanks. Let me ask you something else.
  220: Thanks, that’s all I need to know for now. Goodbye.
  221: Another smoothskin. Had a lot of respect for that one.
  222: Who was that?
  223: 'Well, I could probably remember if I wasn’t dead. I never get tired of that
    joke. '
  224: Maybe you don’t...
  225: Well, to be honest, can’t remember the name. But they wore a funny suit. Kinda
    like the one you’re wearing.
  226: I’m wearing the Vault Suit that my ancestor wore. It’s a totem of my holy quest.
  227: Oh, this old thing?
  228: No lie?
  229: I’m wearing the Vault Suit that my ancestor wore. It’s a totem of my holy quest.
  230: No lie, Harold.
  231: That so? Well, well, well. That explains a thing or two. I wondered why you
    looked familiar. I’m not losing the last coupla marbles I got left.
  232: We really look alike?
  233: Tell me what the Vault Dweller was like.
  234: 'Yea, it looked just like that. Come to think of it, it had a 13 on it too. '
  235: Actually, this is the suit of my ancestor, the Vault Dweller.
  236: There is a resemblance. Near as I can remember, anyways. You know, your ancestor
    saved the whole darn lot of us.
  237: The Vault Dweller saved all of the ghouls?
  238: Thanks. It’s nice to know. Look, I have to run off for a bit. I’ll see you
    later.
  239: 'Jumpin’ to conclusions, youngster. That’s gonna get your ass shot off someday.
    All of us. Saved every two-legged-shuffler on the dang planet. '
  240: I didn’t realize that.
  241: I think I’ve heard enough for now. Goodbye.
  242: Well. Now ya do. And what happened next? For a thank you, the damn high-and-mighty
    Vaulties booted the Vault Dweller out. I always wondered what happened after that.
  243: I can tell you what happened.
  244: Enough reminiscing let me ask you something else.
  245: Well, I’d sure like to hear that.
  246: The legend of the Vault Dweller starts with the Vault casting him out into
    the dry Wastes.... [You tell Harold the story of your ancestor]…and so that’s
    why I’m looking for Vault 13 now.
  247: Thanks for telling. I sure was curious all these years. You sure got your work
    cut out for ya. Huh, ya know....
  248: Know what?
  249: I’ve taken enough of your time already. I better be going. Goodbye.
  250: Well, I been saving these for a rainy day, but it sounds like you're gonna
    need'em more than I ever will. Here, take these.
  251: I was gonna give you some healing supplies but damn me if I didn’t do that
    already. I tell you, gettin’ old’s hell on the memory.
  252: Thanks. Let me ask you about something though.
  253: Thanks for everything. I better be going though. Goodbye.
  254: Without a functional Hydroelectric Magnetosphere Regulator we’re leaking radioactive
    coolant into the groundwater. Now that means, anyone using that water is not gunna
    need a night-light to take a midnight piss. Also, we need more fuel because our
    power plant is not burnin’ it very efficiently.
  255: 'We need a Hydroelectric Magnetosphere Regulator and it needs to be installed
    soon or we have got some real problems. '
  256: Sounds bad. Where would you get a Hydro magnetosomething-or-other?
  257: What happens if you don’t get the part?
  258: Who do you buy your fuel from?
  259: Sorry to hear it. Let me ask you about something else.
  260: I think I’m going to have to leave you to your troubles for right now. Goodbye.
  261: Well, I’m certain those ornery bastards in Vault City have one. Not that they’d
    share. Hell, even if we had one of those thingies, I’m not so certain Festus could
    install the dang thing.
  262: Vault City wouldn’t give you the part? Even if it means that the groundwater
    won’t be polluted anymore?
  263: Sounds like you’ve got a lot on your mind. Goodbye.
  264: If we don’t get it, you can bet those boneheads from Vault City will shut down
    our power plant, permanently.
  265: What will you do then?
  266: We get our fuel from the Broken Hills. That’s a mining community some ways
    south.
  267: Interesting. Where would you get one of those Hydro magnetosomething-or-others?
  268: What happens if you don’t get that Hydro-part?
  269: Hmm, I think I should let you figure this out on your own. Goodbye.
  270: Take dirt naps. Vault City doesn’t play nice. They’ll just come up here and
    kill all of us if we don’t get that part. Well, at least I’ll have a tree for
    a monument.
  271: What was the name of that part again?
  272: Sounds like you need that Hydro-thingy pretty badly. Let me ask you something
    else right now, though.
  273: Sounds like trouble. I need to run off and see what I can do. Bye.
  274: Well, they’d only help us if they thought it was in their own best interest
    to do so. Huh. Not much chance of that happening.
  275: Hmm, you may be right. Still if someone could convince them that they should
    help you….
  276: They shoot ghouls on sight. Makes conversation a bit tricky.
  277: I wonder if someone else could tell them.
  278: Yes, it would. Right now I’ve got another question.
  279: Hey, you never know. I’ll see you later.
  280: To the north
  281: To the northwest
  282: To the wWest
  283: To the southwest
  284: To the south
  285: To the southeast
  286: To the east of here
  287: To the northeast
  288: I don’t understand.
  289: I don’t know.
  290: That hurts.
  291: That really hurts.
  292: That’s got to hurt.
  293: I don’t know anything about that.
  294: 'Yes'
  295: 'No'
  296: Why do you talk to me this way?
  297: You’re not nice.
  298: 'Thank you. '
  299: This is good.
  300: This isn’t good.
  301: I have a good feeling about this.
  302: I have a bad feeling about this.
  303: These people are crazy.
  304: I didn’t learn anything.
  305: I learned something
  306: Is everyone else crazy here?
  307: There must be another way.
  308: Follow me.
  309: Try this.
  310: Come here.
  311: I’m scared.
  312: I’m worried.
  313: I found something.
  314: I got lucky.
  315: You need to fix this.
  316: You need to turn this on.
  317: You need to unlock this.
  318: You need to open this.
  319: Maybe we should come back here.

  104: Uh, it’s working just fine. I can see you.
  105: It’s broken.
  106: We’re working on the visual link right now. I just wanted to test it.

  109: Uh, we’re all fine here. How are you?
  110: This is caau, rit, sss, pu-, -ear me. Over.
  111: I’m the Chosen One, so you just better watch your language.
  112: This is Unit Three reporting in.
  113: Well, your unit still doesn’t appear to be operational, Pal. Who is this?
  114: That didn’t make a damn bit of difference. I’m still not gettin' a damn thing.
    Who are you?
  115: Please repeat. Over.
  116: I could tell you but then I’d have to kill you.
  117: I’m the Chosen One.
  118: Well, that’s not unusual, is it? Nothing works right anymore.
  119: That’s for me to know and you to find out. Goodbye.

  121: I could tell you but then I’d have to kill you.
  122: I’m the Chosen One.
  123: Well, that’s not unusual, is it? Nothing works right anymore.
  124: That’s for me to know and you to find out. Goodbye.
  125: The President! I, uh...
  126: Oh? A wise guy, huh? Look, I’m tracing you right now, pal. We’ll see how smart
    you feel with internal security all over your fricking ass. Dickhead!
  127: Now, I’ve had enough of your bullshit. How would you like to play dodge-the-plasma
    with the Assault Squad? Huh?
  128: Hey, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you.
  129: I’ve got your trace for you, and I can show you just where to shove it.
  130: You’re putting a trace on me? Well, I’m putting a trace on you too, pal.
  131: I’d love to stick around and talk to all of your pals about that bridal shower
    you’ve been planning but I've got better things to do with my time. Goodbye.
  132: Well, I, uh, I’ve got to be going. Goodbye.
  133: Try the gain.
  134: There… that should do it. Any better?
  135: Gain? What am I’m supposed to gain? I keep pretty active, I don’t think I can
    gain anything.
  136: I’ll just try back later. Goodbye.
  137: Chosen One, huh? Well, uh, pardon me for not blowing sunshine up your ass,
    but I’m a little too busy for this bullshit.
  138: Kneel before me and I may spare your life. Gee, I like the sound of that.
  139: I no longer insist upon genuflecting. A slight bow to kiss my ring should be
    sufficient.
  140: Uh, I meant I was the one *chosen* to fix the comm-unit. Seems like nothing
    works anymore.
  141: Well, I think I’ve had just about enough of your insolence. Goodbye, peasant.
  142: Unit Three? I thought you were still at Navarro base?
  143: Navarro base? Oh yeah, Navarro base. That’s where we are. Sure. I knew that.
  144: No, we had to get out of there.
  145: Your signal’s breaking up. Goodbye.
  146: Huh, ain’t it the truth. Just don’t let anyone who’s got the President’s ear
    hear that. You’ll be making cattle-runs to New Reno ‘til the end of time, pal.
  147: The President?
  148: Only got two legs. I’d be pretty tired by the time I got there.
  149: Well, no rest for the wicked. I better get back to fixing this. Goodbye.
  150: Yeah, that’s a new one. Since my video’s working you can see I’m rolling on
    the floor here. It does seem like everything’s a damn secret though, huh?. All
    the special ops on the mainland. I don’t see how anything gets done.
  151: On the mainland? Why, where are you?
  152: Well, it’s like that all over.
  153: Yeah, you know how unhappy he gets when people complain. He takes it personal,
    like it’s a loyalty thing. Maybe that just goes with being the President of the
    United States. Or what’s left of ‘em.
  154: The President of the United States?
  155: I didn’t vote for him. I thought he was too interested in getting laid. I prefer
    a candidate that’s too old to get it up anymore—keeps their mind on the job more.
  156: Maybe so. You know, I better get back to work. Goodbye.
  157: Oh, very funny. But you’d have a great place to recover from your run — at
    least from what I hear.
  158: So you’re not in New Reno then?
  159: Well, I better get back to work. Gotta get this link fixed. Goodbye.
  160: The President of the United-fucking-States-of-America. Who’d you think I was
    talking about? Who the fu - Who is - What - I should kick your fucking ass, who
    is this?
  161: I’m the Chosen One. Kiss my...feet.
  162: I’m the Chosen One.
  163: I’m the President. You’re in a heap of trouble.
  164: You’re not important enough for that information.
  165: Uh, I better be going. Lots of work to do here. Goodbye.
  166: This is ENCLAVE main comm. ...But you should know that. Who are you?
  167: 'Oh, I’m just…hey, you ever notice that cooked gecko tastes kind of like brahmin
    butt. '
  168: I’m the Chosen One and you’ll learn to remember that.
  169: Nobody important. Goodbye.
  170: Ah, a few more moments and I’ll have your sorry ass in a sling. Hey, wait a
    minute. This can’t be right... I’ve got you somewhere on the mainland.
  171: That’s right, sucker. Right where you can’t get me.
  172: That can’t be right. I’m at the comm desk right across the hall from you....Made
    you look. What a rube.
  173: Yeah, I’m at the Poseidon Oil power plant number 12. Come and get me.
  174: I’ve got you, at Poseidon Oil, reactor number 5. Ah, well, why don’t you just
    sit tight and I’ll order up a little celebration for ya. Including fireworks.
  175: Oh, goodie. I just lo-ove fireworks. Send me a lot.
  176: I’m the Chosen One. You just better make sure you say that with a smile.
  177: I’m not anyone important. I’m going to go now. Goodbye.
  178: Yeah well, whoever you are, I just dispatched a verti-assault team to your
    location. Have a nice day.
  179: Gee, if the video worked you could see me tremble.
  180: And what are they going to do?
  181: Well, I better get going then. I’d hate for them to show up before I get the
    red carpet all unrolled. Goodbye.
  182: Usually they just go in shooting. They let someone else sift through the ashes
    to figure out what was going on.
  183: Yeah, well, they aren’t going to catch me.
  184: Oh, now you’ve got me all scared. I need to change my undies.
  185: Well, I’d hate to think I spent all day yesterday polishing my guns for nothing.
  186: Yeah, sure. I’ve killed better. Goodbye.
  187: Goodbye. Next news on you will be when I read the after-action report.
  188: What? You can read!
  189: Yeah, sure whatever.
  190: Hey, you just went on my list.
  191: You had to get out? Why? You’re on the coast. You got great defenses. I didn’t
    hear anything about that....Hey, who the hell is this anyway?
  192: I am the great and powerful Willie. Kneel before me and entreat my forgiveness
    and I may yet spare thee.
  193: Nobody important. Where’s this Navarro again?
  194: Yeah, well, we took Navarro and I found those nude pictures of your mother.
    Or was that just your dad cross-dressing again? No wonder you’re so fucking ugly.
    Goodbye, asshole.
  195: Yeah, you can say that again. And everything’s always tighter out here at ENCLAVE
    and the fuckin' President's watching us like a hawk.
  196: The President?
  197: Out here? Where are you exactly?
  198: Well, that’s how things go. Well, I better get back to work. Goodbye.

    use the help.

  138: |-
    Well, that ain't so much of a problem, 'round here that is. But, last I heard Woody was goin' to take a stroll over

  139: Yes, I know where the Den is. Go on.
  140: Actually, I don't know where the Den is.

    Well, anyhows, like I been sayin' that ain't so much of a problem 'round Gecko. But, ya see, people in other parts
     ain't so usta the way we look.
  144: So?
  145: |-
    Cain't ya put two an' two ta-gether? I'm worried that Woody might have takin' himself a nap in the Den - it's a long
     trip after all - and then they woulda buried the poor cuss alive! I need someone to go look fer 'im there.
  146: And...?
  147: Well, I miss 'im. That's why. (Percy blinks, moistly, at you) Oh, I see, you
    wanna know what's in it for you?
  148: This is usually the part where I get more interested. Tell on.
  149: |-
    Well, I know where I kin get ahold of a heck of a lot of pre-war stock of, jan-u-wine, Rad-X and RadAway. Don't do me
     no good no how, but I figure that outgha be worth sumpin to a smoothy like you. You gonna take the job fer me or not? I'll
     only pay ya off if'n I know Woody's safe.

  129: Reactor, sweet reactor.

  131: Atomic powered heating... gotta love it.
  140: Thanks for fixing the reactor. It’s a little cooler now, but not too bad.
  141: Brrr... thanks for fixing our reactor.

  119: There's a power generating station downtown that controls the power to the
    city. If you could just go there and get permission to give me a little more energy
    for my air conditioning, I'd be grateful.
  120: How grateful? Cash or equipment?
  121: Yeah, I'll do it for you.
  122: I haven't got time. Maybe later.
  123: Are you nuts? No way. Maybe you'll get so miserable you die. Do the world a
    favor.
  124: They come here because for some odd reason I exude fly nutrients. My body is
    rich with food for them, and this sweating just makes it worse.
  125: That's just plain nasty. Why not take a bath or something?
  126: Then I'll be doing you a favor by killing you.
  127: I see. That's more than I needed to know. Goodbye.
  128: I've tried that. I've tried everything. The only thing that keeps the flies
    off me is not to sweat... and when I don't have enough power to keep cool, I can't.
  129: I see. I have more questions.
  130: I see. Goodbye.
  131: Yes?
  132: I talked to Brian and he said the power rations are so tight that he can't
    possibly allow you to increase your share.
  133: Where do the flies come from?
  134: Have you tried bathing?
  135: Where's the power generator?
  136: Who are you?
  137: It's much nicer in here. Comfy?
  138: Nothing. Forget it.
  139: I could scrape a little something together for you if you did it. I can't promise
    much, but then, it's not too huge a favor, either.
  140: You've got a deal. Just make sure to have something for me when I get your
    power for you.
  141: I'll do it for free. No charge.
  142: Forget it. I don't want to do it.
  143: Let me think about it.
  144: I can't tell you how grateful I am to you. Please let me know as soon as you're
    done so I can turn up the air conditioning and take a bath.
  145: Will do. I had some other questions.
  146: Will do. So long.
  147: Please don't wait too long for this... I'm getting really sick of all these
    flies.
  148: Sure. I had some other questions.
  149: Sure. I'll let you know.
  150: Thanks ever so much for your compassion. That's sarcasm, by the way, in case
    you hadn't noticed. Get the hell out of my house.
  151: Why not go to hell and die?
  152: So long, fly boy!
  153: The power generator's on your left as you come into Broken Hills from the outside
    world. It's run by a guy named Brian, a lazy son of a bitch who does as little
    work as possible.
  154: Sounds like a real piece of work. Thanks. I have more questions.
  155: I see. Well, that's all for now.
  156: I'm Eric. I used to run the hotel in town, but I had to sell it because of
    my fly problem. I also ran the tavern, but had to get out of that, too, for the
    same reason. Finally, I used to run the generator, but flies kept getting into
    it.
  157: That's an awful lot of jobs. I have more questions.
  158: I see. So long!
  159: He said that, did he? Well, you tell him that the generator is uranium powered
    and that the miniscule amount of energy I require would barely register on the
    generator. And tell him I want my power!
  160: Will do! Nice speech!
  161: I'll tell him. I have other questions.
  162: Sure. Bye.
  163: You're done with the generator? Thank you so, so much. I can't even begin to
    describe how grateful I am.
  164: The common way to express thanks is through gifts of money or equipment.
  165: Don't, then. I'm fine with your thanks.
  166: Francis the mutant has a power fist. He keeps betting it in arm-wrestling contests.
    The problem is being stronger than him. If you're interested, I can give you some
    pills that should give you the edge over him.
  167: Sure thing.
  168: I'd rather have cash, if you have it.
  169: I don't want a reward.
  170: These pills are called buffouts. They'll increase your strength, but your mind
    will suffer for a little bit. Don't take too many or you might get hooked. Good
    luck with the fist!
  171: Thanks! So long!
  172: Do you think you can help me with my fly problem? I'd be very grateful.
  173: How grateful?
  174: Sure thing.
  175: Let me think about it.
  176: No way in hell.
  177: Here's all the money I have... $150. Thank you.
  178: No, thank you. So long.
  179: Then I'm doubly grateful. Oh... I hear you're looking for a GECK. Try asking
    around in NCR. It's to the south.
  180: Thanks! Bye!
  181: Oh yes. The flies have lessened, the air is cool, and I'm less sweaty. Better
    deal for everyone all around!
  182: I'll say. Well, that's all. So long!
  183: You see a greasy, sweating man. He looks quite comfortable.
hcseymor:
  100: You see a spore plant.
  101: You see Seymour the spore plant.
  102: You see a spore plant that somehow radiates an aura of intelligence.
  103: Hi! Nice weather we've been having, huh?
  104: Yoo talk?
  105: Rrr?
  106: Excuse me, but is this the plant that's talking?
  107: Are you connected with that scientist in any way?
  108: Bye.
  109: Yes, I do talk. Better than some people, it seems. I'd smile at you right now,
    but I just don't have a mouth. [it laughs] Say, could you do me a big favor?
  110: "'Es."
  111: Nuh.
  112: I'm looking for a better place to be. Right here is nice and all, but frankly,
    these plants aren't much for conversation.  I was thinking over there, by the
    building with all the ghouls in it... Would you replant me?
  113: "'Es!"
  114: Nuh!
  115: Sure.
  116: I think not.
  117: Great! All you have to do is find a shovel, dig me up, and plant me over there.
    When you do, I'll tell you a secret.
  118: Okay!
  119: Nuh uh.
  120: All right. Well, um... I'll be waiting here for you. Not like I really have
    a choice, you know. So long!
  121: Byeeee!
  122: If you should happen to change your mind, you know where to find me. I've put
    down roots here. Ha ha ha! Just a little plant humor for you. Oh, don't let me
    keep you. So long!
  123: Bye.
  124: Well said, well said! How delightful to see a homo sapiens use its brain to
    its fullest extent. My dear friend, would you be willing to do me a favor?
  125: "'Es."
  126: Nuh!
  127: Why, yes! Yes, it is! Very astute, friend, very astute. I can see you didn't
    germinate yesterday! My fine-stemmed companion, would you be so kind as to do
    me a favor?
  128: Sure.
  129: I don't think so.
  130: Deee-lightful! I'm very, very pleased. Just find yourself a shovel and come
    on back. When you're done, maybe I can tell you a secret. My friend, I do hope
    you continue to flower.
  131: Um, right. So long.
  132: I changed my mind.
  133: |-
    Oh, yes, the Professor. He grew me from a tiny spore and nurtured me... but I realized from an early age that if I were to act as smart as I truly
     am, he'd cut me into pieces to examine me.  So, I played dumb and got planted out here. It's nice... but I'd like to branch out a little.
     Y'know, maybe get planted someplace else...
  134: '"Branch out." Indeed.'
  135: Right. What do you want?
  136: Uh... huh. I gotta go. Bye.
  137: |-
    So does he still have the scorpion? That thing is a mean chess player... it has a lot of bark and plenty of bite,
     if you know what I mean... but I know how to beat him. If you do me a favor, I'll tell you how.
  138: Really? How?
  139: That's fascinating. A chess-playing plant. How prosaic. Goodbye.
  140: My fine friend, if you will replant me near the ghouls' home over there, I
    will be happy to impart my deep-rooted knowledge of chess.
  141: It's a deal.
  142: No thanks. I'll handle the scorpion on my own.
  143: Ahh, my friend, you have returned. This is quite a delightful place here. The
    shade is perfect, and the company is simply dazzling. That Typhon, what a kidder!
    He really makes my intellectual sap flow!
  144: Chess?
  145: What was that you mentioned about chess?
  146: Bye.
  147: |-
    Well, it was about how to beat the professor's scorpion at chess. My friend, it is simplicity itself.
     The Flying Liver Attack is like a flytrap to that bug - it walks right into it and then can't extricate itself. I guarantee your success.
  148: "'Anks! Bye!"
  149: I appreciate the information! Bye!
  150: My friend! Has the sun been shining upon you? How does your day flower? Are
    you ready for the move? I certainly am!
  151: "'Es!"
  152: Nuh uh! No move!
  153: Let's go.
  154: I've changed my mind. I don't want to help you.
  155: I'm so excited I could release a spore cloud all over myself! Let's go!
  156: "-done-"
  157: |-
    That's a pity, that's a pity indeed. I do hope you'll change your mind at some point. Perhaps the pollen of your
     indecision will blow my way again. Good day.
  158: Uh.
  159: Good day indeed.
  160: |-
    Oooh... the soil here feels so... different. Cleaner, somehow. Probably because I don't have to share it with
     those other plants.  Ahhh. Oh! Yes! If you ever run across the Professor and his scorpion, remember this chess
     maneuver: It's called the Flying Liver Attack, and the scorpion cannot stand against it.
  161: "'Anks!"
  162: Thanks. I'll try that out. Bye!
  163: |-
    I would also like to tell you that I happen to know the ghoul Typhon inside this building knows the whereabouts
     of a treasure trove. Perhaps that might be useful to you someday.
  164: "'Anks! Byee!"
  165: Have you had time to reconsider? Would you like to help me?
  166: "'Es!"
  167: Nuh!
  168: Sure.
  169: I think not.
  170: Alas, you do not appear to have a shovel. Until you can find one, I can't go.
    I await your return with bated pistil.
  171: Bye.
  172: Psst! Hey! Hey, pal! Over here!
  173: C'mere! I promise I won't hurt you.
  174: Come on. You scared of a plant?
  175: Over here! Let's get to it!
  176: Yes, I'm a talking plant. Get over it and talk to me.
  177: Whoa, friend. Don't just start digging. We've got to strategize the move first.
    Let's talk it over.
  178: You replanted Seymour by the old-ghouls home.
  179: Haf shuvl! Plant now!
  180: It just so happens I have a shovel right here. Let's go.
hcsulvan:
  100: You see a tall, graying, man with a tankard of beer.
  101: You see John L. Sullivan. The pugilist.
  102: You see a tall, older, man with muscular arms and a gray, but neatly groomed,
    handlebar mustache.
  103: Sure now, you've had a wee bit too much already.
  104: Begorah, but aren't you a stupid one.
  105: You'd give Torr a good run for his money.
  106: On your way now, ya wee strange one.
  107: Ach, another tribal tiched in the hayed.
  108: "(Looks you up and down appraisingly) Well now, what have we here? Looks as
    though you dinnay know much about the sweet science at all do ye?"
  109: If you would get off your wee high horse, I could see helpin' ye a bit with
    your skills.
  110: What are you talking about?
  111: Uh, yeah, whatever, mister. See you around. Maybe.
  112: Well, it's just my educated opinion but I can see by the way you move that
    you could do with a few pointers.
  113: Pointers? With what?
  114: I don't think so, old man. I doubt that *you* could teach me anything. Goodbye.
  115: About the sweet science, of course. The sportin' art.
  116: Uh, the art? Are you talking about magic!?! Can you teach me magic spells?
  117: What are you talking about?
  118: "(he grins broadly) Sure and begorah, I could teach you about the wee folk,
    leprechauns, spriggans, Ban'sidhe and the like. Would you like that?"
  119: That sounds great. Teach away.
  120: Pugilism, the manly art of hand-to-hand combat. That's what I mean.
  121: Pugilism, the manly, uh, and womanly art of hand-to-hand combat. That's what
    I mean.
  122: Well, I guess I could use some help with that.
  123: I think I already know more about that than you could possibly teach me.
  124: "(talking to those around you) Did ye hear that? I got myself a live one here.
    Wants to hear bout the fairies and wee goblins and such. (Hooo, haah, haah-he
    doubles over in laughter) Here lad, have a drink on me, that's your ticket to
    the realms of the fay folk."
  125: "(talking to those around you) Did ye hear that? I got myself a live one here.
    Wants to hear bout the fairies and wee goblins and such. (Hooo, haah, haah-he
    doubles over in laughter) Here lass, have a drink on me, that's your ticket to
    the realms of the fay folk."
  126: All I need is a drink? That's great. Thanks for the tip.
  127: Somehow, I feel as though you're pulling my leg a bit.
  128: Well, the drink's just a start. You have to find a fairy mound. (winks at the
    surrounding patrons)
  129: What then?
  130: Well, you sit by the mound and wait until you can see the fairy circle in the
    dew. If you jump into the fairy ring, you'll be made to dance until dawn with
    the wee folk. If you survive, they'll steal you away to the land of fairie. (heee,
    hah, hah, hah)
  131: Wow, how'd you find this out?
  132: Somehow, I think you're pulling my leg.
  133: Oh, it's in me blood, of course. Erin go bragh! (he hefts his tankard aloft)
  134: Yeah, go brag about Erin. Okay. Thanks for the tips. Hey, let me ask you about
    something else.
  135: Somehow, I think you're pulling my leg about this whole thing.
  136: Uh, well, uh, I can see that you're a busy man. See you later. Goodbye.
  137: "(He looks you over.) Mebbe' so. Mebbe' so. Well then, suit yourself."
  138: I will. Goodbye.
  139: Well, mebbe' I am at that. Ne'er-the-less, you were a bonny good sport about
    it. Here's a beer, on me, for takin' it so well.
  140: Thanks. Now what were you saying about the sweet science?
  141: I'm not taking a beer from you. I know more than you could teach me, you old
    drunk. Goodbye.
  142: Well, let's go outside and see what I can teach you. You see, it's all about
    getting your whole wee body to snap just like a whip...
  143: Uh, huh.
  144: I don't have time for this right now. Goodbye.
  145: "(Several, sweaty, hours later) So you see what you were doin' wrong then?"
  146: Yes, I do. Thanks for taking the time to help me out, Mr. Sullivan.
  147: That was great. Let me give you $10 for some brew on me. It's the least I can
    do.
  148: Yeah, I guess so. Thanks. Goodbye.
  149: It was me very own pleasure. You take care o' yourself now. And if anyone asks...you
    just tell 'em that Fightin' John Sullivan taught you how to fight that way.
  150: Will do, John. Thanks. Goodbye.
  151: No, no, no. I could nay take money from ye. It was my very own pleasure to
    teach what I know. You take darn good care of yourself now. You've got real potential.
  152: That's great, let me ask you one thing though. Where'd you learn how to fight
    like that?
  153: Thanks, John. Goodbye.
  154: That was a long time ago. When I was a wee young lad, an' dinnay have any sense
    in me thick head. A place called Reno. You keep your nose clean and stay away
    from the likes o' that place.
  155: Where's Reno?
  156: Oh, okay. Thanks, John. Goodbye.
  157: I dinnay want to tell ye. You get on now. Just keep out o' harm's way. Goodbye
    now.
  158: OK, thanks again. Goodbye, John.
  159: Keep yourself outa trouble. I've taught you all I know.
  160: Thanks. You mentioned something about the art before?
  161: Thanks, John. I sure appreciate it. Goodbye.
  162: I mean the art of pugilism. I was just pulling your leg about the other stuff.
    I'd best be getting' back to me cup now. Good luck to ye.
  163: Oh, okay. Thanks, John. Goodbye.
  164: John Sullivan has helped you improve your Melee and Unarmed Combat skills.
icMerc:
  100: You see a well-armed mercenary.
  150: You see a rugged looking man dressed in leather armor. Numerous scars and gunshot
    wounds cover his body. His armor and weapons, on the other hand, look well-maintained,
    almost new.
  151: You see a well-armed raider. He is scanning the area and fingering his weapon.
  200: Well, look at the brass balls on this son of a bitch...

  203: We got us an intruder, boys!

  205: Well, look who stopped in ta die…
  206: Damn! Somebody found us!
  207: You got some sand comin' in here…
  208: You just walked into the *wrong* place, bitch.
  209: Well, look at the swagger on this bitch...
  250: We went out drinking, and he called it 'attitude adjustment hour,' so we kicked
    his ass.
  251: We need to check those clusters in the cave...
  252: Almost time to do another check of the perimeter…
  253: Man, that tribal *stinks.* All his kind do.
  254: Damn Vault City laser cannons…
  255: Tired of polishing my gun… both of them.
  256: How long we gotta stay out here?
  257: We should be movin' out in a few days…
  258: Can't wait ta get back ta Reno. *'Specially* the Cat's Paw.
  259: Them scorps are gettin' hungry again. Heard 'em clicking last night…*click*
    *clack* *click*
  260: Did you check them mines at the entrance like I *told* you?
  261: Captain's breathing down my neck again cause I almost let that one merchant
    get away…
  262: I wonder how I can get out of this chicken-shit outfit.
  263: Lynette's a good-looking woman. Well, in a aristocratic, domineering, slave-advocating
    kind of way.
  264: "…so then *she* says, 'that's my belly button, dipshit!' Haw! That joke *always*
    kills me."
  265: Good to go.
  266: The Captain's really busting my balls…
  267: I feel like I've been standing here forever, just waiting for somebody to show.
  268: Wish I had some other map I could go to.

  206: You got some sand comin' in here…
  207: You just walked into the *wrong* place, bitch.
  208: Well, look at the swagger on this bitch...
  215: Better call those killer teams in soon...
  216: I think Bravo team is a few klicks south of Vault City...they're still tracking
    that caravan.
  217: That desert cherry better shape up soon...that sort of shit won't wash around
    here.
  218: Almost time to send some men to check the perimeter…
  219: If we could only sabotage those Vault City laser cannons…
  220: Still waiting for word from Bishop…
  221: Been a week since Bishop sent a messenger.
  222: I figure the next caravan ought to be from NCR to Vault City…
  223: We gotta be ready to move out at a moment's notice.
  224: Hope those boys checked the traps.
  225: Have Alpha and Bravo team checked back in yet?
icScout:
  100: You see Shadow-Who-Walks.
  150: You see a heavily-muscled primitive with black scars covering his face. He
    is watching you silently.
  151: You see Shadow-Who-Walks. His face is heavily scarred by ritual tattoos.
  200: He just stares at you in silence.
  201: He watches you silently.
  300: Shhh... I'm huntin' wabbits.
iiSafe:
  100: You see a huge black iron safe.
  101: You see a black square thing with a big nose.
  200: You see a huge black metal square thing with a nose on the front.
  201: You see a huge black iron safe that looks way too heavy to move. There's a
    combination dial on the front.
  202: 'Ullo box me '
  203: " Hoo you?"
  204: Twist its nose
  205: Wander off
  206: Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on these three dog tags can open the safe...
  207: Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.
  208: Spin the dial randomly.
  209: Examine the safe for traps.
  210: Leave the safe alone.
  220: There is a KER-KLANK. The safe is now unlocked.
  221: The safe is unlocked.
  222: The nose turns in your hand! It looks like you could pull open the face if
    you wanted to.
  223: The big metal square thing looks like it can be opened.
  224: Open the face
  225: Wander off
  226: Loot the safe.
  227: Leave the safe alone.
  235: Close inspection of the safe reveals a black wire running into the dirt just
    beneath the safe. Brushing away the dirt, you discover that the fuse runs to a
    stick of dynamite with a timer on it.
  236: Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on the three dog tags can open the safe...
  237: Try and disarm the trap.
  238: Leave the safe alone.
  250: You turn the dial slowly for several minutes, but you can't make out anything.
  251: Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on these three dog tags can open the safe...
  252: Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.
  253: Spin the dial randomly.
  254: Leave the safe alone.
  275: You don't find any traps on the safe.
  276: Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on the three dog tags can open the safe...
  277: Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.
  278: Spin the dial randomly.
  279: Examine the safe for traps again.
  280: Leave the safe alone.
  290: You are turning the knob...when suddenly there is a KER-KLANK. The safe is
    now unlocked!
  291: |-
    You are spinning the dial randomly, when suddenly the dial catches on a number...there is a KER-KLANK. The safe
     is now unlocked!
  292: Hullo? Hulllooo? Anbody hoome?
  293: Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen...
  294: Yeah, I have the touch...
  305: You turn the knob, but the tiny door won't open!
  306: You spin the dial for several minutes, and nothing happens.
  307: Hulllooo? Hulllo box...
  308: Keep twisting its nose.

  313: Leave the safe alone.
  320: The thing doesn't answer.
  321: The black square cube thing doesn't seem to notice you.
  322: The metal box ignores you.
  323: 'Helloooooo? Me '
  324: " Hoo yoo?"
  325: Twist its nose
  326: Wander off
  340: With surgical precision, you disarm the fuse and pull the dynamite from beneath
    the dirt. The trap is now disarmed.
  341: Now to crack this safe...
  342: Leave the safe alone.
  343: You don't have time to try the safe during combat.
  344: You have cracked the raiders' safe.
kcgnratr:
  100: It looks like a generator.
  101: This generator probably powers the elevator.
  200: The generator needs repairs first.
  201: The generator is already running.
  202: You shutdown the generator.
  300: That skill is useless on a generator.
  400: You repair the generator and start it up.
  401: You failed to repair the generator.
kcwupass:
  100: You see a Security Bot.
  101: You see a Security Bot.
klatoxcv:
  100: You have entered the toxic caves.
mcAtkDog:
  100: You see a guard dog.
  101: You see a wild dog.
  120: You see a guard dog.
  121: You see a wild dog.
  200: ":: GROWL ::"
  201: ":: SNARL ::"
  202: ":: ROOF ::"
  205: Woof
  206: Woof woof
  210: The dogs seem to be trained to protect what's inside the shed.
  211: Doggy no like me.
  212: Good doggy!
  250: This dog looks like it could really tear you up if it needed to.
mcBalWif:
  100: Sob-
  101: Jonny…
  102: Sniff...
  103: I miss my son.
  110: Please find Jonny.
  120: Please bring Jonny back.
  121: Thank you for returning Jonny to me.
  150: You see Baltha's wife.
  151: You see Baltha's wife. She looks pretty upset.
  152: You see Baltha's wife. She appears to be in a pleasant mood now.
mcBaltha:
  100: A heavy set man wearing a leather apron.
  101: Balthas the tanner.
  102: A tall, muscular man who looks and smells of leather.
  151: My son was mistakenly killed in the fight.
  152: I can’t bear to live without Jonny.
  153: "[Sob]"
  154: Meet us down at the Ghost Farm. We’re going to attack the ghosts.
  155: Hello, my name’s Balthas. I run the tannery here in Modoc. Can I help you?
  156: You seem a bit preoccupied; is there something wrong?
  157: I’d like to see your wares.
  158: Have you seen a gold watch lying around anywhere?
  159: I’ll be back later.
  160: |-
    I’m searching for an item called a GECK. Do you by any chance know anything about it, or how I
     might obtain one?
  161: GECK?
  163: What can I help you with?
  168: Just looking, thanks.
  171: Any luck finding Jonny?
  172: |-
    I found this at the bottom of the old dry well. A part of the well had fallen in, and
     this was in the debris. I’m sorry, but I believe Jonny is dead.
  173: No, nothing yet.
  175: |-
    Thank you for returning my boy to me. There’s no way I can ever repay you, but please take this
     leather armor as thanks. I’ve been experimenting with a new curing process; I think you’ll find this
     armor very durabable, and besides -- you look really good in it.
  176: Thank you for saving my son!
  177: Please leave me to my grief.
  178: |-
    Jonny is alive! Some people called Slags have rescued him. If you can wait just a little longer,
     I’m working on a way to get Jonny back home to you.
  179: |-
    Jonny’s been kidnapped. The ghosts at the farm have got him, and plan to sacrifice him to their
     dark god.
  180: I understand; sorry to disturb you.
  181: |-
    Huh? Look, I don’t discuss my personal life with strangers. Do you have any business with me or
     not?
  182: 'Pardon me, my name is '
  183: ". Now that we’re properly introduced, you seem troubled."
  184: Yes, I’m interested in some leather goods.
  186: I guess I don’t.
  187: 'Did you say '
  188: |-
    ? Yes, I think I’ve heard of you. One of the guards on a passing caravan mentioned some good
     things about a person with that name. I know we’ve just met, but I could really use your
     help.
  189: Why don’t you tell me what your problem is, and maybe I’ll be able to help.
  190: I have problems of my own, sorry.
  191: |-
    [He picks up a metal chisel and starts to wring it anxiously. To your amazement, the chisel begins
     to bend like putty. This guy’s strong!] My boy, Jonny, is missing! He went out to play a few days ago and
     never came back. We’ve searched everywhere, but still haven’t found him.
  192: Where does Jonny normally play? Does he usually play with someone else?
  193: I’m sorry about your kid, but what could I possibly do?
  194: |-
    That’s horrible! But I just stopped in to look at some leather goods. I don’t suppose I could
     see some of your merchandise?
  195: Oooh! Look at the time. I have to be going.
  196: |-
    Does that mean you’ll help me? Thank you! Jonny was last seen playing cowboys and Indians with
     his dog Laddie out front. The two of them are inseparable; in fact, that’s how we knew something was
     wrong. One day, Laddie came back without Jonny. We’ve been searching ever since. Take Laddie with
     you; maybe the two of you will be able to find Jonny.
  197: |-
    Well, you have the air of an experienced traveler. With your skills, maybe you’ll be able to
     track down my son.
  198: Well, yes! I am quite a skillful tracker, if I do say so myself. Okay, I’ll
    help.
  199: Flattery will get you nowhere. Look, I need to ask you some questions.
  200: |-
    My prayers are answered! Take Laddie with you; maybe he can help. Please
     hurry!
  201: Well, maybe you’re right. Thanks for listening.
  202: |-
    I’ve heard of you. Look, I don’t want any trouble; we’re a peaceful community. Let’s just keep
     the subject to business, OK?
  203: I have some questions for you.
  204: I don’t have any business with you for now. Bye.
  205: |-
    Well… I’m worried about my missing son, Jonny. We’ve searched everywhere, but still can’t find
     him. I fear that maybe wild animals got him.
  206: Maybe I can help. I do a lot of traveling; I’ll keep a lookout for your boy.
  208: |-
    I would really appreciate that. Every little bit helps. In the mean time, did you have some
     business with me?
  210: No, not really. I’ll be going now, thanks.
  211: Sorry, I never heard of it.
  214: |-
    Hehehe. Has Old Cornelius got you looking for his pocket watch, too? No, you won’t find it here.
     That old coot probably just left somewhere and forgot about it.
  215: Thanks anyway. I’ll keep looking. Bye
  216: |-
    [He looks at you closely and then smiles.] Why don’t you be a good little boy and run outside
     and play?
  217: |-
    [He looks at you closely and then smiles.] Why don’t you be a good little girl and run outside
     and play?
  218: Please keep looking. I know he’s still alive, I can feel it!
  219: |-
    That’s Jonny’s BB gun all right. Noooooooooooooooooooo! [Balthas breaks down and starts to cry
     uncontrollably.]
  220: |-
    I knew Jonny wasn’t dead! You say I have to wait… I don’t understand! Is he hurt? My instincts
     tell me to go to my son, but I sense you have my son's best interest at heart. Please hurry, and bring
     my son back to me.
  221: |-
    Oh no! Not the ghosts! I knew we should’ve burned that place to the ground. I won’t let them
     take my boy... I’m going to get little Jonny back, whatever the cost. I’m sure the residents of Modoc
     will help me get my son back! Meet us at the Ghost Farm. We’ll kill them all!
  230: You have safely returned Jonny back to Modoc.
mcBess:
  100: According to the tag on its collar, its name is Bess.
  101: You see Bess.
  110: It looks like its been attacked by some wild animal. It's hurt pretty bad.
  111: That's a fine brahmin anyone would be proud to own.
  120: Moooooo!
  121: "[This poor brahmin is injured.]"
  130: Mooooooooo.
  131: "[Bess lets out a low, mournful moo.]"
  132: Poor girl - maybe I shouldn't have sold you for jerky. Would you like to get
    out of here?
  133: Yup! You're going to make some mighty tasty jerky. See ya.
  140: Mooooooo.
  141: "[That sounded like a much happier moo.]"
  142: OK, then let's get out of here.
  143: Just kidding. I need the jerky more than I need you.
  150: Mooo.
  200: First aid skills won't help heal this poor brahmin's broken leg.
  300: You successfuly heal the brahmin's broken leg.
  310: You fail to heal the brahmin's broken leg.
mcButchr:
  100: More scraps for Rose.
  101: Uh! I never get used to this.
  102: I love my work.
  103: Balthas will pay a pretty coin for this hide.
  104: I hear you can make a great dessert from the eyeball squeezin's.
  105: I'm about ready for a smoke.
  120: That's a good Bessy.
  200: Move it, mister; I've got brahmin to kill.
  201: Get out of the way.
  202: Can you please move? I've got work to do.
  203: Hey lady, do you mind moving? I've got brahmin to kill.
  250: You see a butcher.
  251: This is the "slaughterhouse technician."
  252: This is the slaughterhouse butcher. His clothes are drenched in dead brahmin.
  253: You can smell this poor sap from here.
  275: Damn, it looks like we're gonna need some more brahmin here.
  276: Well, might as well call it a day. We're outta brahmin. Wahoo!!! BEER TIME!!!
  277: Shucks! No more brahmin to kill! Maybe I should go see Miria.
  280: Ahhh, time to go home and relax in my own stink.
  281: It's time to head home and have a nice jerky steak.
  282: |-
    That was a long day. I hope to god someone kills me in my sleep so I don't have to do this
     again.
  300: Jerky is good for the bones.
  301: Jerky is good for the hair.
  302: Jerky is good for the lungs.
  303: Jerky is good for the stomach.
  304: Jerky is good for the loins.
  305: Jerky tastes good.
  306: Christ, did a brahmin shit in here?
  307: I think I stained my coat. HA! HA! HA!
  308: Watch your step. This place is full of nasty things on the ground.
  309: You like jerky?
  310: I even like jerky for breakfast.
  311: Milk, ice-cream, all makes my stomach nuts. But JERKY!!!
  312: Hey! Listen here, JERKY!!! HA! HA! HA!
mcChild:
  100: A small boy.
  101: A little girl.
  120: A small boy. He seems rather playful.
  121: A little girl. She seems rather playful.
  150: Don't eat me!
  151: Eeeee! The boogy-monster!
  152: Daddy says you're a bad person.
  153: Aieeee! Run away!
  154: You're scaring me.
  155: Stop looking at me.
  156: I'm not supposed to talk to tribals.
  157: Wiener dog.
  158: My mom said you'll eat me if I'm bad.
  159: I'm not afraid of you!
  160: Help meee!
  161: It's after me!
  162: Please don't hurt me!
  163: Stay away from me!
  164: Eeeeeeeee!
  165: I hate you!
  166: Mommy mommy mommy!
  167: Leave me alone!
  168: You stink!
  170: Hello there.
  171: Want to play house?
  172: Do you really poke a bone through your nose?
  173: How come you're so funny looking?
  174: My mom says you're primitive.
  175: Has your tribe stopped eating people?
  176: Who dressed you so funny?
  177: I'll bet you're nicer than you look.
  178: Let's play tag. You're it.
  179: You don't smell that bad.
  180: Have you seen my invisible friend?
  181: I want to travel the world when I'm as old as you.
  182: You’re a nice tribal, not like the others.
  183: I bet you do bathe.
  184: You’re smarter than Torr.
  185: Is that blade you have really sharp?
  186: I want to be just like you when I grow up.
  187: My dog loves drymeat.
  188: I’ve got a shiny pebble.
  189: Have you seen my invisible friend?
  190: Can I join your tribe?
  191: You're nice.
  192: You look funny.
  193: Whatcha wearing?
  194: I want a brahmin ride!
  195: Are you from far away?
  196: Weeee! Ha, ha, ha!
  197: Don't leave!
  198: Do you have some food?
  199: Am I bothering you?
  200: Where ya going?
  201: Can I come with you?
  202: How old are you?
  203: What's your name?
  204: Do you like kids?
  205: What is that?
  206: Do you wanna play a game?
  207: Whatcha doing?
  208: Have you seen any bugs?
  209: Where did you get that?
  210: Can I have that?
  211: What do you do?
  212: I can run fast. Wanna see?
  213: Watch me! Watch me!
  214: Mommy says I talk to much.
  215: Where is your home?
  216: Heeee! Heeee!
  217: Are you gonna stay here?
  218: Do you have kids?
  219: Why did you come here?
  220: I like you.
  221: Do you like me?
  222: Are you married?
  223: One, two, three... Weee!
  300: Stranger!
mcCornel:
  100: An old man.
  101: Cornelius.
  102: |-
    Other than the slightly unsettled look on his face, there appears to be nothing out of the
     ordinary about him.
  150: |-
    Welcome to Rose’s Bed and Breakfast. My name is Rose -- I mean, Cornelius -- and I run this bed
     and breakfast. Can I help you?
  151: If you run this place, then how come it’s called ROSE’S Bed and Breakfast?
  152: I’m looking for a gold watch.
  153: What do you do here?
  154: Who’s Rose?
  155: I’m interested in getting a room.
  156: Questions? Was I asking you something? Hi, my name’s Cornelius.
  162: You need some serious help, old man.
  163: Farrel’s got your watch in a wall safe. Let’s string him up.
  164: I found your watch at Farrel’s house. You were right; Farrel is the thief.
  165: It seems an industrious rat made off with your watch. I recovered this from
    its nest.
  166: Hello thar! Have we met?
  176: |-
    My God! Somebody killed my best friend, Farrel! The whole town is looking for the murderer.
     We’re going to lynch him when we catch him!
  177: I killed him. What are going to do about it, you crazy old man?
  178: Whoa! Look at the time. I have to be going.
  179: Rose is my wife; I named this place after her. Did you know I’m married?
  180: Can I ask you some more questions?
  181: |-
    THEN WHY DON’T YOU ASK THAT NO-GOOD FARREL!? MAYBE HE’LL SELL YOU THE WATCH HE STOLE FROM ME!
     Now if you don’t mind, I’m quite busy. I got to shave the brahmin.
  182: |-
    I run this motel. Yep, this place would fall apart if it weren’t for me. Have you been to the
     outhouse? Cleanest outhouse you’ve ever been to. That’s my doing.
  183: What does having a clean outhouse have to do with running this place?
  184: |-
    Rose is my wife. She runs the kitchen. You won’t find a better meal anywheres else. Rose, she’s
     so beautiful. I’m going to marry her some day.
  185: I thought you just said Rose is your wife.
  186: I have a room. I sleep over there. Where do you sleep?
  187: I don’t think you understand. I would like to rent a room for the night.
  188: |-
    A while back, I forget when... my best friend of 30… or was it 40 years? Oh, it doesn’t matter,
     what matters is that he stole my precious gold pocket watch. It has been handed down in my family for
     five, no six, err... four generations. Yep, I distinctly remember setting it down on my desk. Then,
     when I looked on the kitchen table, it was gone.
  189: OK, I’ll bring your watch back.
  190: Did you try looking for it on your desk?
  191: |-
    You’ll help me? That’s great! Go beat up Farrel and get my watch back. He probably hid it good.
     So tear his house apart and look for it.
  192: What are you talking about?
  193: Look, I don’t want any part of this.
  194: Kill Farrel, get watch back… got it? I’ll be right back.
  195: |-
    Kill Farrel? Who’s going to kill Farrel? He’s my best friend! I’ll personally string up the
     villain who tries to kill Farrel.
  196: I accept the job, and I expect payment upon completion.
  197: I can’t take this anymore. I’m leaving.
  198: Of course, I’ll pay you. As soon as you finish cleaning out the barn come back
    and see me.
  199: I have a watch. It was a gold watch. I wonder where I put it?
  200: Yes, yes, yes. I’ve looked in my sock drawer. It’s not there, either.
  201: I’ll keep a lookout for your watch while I’m in town.
  202: There’s no way I’m helping a crazy old man like you. I'm outta here.
  203: |-
    I knew I couldn’t trust him! I’m gonna string him up by the ears until he gives me back my
     watch.
  204: There’s nothing in there. Sheriff Jo and myself looked there already.
  206: |-
    He did? I knew it! I’ll teach him a lesson he’ll never forget. You’d better stay here or you
     might get hurt.
  207: |-
    That’s my watch! What are you doing with that? Give it back! [He snatches the watch from your
     hands.] I think you better go; we don’t take kindly to thieves around here.
  208: That’s gratitude for you.
  209: Have you tried Rose’s omelets? They’re delicious.
  210: I saw Jonny playing by the well with his dog Laddie. What a nice kid.
  211: Don’t go to the Ghost Farm unless you’re tired of living.
  212: Miria is a nice girl. We used to play doctor when she was little.
  213: Davin is a nice kid. I wonder why he doesn’t look anything like his father?
  214: |-
    I was sitting on the toilet one day and a big dog climbed out of the sewer. Scared me half to
     death.
  215: Grisham is a nice fellow. He sells us scraps to feed the giant chicken.
  216: Stay away from the chicken coop! I almost lost an arm feeding that thing.
  217: Rose’s dogs are vicious, but I just throw them some jerky and they don’t pay
    me no mind.
  218: Farrel’s my best friend in the whole world.
  219: Laddie is a smart dog. I talk to him all the time.
  220: |-
    I hear Grisham is trying to marry off his kids. I wonder if Rose wouldn’t mind if I got another
     wife.
  222: Pog? Whatever happened to that game, anyway? Well, I have to go. Maybe we can
    play later.
  223: I FOUND THE MURDERER! HE ADMITTED TO KILLING FARREL! LET’S GET HIM!
  224: I FOUND THE MURDERER! SHE ADMITTED TO KILLING FARREL! LET’S GET HER!
  225: Me kill Farrel.
  300: "[Hmmm... Certain words seem to set him off.] Rose... Room... Running..."
  301: Ooga.
  501: I always knew you were a thief!
  502: How could you do this to your best friend!
  503: I'm gonna kill you!
  504: I'm gonna mount your head on my wall!
  550: He appears to be pre-occupied at the moment.
  600: You have returned the watch to Cornelius.
  650: You have resolved the dispute between Cornelius and Farrel.
mcDavin:
  100: A handsome young man.
  101: You see Davin.
  102: A young man in his twenties. He looks a lot like Grisham.
  150: If you asked, you could have me.
  151: Hmpf! Miria isn’t that good in bed.
  152: I don’t believe you pimped me.
  153: Let’s try a threesome next time.
  154: Ooo… he’s a cutie.
  155: Ask her.
  156: That was great; who’s next?
  157: Hi! My name’s Davin; I help my father run the slaughterhouse in Modoc.
  158: I’m looking for Cornelius’s gold watch. Have you seen it anywhere?
  159: What do you do at the slaughterhouse?
  160: I hear rumors about you and the brahmin.
  161: Tell me about your dad.
  162: Hello again.
  163: I knew you’d come back to me.
  168: Why don’t we get more comfortable?
  171: Stay here.
  172: Sure, I’m not busy. Ask away.
  178: Nope, haven’t seen it anywhere.
  179: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  180: |-
    Well, I uh… I mean, I… I supervise and take care of stuff. I’m the owner’s son after all. I’m
     going to inherit this place when my dad kicks off.
  182: |-
    It’s a lie. I only go out to the barn at night to a… make sure everything is locked up. You
     know, with all the wild animals around and all.
  184: |-
    Dad runs the slaughterhouse. He’s OK as far as fathers go. A word of advice if you do any
     business with him. There’s usually more to his business deals than he lets on.
  186: Come back and see me if you want to… talk again.
  187: |-
    Wow, I never thought such a beautiful woman would try to seduce me. What! You’re not a woman!
     Don’t worry, you’re so pretty, I won’t say anything if you won’t.
  188: |-
    I have to be dreaming. I don’t believe such a beautiful woman is trying to seduce me. You are
     trying to seduce me, right?
  189: |-
    To look into your eyes is sheer heaven. Let us not break the spell of this precious moment with
     words. Let our actions speak for themselves.
  190: Stop talking; you’re gonna ruin it for the both of us. Just sit back and enjoy.
  191: There must be some mistake; I just wanted to ask you some questions.
  192: Thanks for the offer, but no. Uhhh... I'll be leaving now.
  193: |-
    Oh god! Take me! Take me now! [He rips off his clothes, then your clothes… then… Use your
     imagination]
  194: '[Giggles] I''m "caboose"! You can be it the next time.'
  195: "[Two hours later: The earth moved, and this bed will never be the same.]"
  196: "[One hour later, and the best orgasm you’ve ever had.]"
  197: "[Half an hour later, you lie there exhausted.]"
  198: "[Fifteen minutes and a couple grunts later.]"
  199: "[You made it as far as removing your shirt before you no longer felt the need.]"
  200: I have to go. Bye.
  400: Dad!
  401: Uh-oh!
  402: I surely do!
  410: Uhh...
  411: Uhhh... Continue, please...
  412: I sure the hell…
  413: Um… I do.
  450: Uhhh, I'm not the one you should be talking too.
  500: Oh boy, I get to be the one that's in charge here.
  1000: Yes, my sweet.
  1001: What can I do for you, lover boy?
  1100: I'm completely healed and ready to go.
  1200: Hardly more than a scratch left on me now.
  1300: Well, I'm mostly healed but I could use more healing when we get a chance.
  1400: I healed myself as much as I could but I'm still pretty badly hurt.
  1500: No, baby; I wanna come with you.
  1600: Sure thing, I'll put it away.
  1700: OK, I'm right behind you all the way.
  1800: Then I wouldn't be able to protect you. No, I better stay close.
  1900: Is that it? No way. I'm not letting you out my sight, you little sex pistol.
  1005: You don't understand. I just don't want you clinging on me so much when we're
    walking around.
  1006: What you're doing wrong is I need you to walk far behind.
  1007: But... But... What did I do wrong?
  1008: What is it you want from me, my dearest?
  1009: Thanks, it was starting to chaff anyway. So now what, lover?
  1010: |-
    I used to skin the brahmin at the slaughterhouse, so I'm pretty handy with the
     knife. Also dad had me beat a brahmin to death with a crowbar once. I guess I could use
     a club if I need to. Uhhh, oh yeah, dad took me to shoot a pistol once, but I got
     scared and almost shot him by accident.
  1020: I need a little space, Davin.
mcDthClw:
  100: Rose's chicken.
  110: Sounds like something BIG is moving around inside.
mcFarrel:
  100: An old man. He makes a prune look fresh.
  101: Farrel.
  102: You hear the sound of dry twigs cracking every time he moves.
  150: Hey, get away from there!
  151: Stop that!
  152: Thief!
  153: I didn’t steal the watch, so stop coming over here and harassing poor old Farrel!
  154: Cornelius says you stole his gold watch.
  155: Where’d you get the money for the new tools?
  156: What can you tell me about Modoc?
  157: What do you do around here?
  158: Watch? What are you talking about?
  159: Now what!?
  162: What are you hiding in the wall safe?
  165: Can you take me to your garden?
  166: I cleared out all the vermin from your garden.
  167: You mentioned something about a watch earlier.
  168: Is this the watch you were looking for?
  169: All furries dead!
  170: Gar – din?
  171: |-
    Not again! How many people is Cornelius going to send over to look for his watch? I didn’t do
     it! In fact, I was probably the victim of the same thief. Around the same time his watch disappeared,
     some of my tools were stolen. I’m sure you don’t believe me, so you might as well have a look
     around, otherwise you’ll never go away. Well, go on!
  172: I think I will have a look around.
  173: |-
    Did Miria tell you that? I’ll have to spank her bottom for spreading rumors again! Look, I may
     be poor, but I have my pride. I helped one of the traders fix his wagon, and in return he gave me some
     tools.
  174: Admit it - you’re guilty!
  175: What proof do you have that what you say is true?
  176: Do you expect me to believe that?
  177: My honor alone is proof enough that my words are true. I can offer nothing
    more.
  178: If you didn’t take it, then who do you think took it?
  179: |-
    I suspect a thief passing through town took the watch, and has since moved on. Although I can’t
     for the life of me think of a reason he would want my old tools...
  180: Do you expect me to believe that?
  181: No, but since I know I didn’t do it, that’s the only theory I could come up
    with.
  182: Can I ask you some more questions?
  183: |-
    HA! If you think I’m so guilty, why don’t you just shoot me and get it over with. You little
     punk, come and get me!
  184: |-
    How did you find it? I hid that safe so nobody would be able to find it. You must be a
     professional thief. Hmm… where were you when the gold watch disappeared? I think you’d better leave,
     and nothing better be missing from the safe or I’ll have Sheriff Jo on ya. Now get out!
  185: |-
    Modoc is a small community of farmers and ranchers. We supply most of the food for the
     surrounding towns and cities by trading our crops for various essentials. It’s actually a very nice
     arrangement. However, this could all change with the drought. We can barely keep ourselves fed, let
     alone have surplus to trade.
  187: |-
    Well, mostly I putter around in the garden, trying to make those damn plants grow without
     water. I can’t do that now because something big has moved in and I can’t seem to get rid of it.
     And to top it all off, nobody will help me because they think I stole Cornelius’s gold watch.
  188: |-
    Well, mostly I putter around in the garden, trying to make those damn plants grow without
     water. But I can’t do that now because something big has moved in and I can’t seem to get rid of it.
     Without food from my garden, I’ll surly starve.
  189: I can help you, for a price.
  190: I’ll be happy to help.
  191: Admit you stole the watch and I’ll help.
  193: |-
    Look around! I’m just a poor old man. I can barely afford to keep myself fed, let alone reward
     you.
  194: I’ll be glad to help you anyway.
  195: Sorry, I can’t help you then.
  196: |-
    That would be wonderful. I can’t thank you enough. My garden is little ways east of here. Come
     with me, I’ll show you.
  197: |-
    Thank you! You are truly a hero amongst heroes. Not many people would risk their lives for a
     total stranger. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you… [You get this warm fuzzy feeling all the way down to
     your toes.]
  198: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  199: I’d rather starve than tarnish my good name! Go to hell!
  200: |-
    Everybody is accusing me of stealing my best friend Cornelius’s gold pocket watch. Me and
     Cornelius have been friends as long as I can remember; I would never take his watch. I’ve searched
     everywhere hoping to find it so we can be friends again, but I’ve had no such luck.
  201: I’ll be around for awhile. If I come across it, I’ll let you know.
  202: That’s really too bad. Can I ask you some more questions?
  203: |-
    Would you really? Nobody will help me because they think I stole the watch. It would be nice to
     have somebody on my side, for once. I’ve already questioned everyone about it, but it won’t hurt to ask
     everybody again. Maybe they’ll tell you something they wouldn’t tell me. It also won’t hurt to poke yer
     nose around Rose’s Bed and Breakfast; Cornelius is notorious for putting stuff down and forgetting
     where he put it a minute later.
  205: |-
    Let me see that! Yes, this is it! You said a rat living down the sewage hole stole it? And you
     climbed down there and retrieved it? EWWW! I’m going to give this to Cornelius right now! Now we can be
     friends again. Thank you.
  206: |-
    Ooga right back at ya. How would you like to do old Farrel a favor, my slope-foreheaded little
     friend? I have this little vermin problem in my garden. Make the little pests go away and I’ll give
     you a reward.
  207: No, no, no… me no do.
  208: Yep. I do.
  209: Bye bye!
  210: Then get out, you dimwitted cave dweller!
  211: |-
    So good of you, my dear fellow. [He takes your hand and walks you to the garden.] Wouldn’t want
     you to get lost. Come back and see me when you finish killing the pests.
  212: |-
    My dear, sweet, woman. You’re so kind to an old man. [He takes your hand and walks you to the
     garden.] Wouldn’t want you to get lost. Come back and see me when you finish killing the pests.
  213: |-
    Fantastic! And here is your reward. [He digs in his pants and produces a half eaten cookie.] Now
     be a good little caveman and take your cookie outside and play.
  300: I'm gonna kill that bastard.
  301: I hate him...
  302: Grrr...
  501: I didn't steal yer stupid watch!
  502: I'm innocent, I tell ya!
  503: You couldn't hit the broadside of a barn!
  550: He's not paying attention to what you're saying.
  600: You have peacefully solved the feud between Farrel and Cornelius.
mcGrisha:
  100: A very active old man.
  101: Grisham.
  102: You can’t quite place him, but he looks familiar.
  151: I told you you’d get yours!
  152: Bwahahaha!
  153: Go away!
  154: I'm busy!
  155: I knew my daughter was odd.
  156: Different people, different tastes, I suppose.
  157: I think I’m going to be sick.
  158: I knew my son was odd.
  159: I guess you’re family, now.
  160: You take good care of my daughter.
  161: You take good care of my son.
  162: The name’s Grisham. Welcome to my slaughterhouse. You dropping off or picking
    up?
  163: I guess picking up? I’m interested in buying some traveling provisions.
  164: You wouldn’t have happened to have seen a gold watch lying around here somewhere?
  350: "[Looking at Bessy] Dropping off."
  165: What can I do for you now?
  166: I would like to buy some of your famous jerky.
  168: Can you tell me a little bit about the slaughterhouse?
  169: I see the drought hasn’t affected your business yet.
  360: I'd like you to make some jerky for me.
  170: 'I knew you’d be able to handle it. Let’s see now, I owe you $1000 for completing
    the job. Of course, '
  171: " brahmin got killed due to your carelessness. At $100 per brahmin your reward
    is "
  172: |-
    . Don’t even bother to lie about the number of brahmin killed -- I had one of my boys follow you
     out and watch from a distance.
  173: You never said anything about charging me if any brahmin died!
  174: |-
    Why, you conniving, dried up old coot. Arg! Mark my words - this is the last time you get the best
     of me!
  175: Thanks, pops; pleasure doing business with ya.
  176: |-
    How dare you show your face around here. I lost ten brahmin due to your cowardice. However, if
     you wish to make amends, $1500 would do a lot to cover my losses.
  177: Those brahmin weren’t worth more than a $1000.
  178: |-
    I don’t have that kind of money, and if I did, I wouldn’t give it to a little trickster like
     you.
  179: I’ve left my money in my room; let me go get it for you.
  180: |-
    Ah! Of course, of course. Let’s see, for traveling, I recommend our world famous dried brahmin
     strips. Won’t spoil on the road and it’s tasty, too. Only $10 a package. You interested?
  181: Sounds good; give me one package.
  182: No thanks, maybe later. I would like to ask you some questions, though.
  183: A pleasure doing business with you. Is there anything else I can do for you?
  185: |-
    Wait! You look to be a capable traveler. I don’t suppose you’d be interested in making some
     money?
  186: |-
    Are you sure you’re not interested in making some money? I’m quite sure you’d be able to solve
     my problem quite easily.
  187: That depends. How much, what do I have to do, and most importantly, HOW MUCH?
  188: |-
    Smart as whip! You remind me of myself when I was young. Simple... some wild dogs have been
     coming down out of the hills lately looking for food. I think they find brahmin easy prey and have been
     attacking my herds nightly. Wipe out their pack, and I’ll give you $1000.
  189: You’re holding something back, you old coot. What’s the catch?
  190: |-
    Perceptive as well as smart. I knew I wouldn’t be able to pull anything on you. The catch is
     that for every brahmin you let get killed, I charge you $100. I pay well for success and I also charge
     for failure. That’s the risk you take working for me.
  191: |-
    Great! Head out to the pastures at night and kill the pack of wild dogs that are attacking my
     brahmin. Come back here when you finish the job.
  192: |-
    Great jumping horny jacko-snatchers! Is Cornelius still looking for his lost watch? Why can’t he
     accept that it’s gone? That dang watch never worked anyways, and I’ll be a brahmin’s uncle if it was
     actually made of gold. Give it up; you’ll never find it.
  193: Actually, Farrel asked me to look for it.
  194: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  195: Thanks all the same, but I’ll keep looking.
  196: |-
    I didn’t? Are you sure? I could have sworn I told ya... maybe next time you won’t go accepting
     jobs until you know all the details. Now if you don’t mind, I have other work to attend to.
  197: Hehehe. Now that all depends. Are you planning to stay in town much longer?
    Bwahahahaha!
  198: I see you’re no fool. OK - $1000 then, and we call it even. Shake on it.
  199: "[SHAKE HANDS WITH GRISHAM]"
  200: |-
    Now hold on a minute. Now that I think of it, those brahmin looked a bit thin. How about $750,
     instead?
  201: I changed my mind, I don’t want to pay you.
  202: "[Gives you a big toothy smile] Good to see you’re a person of character."
  203: "[Grisham turns beet red and talks to you with teeth clenched.] OK, $750 then.
    Give me the money!"
  204: |-
    You know, $750 still seems kind of expensive. Those brahmin would have died anyway if the dogs
     didn’t get them first. But I’m not totally selfish; I’ll give you $50.
  206: FINE! GIVE ME THE MONEY AND GET OUT!
  207: "[LEAVE WITHOUT PAYING]"
  208: Mark my words, you’ll get yours. If not by me, then by someone else.
  209: |-
    [Grisham smiles at you in such a way that you involuntarily take a step back.] Why don’t you
     just keep your money? I have feeling you might have need of it later.
  210: |-
    Not much to tell. I run the slaughterhouse in Modoc; you want something slaughtered, you bring
     it to me. I’ll kill it for ya and make it into some of the best jerky you’ve ever tasted.
  211: What about the hides and other parts of the animal?
  213: |-
    Actually, it has kind of helped my business. Nobody has been able to grow sufficient
     food for their brahmin, so they are severely culling their herds. But that’s just a temporary thing;
     you have to look at the big picture. With the decline in the brahmin population, my business can only
     suffer.
  215: |-
    [Grisham walks around you, pokes you a couple of times and then opens you mouth and checks your
     teeth.] Ah! A fine, healthy specimen. You’ll do fine. Ahem… Bad doggies, killing good brahmin. Go kill
     the bad doggies for your friend Grisham. Grisham will give big reward. OK?
  216: No, me like doggies. Only bad man no like doggies. Me go away from bad man.
  217: I do it. Go there now!
  218: Good! Remember, bad things go ‘Woof! Woof!’ Good things go ‘Moo.’ Try not to
    kill the good things.
  219: |-
    You seem to be a little short of money. I don’t take credit and I certainly don’t believe in
     giving something for nothing.
  221: You're not going anywhere, missy!
  222: Uh… snarf ick unga bunga. Now take your money and be a good little Neanderthal
    and leave.
  223: |-
    You are quick, aren’t you? Well, if you ask you can retrieve any part of the animal you want.
     Balthus will usually buy the hides, and Rose will buy whatever scraps you don’t want. She uses it to
     make soup and feed her dogs.
  225: |-
    You’ve got to be kidding. Everyone knows Farrel took the watch. Why would he ask you to search
     for it… unless Farrel didn’t steal the watch after all! Or maybe this is a trick to convince everyone
     he didn’t take it. I need to think this out.
  228: |-
    Boy, don’t even try to explain this. I don’t want to hear it. I’m gonna get the preacher, make
     this all lawful like, and you will leave and take my son with you when you go.
  229: |-
    I can’t say I’m not just a little turned on by this, but I can’t have her living in this house
     now that I’ve seen it. You two are going to have to get hitched and leave.
  230: You mind explaining what yer doing with my daughter?
  231: You mind explaining what yer doing with my son?
  232: 'Let me explain it to you gently, pops. There are these birds and bees, you
    see… '
  233: I’m a doctor, and I was just giving her a complete physical.
  234: I’m a doctor, and I was just giving him a complete physical.
  235: This isn’t what it appears to be.
  236: |-
    That’s just great. I’m going to have a smart-ass as son-in-law. Well,, come on… son. Let’s get
     this over with.
  237: |-
    That’s just great. I’m going to have a smart-ass as a daughter-in-law. Well come on… daughter. Let’s get
     this over with.
  238: |-
    Let me see. It looked to me that you and my daughter were imitating the brahmin during mating
     season.
  239: |-
    Let me see - it looked to me that you and my son were doing the horizontal tango between the
     sheets.
  240: |-
    OK, maybe it is what it appears to be. But it’s only sex, it’s not like there’s love involved or
     anything.
  241: I understand perfectly. Hormones, and it being that special time of the year.
  242: I’m glad you understand.
  243: |-
    I understand. I hope you understand that you both are gonna hafta get hitched. Can’t have rumors
     flying about town, you know. Come along and let’s go get the preacher. Don’t make me fill ya full of
     buckshot.
  244: Really? Then why were you both naked?
  245: Germs? I mean GERMS! Very important to be clean when doing these examinations.
  246: |-
    Well as long as yer a doctor, I guess it’s OK. You best get dressed; rumors tend to start
     because of misunderstandings like this. While you’re here, I’ve been having these pains down in my
     anus and was wondering if you could take a look at it.
  247: Err… I’ll take a look at that later. I have another patient waiting for me.
    Bye.
  248: |-
    Yeah. Why don’t you just come with me to get the preacher? Don’t try anything funny, or you will
     need a doctor.
  260: |-
    I knew you’d be able to handle it. Let’s see now, I owe you $1000 for completing the job. Here
     you go.
  300: What the hell is going on here?
  301: Uhhh... Sir, I was just...
  302: You keep your damn hands off of her...
  400: What's going on in here?
  402: 'Holy shit! I knew '
  452: " was different, but there's only one way to make this right!"
  403: 'How dare you sully the honor of my '
  453: ". There's only one way to make this right!"
  404: Uh, Jo, can we just skip to the vow tying parts?
  406: Boy...
  407: Missy...
  410: 'Don''t make me make '
  460: " a widow."
  461: " a widower."
  412: Miria
  413: Davin
  220: You're not going anywhere, boy!
  500: |-
    Why, that's a fine looking animal you have there. Should make some fine jerky. Tell you what,
     I'll just keep some of the jerky as payment. What do you say?
  501: No way! I love Bess. Nobody is going make jerky out of her.
  502: Sounds good to me. When can I come back to pick up my jerky?
  503: Forget it, gramps. I'm outta here.
  510: |-
    Oh… you're one of those. Wouldn't want to take your 'friend' away from you. Nights out in the
     desert would probably be awfully lonely without her. I don't have time for this; I have work to do.
  515: |-
    Great! Come back in about a week. You can pick up your jerky in the smokehouse located just
     outside of the slaughterhouse. I'll leave it in a sack for you. Good doing business with you.
  600: 'Howdy '
  1600: |-
    . I hope you're taking good care of my daughter, Miria. She is the light of my life and it
     would break my heart if anything were to happen to her. Where is she by the way? I was sure hoping
     to see her again.
  601: 'Well, if it isn''t '
  1601: |-
    . How's the married life treating you? I see my son Davin isn't traveling with you. I sure
     do miss him. Maybe the next time you visit you can bring him along. It sure would make an old man
     happy if he could see his only son again.
  602: Uhhh, he's dead.
  603: Uhhh, she's dead.
  604: Miria was alive when I left her, but I'm pretty sure she's dead by now.
  605: Davin was alive when I left her, but I'm pretty sure she's dead by now.
  606: Davin , uhhh, couldn't make the trip, but I'll let him know you said, "Hi,"
    when I see him again.
  607: Miria , uhhh, couldn't make the trip but I'll send her your love when I see
    her again.
  700: Aggg... [A shocked look comes over Grisham's face as he suddenly grasps his
    chest and collapses to the floor.]
  750: Well, I have to get back to work now. I'll see you around.
  800: You have saved Grisham's brahmin.
mcJo:
  101: An average person, of average height, of average complexion. Nothing out of
    the ordinary.
  102: Jo.
  103: Trader Jo.
  104: Sheriff Jo.
  105: Mayor Jo.
  106: Justice of the Peace Jo.
  150: We killed everyone. Even the children… [sob]
  151: Meet us at the Ghost Farm. We attack immediately.
  152: Thank you for saving the residents of Modoc.
  153: What are you doing?
  154: Hey! Leave that alone!
  155: Thief!
  156: Sorry, this trading post is closed indefinitely due to the drought.
  157: So who says I’m here to trade?
  158: I’m new here. What can you tell about this town?
  159: I don’t suppose you have a gold watch for sale?
  160: GECK!
  161: What can I do for you?
  162: I’m looking for a certain item, and I was wondering if you might be able to
    help me locate it.
  164: I’m looking to buy a gold pocket watch. Do you know where I can get one?
  165: What do you have to trade?
  166: What can you tell me about this town?
  167: What do you do here?
  168: GECK!
  169: You’re back! What did you find out about the farm?
  170: I cleaned out your Ghost Farm problem. You can take over the farm any time.
  171: I have a message for you from the leader of the Slags.
  172: Mess-aj.
  173: Farm?
  174: Bad things all gone!
  175: I go.
  176: I’ll be back when I have more to report.
  179: There's a drunkard in the Den who matches Karl's description. Says he used
    to be a farmer too.
  180: Those bodies are fake. Just dummies covered in Brahmin guts. They were there
    to scare you away from the crops.
  181: What am I supposed to do again?
  182: |-
    What? Oh, you must be new around here. Welcome to Modoc. My name’s Jo, I run the trading post
     here at Modoc.
  183: I am on a quest. I seek the holy GECK. Do know where I might find it?
  186: |-
    Well, you’re in luck. I just happen to know where it is. I guess we have some business to
     discuss after all.
  187: Business? Just tell me where I can find the holy GECK and I’ll be on my way.
  188: |-
    Our only business is that you will tell me where the holy GECK is located before something bad
     happens.
  189: What do you want for this information?
  190: |-
    Ah yes, what I want… If you hadn’t noticed yet, our little farming community is experiencing one
     of its worst droughts ever. The rainy season was unusually short this year, and our crops are dead or
     dying from lack of water. To put it bluntly, our community is on the verge of withering away with our
     crops.
  191: Umm… You do know I can’t make it rain, right?!?
  192: |-
    [He chuckles softly] No, no… of course not. I wouldn’t ask you to do something as impossible as
     that. You really can’t make it rain, can you… No, of course you can’t! Anyway, like I was say’en, we’re
     in trouble and we could use your help.
  193: OK, I’m listening.
  194: |-
    There’s this farm at the outskirts of town, where no farm should be. Some years back it just
     ‘appeared’ out of nowhere.
  195: Are you saying that this farm just sprung up overnight? Yeah, right!
  196: |-
    A group of us were out hunting when we noticed the new farm. But that wasn’t the strange thing.
     Soon after, some of us got together to visit our new neighbor, only to discover that there wasn’t
     anybody there.
  197: Go on.
  198: |-
    After many months of trying to contact the owners with no success, it was decided that the farm
     must have been abandoned soon after it was built. So instead of letting the crops rot in the fields,
     young Karl moved in.
  199: 'Hmm… '
  200: |-
    That’s when things got bad. Karl started to tell stories of seeing strange glowing figures
     tending the crops and feeding the animals at night. We all laughed at him, thinking he was making up
     stories. Then one day Karl stopped coming into town.
  201: What happened to him? Did you look for him?
  202: |-
    Of course we did! We went up there as soon as we suspected something was wrong. [He starts to
     tremble violently.] The horror.  Bodies strewn everywhere.  Some crucified, while others were
     left to rot out in the sun. I still wake up screaming in the middle of the night from the horrible
     images I saw that day.
  203: So, let me guess. You want me to go to this farm and find out what happened.
  204: |-
    Normally, I would just leave that cursed place be, but for some reason the crops at this farm
     are still flourishing despite the drought. We’ll starve if we don’t get food soon. Will you help us
     rid the farm of these ghosts?
  205: What do I get out of this?
  206: In return for helping us, I’ll tell you where you can find what you seek.
  207: OK, then let's seal the deal. Cut off your right pinky finger.
  208: Then it’s a deal. Show me where this Ghost Farm is.
  209: |-
    What?!? Is that how you seal a deal where you’re from? We’re desperate and I believe you’re the
     only person that could pull this off. So, I guess it’s a small sacrifice, if it’ll save our town. [Jo
     takes out a knife and proceeds to cut off his right pinky finger!]
  210: |-
    [You stop him just in time.] Wait! I see now you were telling the truth and are truly in need of
     help. I’ll help you.
  211: Now, take your finger and saute it in a light garlic sauce. Very tasty dish!
  212: |-
    This farm is about a day’s travel northeast of here. [He pulls out a map and points to a spot
     northeast of Modoc.] Come back when you’ve found something.
  213: |-
    [Jo calmly wraps his hand in a bandage and then proceeds to pull out a shotgun!] Let’s see if
     you can laugh this off, smart ass!
  214: "[BOOM!]"
  215: |-
    You’ve got to be joking! I’m not going to cut my finger off. I’m desperate, not stupid! Now, do
     you want the job or not?
  216: OK, I’ll do it anyway. Where’s this farm located?
  217: You’re obviously not desperate enough. I’ll pass.
  218: What was that? Did you say GECK?
  219: Unh. GECK.
  220: Me go.
  222: |-
    My name’s Jo. Can you say Jo? No matter; you see that rectangular thing over there? That’s a
     door. Be careful not to let it hit you on the way out.
  223: "[You don’t quite understand everything he’s saying, but you grin and turn
    to leave.]"
  224: |-
    [He seems to mull something over for a bit and then smiles and looks up at you.] Maybe we can
     work out a trade after all. My name is Jo; I run this here trading post. I have some information about
     GECK. You interested?
  225: "[You nod your head up and down.]"
  226: "[You swing your head left to right.]"
  227: |-
    Fantastic! There’s this Ghost… er, farm at the edge of town. It’s about a day’s walk northeast of
     here. Bad things happen there. Make bad things stop, then come back and I’ll tell you about GECK.
  228: I go now.
  229: Well then, we have nothing more to talk about. The door is right over there.
  230: |-
    Yup, that’s one big chip on yer shoulder. Why don’t you come back when that chip isn’t quite so
     big? You have a nice day, and watch out for that door on yer way out.
  231: |-
    Well, then -- welcome to Modoc. My name’s Jo and I run this here trading post. We don’t have
     much; just a few farms, a slaughterhouse, Rose’s Bed and Breakfast, and a tannery. Just enough to
     produce goods to trade. Although that could all change with this drought.
  232: What can you tell me about the slaughterhouse?
  233: Rose’s Bed and Breakfast?
  234: Tell me about the trading post.
  235: Where’s the tannery?
  236: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  237: |-
    The slaughterhouse is run by Grisham and his son Davin. It’s just east of here. He makes the
     best damn jerky this side of the Rockies.
  242: |-
    Rose’s Bed and Breakfast is on the north side of town. Travelers from all over come just to
     sample her world-famous omelets. Some say her omelets can cure people of what ails them. Frankly, I
     think that’s just a bunch of nonsense.
  247: |-
    Just follow your nose and you’ll find it. Can you smell that foul stench in the air? That's the
     tanning vats just north of here. If you overlook the smell, you’ll not find a better place to get
     leather goods. Balthus can work miracles with leather.
  252: |-
    Like I said before, my name’s Jo and I run the trading post for Modoc. I organize trade between
     Modoc and other cities in need of food and leather goods. But with this drought, that could all come to
     an end real soon. We're getting desperate.
  257: |-
    What do you want to talk about? The slaughterhouse, Rose’s Bed and Breakfast, the tannery or the
     trading post?
  262: |-
    Well, spit it out. I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what you’re looking for, and I sure
     ain’t going to stand here and try to guess what you’re looking for.
  263: I am looking for the holy GECK.
  264: Never mind.
  265: |-
    Since I rely heavily on the products of the people of Modoc, I don’t have much to trade for. You
     know, with the drought and all. You still interested?
  266: Let’s do some business.
  267: No thanks, but can I ask you some more questions?
  268: No, maybe later. I have to go now.
  269: |-
    Now that’s a good question. Mostly, I just run this here trading post. But on occasion, I’m the
     sheriff, mayor, judge, and any other official you can think of.
  270: Wow; you must be a very popular fellow to be entrusted with all those duties.
  271: Thanks for the info; I’ll be going now.
  272: |-
    Nah… I just drew the short straw. It seems I was out getting some supplies and when I came back,
     I found out the townsfolk went and elected me. Seems no one else wanted the job. Except for the
     occasional argument, I really don’t have to do anything -- which suits me fine.
  273: Can I ask you some more questions?
  274: |-
    What! Are you trying to be a wise ass? Everyone knows old Corny lost his gold pocket watch.
     He even had me search his best friend’s house looking for it. If you know what’s good for you, you’d
     keep your nose out of this. Good day!
  275: |-
    [He takes the message from the Slags.] What’s this? It’s from the people living at the Ghost
     Farm. This is incredible; have you read… oops, of course you didn’t. There are still some things that
     need to be worked out between the Slags and Modoc, but it’s much too complex for your tiny brain to
     understand, so you needn’t worry about it.
  276: GECK now!
  277: |-
    Well, that could be a little difficult. You see I really don't know what a GECK is. But, I do know
     of a place called Gecko, I've never been there myself but I hear it's somewhere east of here. I feel
     really bad about deceiving you. I wish I could give you more in the way of compensation than this,
     but the best I can offer you is a discount on goods. I'm not too stocked up right now, but I'm
     sure things will pick up around here soon and I'd be honored to help stock you up.
  278: Jerk!
  280: |-
    I don’t blame you for being mad at me, but I’m not sorry I did it. We needed someone for the job
     and you fit the bill. All I can say is "thanks," and send you on your way.
  282: Yes… faaarmm. Farm northeast. Go farm. Make bad things go bye-bye.
  283: |-
    That’s great! I’ll send some people over immediately to start harvesting the crops. You’ve saved
     us.
  284: Show GECK!
  285: |-
    Slags? Who are they? What’s this? [Jo opens and reads the message.] This is incredible! They’ve
     been living underground all this time. They say they’d be willing to trade food for medical supplies
     and other stuff. I don’t know if they can be trusted. After all, they killed Karl and all those other
     people. What do you think?
  286: |-
    All those bodies are fake. Nothing but dummies covered in brahmin innards. They just wanted to
     keep you from stealing their crops.
  287: |-
    They’re extremely sensitive to light. I think a small group of people armed with flares would
     be able to wipe their whole community out.
  288: |-
    I found Karl at the Den. He left because no one would believe him about the ghosts and he was
     scared.
  289: They’re holding little Jonny hostage! We need to attack now!
  290: |-
    Fake! But, I saw the bodies with my own eyes. In any case, Karl is still missing. How do they
     explain that? I won’t trust them until I’m certain they are on the up and up.
  292: They said the person that moved in some years ago left suddenly.
  293: |-
    Karl wouldn’t do that. They probably killed him! No, until I find out what happened to Karl, I
     don’t think we can trust them. I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this, but we’re just going to have to
     take over their farm. It’s either us or them.
  294: |-
    No wait! Let me try and find out what happened to Karl. There must be an explanation for his
     disappearance.
  295: I agree we should attack! Their weakness is their eyes.
  296: |-
    I didn’t agree to this. I’ve found out what’s happening at the Ghost Farm. Now tell me where I
     can find the holy GECK.
  297: |-
    I’ll give you one month to find out what you can about Karl. If you don’t come back within that
     time, I’ll mobilize the residents of Modoc and we’ll take the farm by force.
  298: OK, one month! Don’t do anything rash until then. I’ll be back.
  299: I need more time. It’ll be impossible to find him in such a short period of
    time.
  300: |-
    One month, no longer! I told you we were desperate. Our food supply is running critically low.
     We have enough for one month; after that we all start starving. I’m going to start organizing the
     townspeople immediately. You best hurry!
  301: Please don’t do anything rash until I return!
  302: |-
    [Shocked] The Den! I-I guess we were a little hard on him. I can imagine what he went through at
     the Ghost Farm, with nobody believing him and all. You say he’s a drunkard now, at the Den? If you could
     give him the message that we believe him and that he should come home, I would be most appreciative. In
     the meantime, I believe it’s about time the Slags and the residents of Modoc get acquainted.
  303: |-
    I believe I have fulfilled my part of the bargain. How about telling me where I might find the
     holy GECK?
  304: |-
    [Acting a little embarrassed.] Um… well, you see, I don’t really know anything about this holy
     GECK thing you’re looking for. You have to understand; we were desperate! However, I do know of a place
     called Gecko. It’s a ways east of here somewheres. If I were a betting man, I would wager your GECK gizmo
     is located there. I wish I hade more I could give you, but we're still a poor community with not
     much in the way of offerings. The best I can do is offer you goods at basically my cost. But
     I'd be honored to help keep you stocked for your journeys when I have the goods and  I’m sure any
     of the other residents would be equally grateful if you asked them. Thank you! You’ve saved us all.
  305: |-
    Well, they did kill Karl along with all those other people staked out in front of their farm.
     OK, let’s do it. You’ve seen their hideout and seem quite capable; will you lead us to victory over
     those treacherous Slags?
  306: Of course! For such a just cause, I would be happy to help you defeat the Slags.
  307: Maybe this isn’t such a good idea; let’s think of another way.
  308: That’s great; I’ll get the townsfolk together and we’ll meet you there.
  309: |-
    You saw Jonny there! We’ve been searching everywhere for him. Those monsters, they’re stealing
     our children. We won’t be safe until they’re all dead. I’ll get the townspeople together and we’ll
     storm their hideout. Meet us at the Ghost Farm as soon as you can.
  310: |-
    How can you live with yourself? We are in a crisis here and all you can think of are your own
     selfish needs. Very well, why don’t you go to Gecko; it’s to the east of here somewhere. If anyone knows
     about this GECK thing, I’m sure they would. Now if you don’t mind, I need to meet with the townspeople so
     we can figure out what to do.
  311: That’s great. What were those things, anyway?
  312: Just a community of mutants. If they weren’t ghosts before, they are now.
  313: |-
    They were ghosts. They’re gone. That’s all you need to know. Now, tell me where I can find the
     holy GECK.
  314: |-
    You mean you just went in and killed everyone?! I didn’t mean for you to do that. You were sent
     to  investigate what was happening at the farm and then return with the information. I think you better
     leave.
  315: |-
    We're going to attack, but only as the last resort. We only have a month's supply of food left
     before we start to starve. You have until then to find out what is going on. I won't negotiate with
     them unless I know for certain that they didn't do anything to Karl.
  316: |-
    We're going to attack, but only as the last resort. We only have a month's supply of food left
     before we start to starve. You have until then to find out what is going on. I won't negotiate with
     them unless I know for certain that they didn't do anything to Karl and I have to know their reason
     for staking all those people out in front of their farm. I won't deal with savages.
  317: I think you enjoy killing people just a little too much for my taste. I think
    you'd better leave.
  318: |-
    [Shocked] The Den! I-I guess we were a little hard on him. I can imagine what he went through
     at the Ghost Farm, with nobody believing him and all. You say he’s a drunkard now, at the Den? If you
     could give him the message that we believe him and that he should come home, I would be most
     appreciative.
  319: |-
    I also found out that all those bodies surrounding the Ghost Farm are fake. Dummies, covered
     with brahmin guts.
  320: Now will you talk to the leader of the Slags?
  321: That’s all I know for now.
  322: |-
    Fake! That’s impossible, I saw them with my own eyes. Blood and gore everywhere. But… I guess
     it’s possible, we didn’t… I mean… well [Jo’s face turns beat red.] We all kind of turned tail and ran
     when we saw the bodies. No one actually had the guts to examine them closely.
  326: |-
    Yes, I believe the Slags and the people of Modoc will be able to come to some kind of mutually
     beneficial agreement. Thank you for saving the people of Modoc.
  327: There’s this little thing about my reward? You said you’d tell me where the
    holy GECK was.
  328: 'You need to find out who those people staked out in front of the Ghost Farm
    are. '
  329: Karl disappeared from the farm some time ago. Find out what happened to him.
  330: Thanks, I’ll see what I can find out.
  331: We don't want your kind around here.
  400: "[Letting him cut his finger off] OK, now I'll help."
  410: What's the big white building in the middle of town?
  500: |-
    Oh, that's our town church. The people of Modoc built it to show their faith. Lately,
     there hasn't been much to be thankful for, so nobody attends the sermons anymore.
  600: 'Dearly Beloved: We are gathered here...'
  602: "[Jo turns some pages in his book.]"
  603: |-
    OK, um... Before we begin, is there anyone in this room know any reason why these two
     here before us should not be joined in holy matrimony?
  604: 'Do you '
  605: " take "
  606: " to be your lawfully wedded "
  607: Then by frontier law, I pronounce you attached. You may now kiss the bride.
  608: Then by frontier law, I pronounce you attached. You brides may now kiss.
  609: Then by frontier law, I pronounce you attached. You may now kiss the other.
  625: husband?
  626: wife?
  627: uhhh... other? Yes, lawfully wedded other?
  628: other?
  629: Miria
  630: Davin
  800: 'We''re gonna attack the Slags in '
  801: " days unless you can convince me otherwise."
  802: We're gonna attack the Slags tomorrow unless you can convince me otherwise.
  803: We're attacking the Slags immediately! Are you in or out?
  804: Count me in!
  805: I've had enough of this, count me out!
  806: Let's attack now. The Slags have shown they can't be trusted.
  820: What can I do to help?
  821: I want no part of this. I've fulfilled my end of the bargain. Tell me where
    the GECK is.
  850: I'll be back when I find out what happened to Karl.
  900: Thanks again, my friend, for saving our little town.
  925: You're welcome. See you again.
  1000: You have saved the town of Modoc.
mcJonny:
  100: A small boy.
  101: Jonny.
  102: Blonde hair, blue eyes; your typical all-American looking kid.
  150: Waaaaa!
  151: I want my dog back!
  152: 'Whimper… '
  153: Stranger!
  154: Laddie! I’ve missed you, boy. Thank you for bringing my dog back to me.
  155: Hello, I haven’t seen you around here before.
  156: Is your name Jonny?
  157: What’s your name, little boy?
  158: Tell me your name, you little monster.
  159: Would you like some candy, little kid?
  160: Hello again.
  166: Your mother and father have sent me to find you.
  168: Have you talked to Vegeir about me going home?
  169: Yes. He says he wants your parents to come down and get you.
  170: No, not yet.
  171: My dad said Laddie went with you to look for me. Where is he? I miss him.
  172: I’m sorry Jonny. Laddie died while we were searching for you.
  173: Rose said she would look after your dog.
  174: My name is Jonny. What’s yours?
  175: 'My name is '
  176: "."
  177: My name’s not important.
  178: My name’s Jonny, and I don’t like you.
  179: "[He points to you and starts screaming.] Stranger! Stranger! Stranger!"
  180: 'Very nice to meet you '
  181: "."
  182: See you around, kid.
  183: |-
    That’s swell! I wanted to go home, but Vegeir says his people can’t travel that far above
     ground and wouldn'ttake me… Not that I doubt you, but what’s my father’s name?
  184: Farrel.
  185: Cornelius.
  186: Balthas.
  187: Davin.
  188: Joshua.
  189: Don’t you trust me, Jonny?
  190: Hmm… no. Thank you for bringing my dog back to me, but I have to go now. Bye.
  191: It was sure nice meeting you, but I have to go now. Bye.
  192: |-
    That’s right! Yipee! I’m going home. Ask Vegeir if it’s all right for you to take me home. He’s
     been so nice to me, I don’t want to leave until he says it’s all right. Please hurry; I’m homesick.
  193: |-
    Okay mister, I believe you. Ask Vegeir it’s all right for you to take me home. He’s been so nice
     to me, I don’t want to leave until he says it’s all right.
  194: |-
    Okay miss, I believe you. Ask Vegeir it’s all right for you to take me home. He’s been so nice
     to me, I don’t want to leave until he says it’s all right.
  195: No. I’m going to go play with my friends now. Bye.
  196: I’m not supposed to talk to strangers. Bye.
  197: Yes it is! How did you know? Laddie must have told you. She’s such a smart
    dog.
  199: You’re coming with me, kid. There’s a reward for bringing you back.
  200: |-
    Yes, I think that’s best. Although I trust you, I’m sure Vegeir just wants to make sure I get
     home safely. Thank you for your help.
  201: Please hurry. I want to go home.
  202: No! I don’t believe you! Give me back my dog! [Waaaaa!]
  203: Oh no! Don’t you know Rose uses dog in her dishes!? Laddie is probably a burger
    by now.
  300: Laddie!!!
  400: Thanks for saving me, mister.
  401: It's nice to be home!
  402: Wahoo...
  403: You know, I'm not afraid of the dark anymore!
  404: Thanks for saving me, lady.
mcKarl:
  100: One very drunk person. [He has a sign that says "Will work for food."]
  101: Karl.
  102: He is so filthy that you notice some wildflowers growing out of his hair.
  150: Here, have a beer.
  151: Here, have a bottle of booze.
  152: Here, have a Nuka-Cola.
  153: Hey.
  154: Hey!
  155: HEY!!
  156: The ghosts won’t be able to find me here… [sob]
  157: It’s good to be home again.
  159: It’s Karl; he’s passed out.
  160: He’s going to have to sleep it off.
  161: Ah! The ghosts from the farm have come to gets me!
  162: Spare some change for (hic) an out-of-work farmer?
  163: Sure thing, fella; how much do you need?
  164: How about I buy you a hot meal?
  165: Sorry, I don’t have any money.
  166: What’s your story?
  167: Here cha-ange?
  168: Jooky.
  169: |-
    Oh, kind and generous person. (hic) How can Karl help you today? (hic) [He takes off his cap and
     holds out his hand.]
  170: Here. Here's $100.
  173: Sorry, I don’t have anything for you. Bye.
  174: Do you know where I can find a GECK?
  175: You mentioned something about a garden earlier. Tell me more.
  178: Me go.
  179: |-
    Hey cheapskate! (hic) Come on, I know you gots money… (hic) Just some spare change then… (hic)
     something, anything! Show some compassion.
  180: Here. Here's $25.
  184: Here. Here's $1.
  185: Here money.
  186: No money.
  187: What do you want?
  188: "[Tell Karl about what Jo said.]"
  189: Ghosts, Karl… they’re everywhere. Look, there’s one now!
  190: Gibba gibba.
  191: |-
    You here (hic) to have fun with poor Karl again? (hic) Well, what are you waiting for? (hic)
     Let’s get this over with!
  198: "[In a slurred voice.] Mighty kind of ya… (hic) A $1000 otta gets me by."
  199: Sure, here you go.
  200: For how long, a year? No way; here’s $25.
  201: You must take me for a fool. I’m out of here.
  202: |-
    [Karl’s mouth drops open in surprise] Thanks! You’re a (hic) very generous person… (hic) If
     thars anything ya needs (hic) just come see me. By the way, (hic) me name's Karl.
  203: |-
    Sure, Karl; now that you mention it, I’m looking for an item called a GECK. Any clues as to
     where I might find one?
  204: I’ll keep that in mind. Take care of yourself, Karl.
  205: |-
    What kinds of person are ya? (hic) Playing tricks on a poor homeless farm-(hic)-er. Leave me
     alone!
  206: Yeah… (hic) Some sort of lizard (hic) I hear. Never seen one, though.
  207: No, I’m looking for a GECK, not a gecko.
  208: Never mind. Thanks for the info.
  209: |-
    Oh! Ya means gecko… (hic) Yeah, it’s a liz-(hic)-ard about so big. [Karl holds his hands out to
     show the size. You can’t tell, but the lizard is either 3 inches long or 3 feet long.]
  210: |-
    Let me try to explain. I’m not looking for a lizard called a gecko. I’m looking for an object
     called a GECK.
  212: |-
    Why didn’t you say so? (hic) I know where to get it… (hic) Garden of… [Karl falls flat on his
     face and passes out.]
  213: "[Maybe when Karl wakes up, you can talk to him again.]"
  214: Bless you! (hic) Ya saved me life.
  215: I’m looking for a GECK; can you help me?
  216: Don’t mention it. I’ll see you around, Karl.
  217: |-
    Um… (hic) I’m not real hungry right now… (hic) How about if you give me the money and I’ll get
     it later? (hic)
  219: You shyster. I’ll bet you use the money you collect to buy chems, don’t you?
  220: |-
    Shi… shy… shick… Whatever you just sed? (hic) Take that back… (hic) Whatever it means, it can’t
     be good.
  221: "[Before you can reply, Karl falls forward and passes out.]"
  222: |-
    Thaaaats okay… (hic) I don’t suppose you have any liquid refresh-(hic)-ment. It get’s mighty (hic)
     cold out here at night.
  224: |-
    You are truly (hic) my bestest friend in this whole (hic) cursed world. [Karl proceeds to drink
     the liquid refreshment, at which point he then passes out]
  225: Oh well, maybe you’ll be able to talk to Karl later.
  226: |-
    You are truly (hic) my bestest friend in this whole (hic) cursed world. [Karl opens the bottle
     and proceeds to drink -- and then proceeds to yark all over you.] Ptui! What the?! Are you trying to
     poison me or something?! Get out of here!
  227: |-
    Why, thank (hic) you; you’re so (hic) kind. Why don’t I help you with that heavy purse? [Karl
     reaches into your purse and takes half your money.] Very kind of you (hic) if you needs anything,
     don’t hesitate to ask.
  228: GECK?
  229: I go.
  230: Jooky… hic… It’s a party in a can.
  231: Maybe later, then.
  232: |-
    Gee... (hic) ...thanks. Maybe I can buy a (hic) bullet to shoot myself with. (hic) Course I’d
     have to save (hic) up for the gun.
  233: |-
    You mean… I can go home? No more ghosts? [Karl breaks down and cries. Boy, nothing like seeing
     a grown man cry.] Thank you, I can finally go home again!
  234: Where?! Nooooooooo! They’ve found me!
  235: |-
    Why yes, I had the biggest garden (hic) a person could want. Except (hic) where I’m from, we
     calls it a farm…
  236: Don’t you remember? We were talking about the GECK, and you mentioned a garden.
  237: Forget it, this is going nowhere.
  238: |-
    Hey! (hic) You’re kind a cute! Let’s me and you go out back (hic) and gets better acquainted. I can
     pay… I’ve got a $1000. [Karl leers suggestively to you.]
  239: You do know you’re talking to a man, don’t you?
  240: Sure, but it’ll cost you $1000.
  241: Thanks for the offer, but I’d rather talk about finding a GECK.
  242: Not on your life!
  243: Yer sooo purty... (hic) If you don’t says anything, I won’t. (hic)
  244: "[You can hardly keep from gagging.] I’ve got to go."
  245: OK, $1000.
  246: "[You and Karl slip out back for a quickie. To your surprise, you find that
    you enjoyed it.]"
  247: |-
    [He sobers up quickly and begins to tell his tale.] I used to be an upstanding citizen before
     coming here. I was a peaceful farmer that worked the fields as hard as any man -- until they started
     showing up at night. All glowing, with pasty white skins... Spooked the hell out of me, it did. Night
     after night they showed up and stole crops and cattle alike; I could do nothing to stop them. I know
     what you’re gonna say - "Why didn’t you ask for help?" I tell ya, I did! Nobody would believe me, they
     thought I was crazy. Finally, it just became too much for me. I COULDN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I just up
     and left and came here -- and here I’ve been ever since. [Karl starts to weep uncontrollably. You
     decide to leave him with his misery.]
  248: Oh jeez. I must have dropped my money along the way. Here's $
  249: "."
  250: Zzz
  251: Zzzzzz
  252: Zzzzzzzzz
  253: Zzzzzzzzzzzz
  254: Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
  255: "*snort* *grunt* *snort*"
  260: Oh jeez. I must have dropped my money along the way. Here's $
  261: ". It's all I've got."
  262: Oh jeez. I must have dropped my money along the way. Sorry, it was fun anyway.
  300: I'm going home, thanks to you!
  400: You have sent Karl on his way back to Modoc.

mcLaddie:
  100: Looks to be a border collie.
  101: Laddie.
  102: This dog seems to be really alert and intelligent.
  103: You have no doubt that this dog is probably smarter than you are.
  150: Woof!
  151: Woof! Woof!
  152: Woof! Woof! Woof!
  153: "[This dog seems highly agitated.]"
  154: Nice doggie.
  155: Do you know where Jonny is, boy?
  156: Stay here, Laddie
  157: Let’s go find Jonny.
  158: Did Jonny fall down the well, Laddie?
  159: What’s the matter boy, are you trying to tell me something?
  160: Grrrr! [Laddie takes a vicious bite at you.]
  161: "[Hmm… For some reason he doesn’t like you.]"
  162: Woof! Woof! Woof! [Laddie jumps on you and starts to lick your face.]
  163: "[What a nice doggy.]"
  164: Woof? [You can almost hear the dog laughing at you.]
  165: "[Nobody likes a smart ass.]"
  167: Is Jonny someplace close by in Modoc?
  168: Did Jonny leave Modoc?
  169: Was Jonny abducted by aliens?
  170: I don’t have time to play, Laddie; we need to find Jonny. Let’s go.
  171: Near the slaughterhouse?
  172: Near the tannery?
  173: Near the trading post?
  174: Near the well?
  175: Maybe someplace else, then?
  177: Near Rose’s Bed and Breakfast?
  180: Did he go north?
  181: Did he go south?
  182: Did he go east?
  183: Did he go west?
  186: Woof?
  187: Okay, Okay… Maybe someplace else, then?
  190: |-
    He was playing cowboys and Indians when he accidentally fell down the well and you want me to
     get a rope and go down and rescue him. Okay, let's go, Laddie. [Astounding!]
  191: |-
    He was playing cowboys and Indians when he accidentally fell down the well and you want me to
     use my rope and go down and rescue him. Okay, let's go, Laddie. [Astounding!]
  195: OK, I’ll get a rope and climb down the well to rescue Jonny.
  196: OK, I can use my rope and climb down the well to rescue Jonny.
mcMiria:
  100: Oh my! A very shapely and seductive looking woman.
  101: Miria.
  102: You’re not sure, but the measurements 36-24-36 come to mind.
  150: Bitch!
  151: How dare you show your face around here!
  152: That’s just sick!
  153: I hope you two are happy together.
  154: Why, hello there, stranger. I’m Miria.
  155: I am so pleased you came back. What can I DO for you now?
  156: What do you do around here?
  157: What can you tell me about the slaughterhouse?
  158: Heard any good rumors?
  159: Hubba! Hubba!
  160: If I weren’t so bored, I’d say no. So ask away.
  164: Rumor has it that Farrel stole the watch.
  165: Why would Farrel steal the watch?
  166: Isn’t Farrel Cornelius’s best friend?
  167: Tell me some more rumors.
  168: |-
    Because poor people tend to steal to make ends meet. Farrel definitely falls in the poor
     category, and that would explain the new tools he bought soon after Cornelius’s watch disappeared.
  170: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  171: |-
    Yes, they were thick as thieves, those two. Which is why I think Farrel stole the watch. Who
     else but Farrel would have the access and the opportunity to steal Cornelius’s watch?
  174: |-
    Nothing to tell. My family runs the slaughterhouse. People from all around bring their brahmin
     here for slaughter. After they are slaughtered and the meat treated, it is sold to traders who in turn
     sell it to merchants in various towns. All very boring, if you ask me.
  176: |-
    Have you come to the right place! This town is so boring, there’s nothing else to do but gossip
     and… [She keeps talking for awhile and sometime later you’re able to get a word in.]
  177: What else do you want to know?
  178: What do you know about the Cornelius’s missing watch?
  179: You mentioned something about Rose?
  180: What’s this about a mutated brahmin?
  181: Tell me about Davin.
  182: Let’s talk about something else.
  183: |-
    Ah, Rose. The proprietor of Rose's Bed and Breakfast. Now, you didn’t hear it from
     me, but have you ever wondered why her ‘coop’ is so well protected? She says it’s to
     protect her chickens from predators, but if you look closely it looks as if she’s
     trying to keep something in rather than out. Plus, whoever heard of chickens laying twelve pound
     eggs?
  184: Tell me more rumors.
  186: |-
    It’s really strange, but I hear some ranchers say that every once in a while a brahmin will
     give birth to a calf with only one head. Talk about weird!
  189: He’s family; I don’t spread rumors about my own family.
  192: |-
    Who, me? I do odd jobs here and there. Surely nothing worth talking about. [She flutters her
     eyes at you.]
  193: I really would like to know more about you.
  194: You're right, enough talk. Let's get it on! You know you want it.
  196: |-
    I’m really touched. Nobody ever tries to get to know me better. All they want is sex, sex, sex!
     I get so tired of having wild sex all the time. I’m so glad you’re not like the others.
  197: You slut! I thought you were special for a moment.
  198: You know, I’m just a normal guy like everyone else. Why, my friends say, "
  199: ' you’re just so cool because you’re normal just like everyone else." Yep,
    normal that’s me.'
  200: Well, I’ve never known anyone as interesting as you are.
  202: Want what? Just what are you implying?
  203: |-
    I think you know what I’m talking about, baby. You know this is what you want. [You smile and
     start to undress.]
  204: Forget it; I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to imply anything.
  205: |-
    How dare you call me a slut! Let me tell you, I am very picky about the people I sleep with.
     Why, I have only slept with 10 or 20 people this month! I think this conversation is over!
  206: How disappointing. You are just like everyone else, aren’t you?
  208: No. I don’t think so. I’m tired of this conversation. Good bye.
  209: |-
    [She blushes] Stop, you’re embarrassing me. You are just the sweetest thing. Why don’t come
     over here and sit by me.
  210: I think this going too far. Can’t we just talk?
  211: I thought you’d never ask. Why don’t we get a little more comfortable.
  212: All right! You know what I want, baby!
  213: You are a slut, aren’t you!
  214: I can’t take this anymore! You’re perfect. [She rips off her clothes, your
    clothes, and then…]
  215: "[Your world will never be the same again.]"
  216: That better not mean what I think that means.
  217: Aoooga!
  218: Urg?
  219: |-
    Yup! That’s what I thought. It’s funny how Neanderthal and civilized speech crosses roads on
     this subject. [You don’t even see it coming. But you’re sure the red hand print on your face will
     disappear some day.]
  250: Help, Daddy! Get him away!
  251: Get away!
  260: Help, Daddy! Get her away!
  400: Daddy!
  401: Uh oh!
  402: I surely do!
  410: Uhh...
  411: Uhhh... Continue please...
  412: I sure the hell…
  413: Um… I do.
  450: Uhhh, I think daddy's the one you should be talking too.
  500: Great, I guess this means I have to run this dump now.
  1000: What'll we do now, baby?
  1001: What'll we do now, honey?
  1002: What'll we do now, pooky?
  1003: What'll we do now, lover?
  1004: What'll we do now, sugar bottom?
  1005: No, no, no... Not that kind of distance! I need you to step back a few when
    we're walking around.
  1006: Relax baby, just give me more space when we're walking around.
  1007: I'll try harder, butter cakes. It's just hard to get "us" time out here in
    this wasteland.
  1008: My stuff is your stuff.
  1009: Okay, muffin, but do we have to stop with just the armor?
  1010: |-
    Sharp weapons like knives get me excited although I can use weapons like an SMG in
     a pinch if I need to. Just don't expect me to actually hit anything.
  1020: We need to talk about the distance between us.
  1100: I'm completely healed and ready to go.
  1200: Hardly more than a scratch left on me now.
  1300: Well, I'm mostly healed  -- but I could use more healing when we get a chance.
  1400: I healed myself as much as I could but I'm still pretty badly hurt.
  1500: No, baby; I wanna come with you.
  1600: Sure thing, I'll put it away.
  1700: "[]"
  1800: No, no, sweet pea. I need to be close to you.
  1900: But then I wouldn't be near to you, sugar lumps.
mcPerson:
  100: You see a townsperson.
  200: I sure hope it rains soon.
  201: Our crops are dying from lack of water.
  202: Even the wells have gone dry.
  203: Not a cloud in the sky.
  204: I'm thinking of moving away from here.
  205: Modoc used to be a prosperous farming community.
  206: Life in Modoc is slow. Just the way I like it.
  220: I hear that people have seen glowing figures during the night hours at the
    Ghost Farm.
  221: Did you hear? They found some idiot to go and investigate the Ghost Farm.
  222: I've been to the Ghost Farm. Scary!
  223: Daytime is the best time to go to the Ghost Farm.
  224: Karl used to live at the Ghost Farm. Now he probably haunts it.
  225: People shouldn't mess with the supernatural.
  226: Why would ghosts grow food?
  240: They found out the people living at the Ghost Farm call themselves Slags.
  241: What kind of name is Slag?
  242: I don't trust the Slags.
  243: Maybe I could trust the Slags if I knew what happened to Karl.
  260: I'll meet you down at the Ghost Farm.
  261: We're gonna kill a bunch of murderous Slags.
  262: I hope we're doing the right thing.
  263: We should attack during the daytime, while they're asleep.
  280: The Slags were just like us...
  281: We even killed the women and children of the Slags.
  282: I feel dirty.
  283: The blood stains won't come off my hands!
  284: I hope no one finds out what we did.
  285: What we did to the Slags was wrong.
  300: Did you hear? A powerful priest exorcised the ghosts from the farm.
  301: The harvest from the Ghost Farm should keep us fed for another year.
  302: There's not a drop of water at the Ghost Farm.
  303: Maybe the soil at the Ghost Farm is magic. How else could the crops grow without
    water?
  304: Maybe the ghosts used blood to feed their crops.
  305: I think the ghosts were stealing our water.
  306: I bet things will return to normal around here, now that the ghosts are gone.
  320: We're gonna trade with the Slags.
  321: The Slags have offered to supply water to Modoc during the drought.
  322: You're the one that helped us, aren't you? You're a hero!
  323: You've saved the town of Modoc.
  324: You'll always be welcome at Modoc.
mcProtec:
  100: You see a Slag guard.
  150: Surrender or die!
  151: I surrender.
  152: Die!
  153: Ug!
  154: If you need to see Vegeir, we can escort you to him.
  155: Not now. I'll see Vegeir later.
  156: Yes, I need to see Vegeir immediately.
  160: You're dumber than dirt, aren't you! If you want to see Vegeir, you can just
    go find him yourself.
  200: I don't trust "surfacers.'
  201: Vegeir said not to harm you...YET!
  202: We are charged with protecting our people.
  203: I'm watching you.
  220: I guess you're OK... for a "surfacer.'
  221: Maybe we can get along with the "surfacers."
  222: I'm glad I was wrong about you.
mcRose:
  100: A pleasantly plump woman.
  101: Rose.
  102: |-
    Her gray hair is done up in a loose bun, and she walks with a slight waddle. You can’t help but
     feel relaxed around her.
  150: I’m sorry, we’re closed. There’s been a death in the family. [sniff]
  151: Hey! I’m the only one allowed to go through the lost and found box.
  152: I’m beginning to think you’re a thief!
  153: Thief! Thief! Thief!
  154: |-
    Welcome to Rose’s Bed and Breakfast. My, aren’t you the strapping young man. What can Rose help
     you with today?
  155: |-
    Welcome to Rose’s Bed and Breakfast. Oh my, what a pretty young lady you are. What can Rose do
     for you today?
  156: I’m starved! What do you have to eat around here?
  157: I’d like to rent a room for the night.
  158: You must hear things working here. Mind if I ask you a few questions?
  159: "[You smack your lips with a loud POP]"
  160: Glad to see you again! What can I do for you?
  165: |-
    Oh my! It’s you. Everyone is talking about how you risked your life for us, and solved the
     mystery of the Ghost Farm. Know that you are always welcome here, and of course all your meals are on
     the house. You may also rummage through the lost and found box and take whatever you wish as a special
     reward.
  166: It’s the hero of Modoc! Welcome back.
  167: I’d really love to have one of your delicious omelets right about now.
  168: |-
    That’s what I like to hear. A growing young boy needs to eat to keep up his strength, and I can
     tell you haven’t been eating properly. You just sit right down and look at the menu.
  169: |-
    And so you should be. When was the last time you had a good meal, young lady? Why, you’re as
     thin as a rail. You just look at the menu and tell Rose what you would like to eat.
  170: Brahmin fries. [$5]
  171: Wasteland omelet. [$25]
  172: Water. [$1000]
  173: Brahmin dogs. [$5]
  174: Canis burgers. [$7]
  175: Shepherd’s stew. [$3]
  176: No thank you; I’m not hungry right now.
  177: Oh, I’m sorry, but you don’t seem to have enough money. Why don’t you come
    back later?
  178: But I’m starving! Maybe I can order something cheaper.
  179: Wait! Can I ask you a few questions?
  180: |-
    Back for some more, I see. You must really like brahmin fries. I’m sorry; since you hold the
     record, you can’t enter the contest again until somebody else breaks your score.
  181: |-
    Brahmin fries it is, then. We have a contest on who can eat the most Brahmin fries; so far, the
     record is 36. If you break the record, you don’t have to pay the tab for your meal. You look like
     you’d be able to beat the record with no problem. Are you interested in trying?
  182: That’s okay, I’m willing to pay to eat your delicious fried brahmin scrotum.
  183: I’m so hungry I can probably double that score. Bring it on.
  184: No thanks; just one order, please.
  185: |-
    Oh, that’s just grand. Each order consists of 10 pieces. I’ll have to ask you for the money up
     front. I’ll refund it as soon as you break the record. That’ll be $20, please.
  186: I don’t have that much. Why don’t I try for the record later? I’ll just get
    one order. Thanks.
  187: Sure, I’ll get it back when I break the record.
  188: |-
    [Rose takes the money and comes back with a heaping platter of brahmin fries. They are not
     quite what you expected. They appear to be about the size of golf balls, covered in batter and fried in
     oil to a deep, golden brown. You take a tentative bite of one of the fries. These are delicious! You
     start into the meal with zeal.]
  189: |-
    [At around the 34th fry, you start to feel the effects of overeating. A crowd has gathered to
     witness the historic event of the old record being broken. In an attempt to regain your composure, you
     strike up a conversation with Rose.]
  190: |-
    [You pop a fry into your mouth.] ‘Mmff… splt… mnch…’ Don’t talk with your mouth full, dear. [You
     swallow.]
  191: |-
    How do you prepare these? If it’s not a secret or anything, I know some people back home who
     would love these.
  192: |-
    Oh, it’s no secret. You just dip them in batter, add some salt and fry in grease. [You pop
     another one in your mouth.]
  193: |-
    How do you prepare the brahmin meat? It has such a unique texture. [You pop yet another one in
     your mouth. These are good!]
  194: That’s 37! You just broke the record! [The crowd cheers!]
  195: "[You feel like you’ve gotten you’re second wind and pop another fry into your
    mouth.]"
  196: |-
    [The crowd yells, "38!"] Well, what makes ours taste so special is that you have to harvest it
     while the brahmin is still alive. You just grab the brahmin by the scrotum and ‘snip’ four with one
     cut. You’ve got be careful; the brahmin usually gets riled up at that point.
  197: |-
    [The 38th brahmin tidbit must have been going at the speed of light as it is suddenly and
     forcefully propelled from your mouth.]
  198: |-
    We can’t count that last one, but you broke the record at 37! Here’s your money back.
     Congratulations!
  199: "[You feel sick.]"
  200: |-
    Ah, that’s my specialty. I hope you’re hungry; I guarantee you’ve never tasted an omelet like
     this one anywhere. [She leaves and returns with the biggest damn omelet you’ve ever seen.]
  201: "[You feel revitalized after such a big meal.]"
  202: "[She quickly disappears behind the counter and returns with your order.]"
  203: Can I ask you a few questions?
  204: |-
    I’m sorry, sweetie, I’m quite busy serving customers. Maybe if you ordered something I’ll have
     time to chat with you between orders.
  205: In that case, I’m starving. What do you have to eat?
  206: Sure, but make it quick, dear. I don’t want to keep the other customers waiting.
  207: What can you tell me about Cornelius’s missing watch?
  208: Have you ever heard of a GECK?
  209: What do you know about the Ghost Farm?
  210: |-
    I’ve never seen an omelet the size of the one you served me. What kind of animal lays such a
     large egg?
  211: What’s a canis burger made of?
  212: |-
    Oh dear! Have you been talking to my husband Cornelius? This whole business with the watch is
     just terrible. Cornelius has got the whole town believing that his best friend, Farrel, took his watch.
     If you’ve talked to him, I’m sure you’ve noticed his mind isn’t quite functioning properly. I’m pretty
     sure the poor dear just left the watch somewhere and forgot where.
  213: Now, if you don’t need anything else, I have other customers to serve.
  214: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  215: One moment, I’m still hungry.
  216: |-
    Did you say GECK? No, I can’t say that I have. I have heard of good soup recipe that requires
     three geckos. But no, I haven’t heard of anything about a GECK.
  217: |-
    [She shivers involuntarily.] Stay away from there! I’ve heard tales from travelers about
     rotting bodies tied to stakes, and glowing shapes moving through the fields at night. I don’t know how
     much of this is true, but I do know a while back Karl moved out there and hasn’t been seen since.
  218: |-
    Ah, you’ve had the desert omelet. Delicious, wasn’t it? Some people say it has healing
     properties. [She looks around nervously.] Oh! Some customers just came in. I’ll be right back. [Hmm…
     She never answered your question.]
  220: |-
    Our burgers are made of nothing but the choicest, select, grade-A dog. The meat is ground up and
     made into half-pound patties. And to give it that unique smoky flavor, they are slow grilled over dried
     brahmin dung.
  221: |-
    You poor thing. You look half starved. Come sit down and let Rose get you something to eat. [She
     leaves and returns with a large omelet.] Now, you don’t move from that spot until you finish every bit
     of that.
  222: Sorry, we’re full up. A large caravan has all the rooms rented.
  225: |-
    Really!? You must be really thirsty. I raised the price to discourage customers from ordering it.
     Drinking water is at a premium out here, with the lack of rain and the well drying up. Do you still want
     some?
  226: Yes! I need water desperately.
  227: Actually, I’m really hungry.
  228: I’m sorry, we stopped serving omelets. Some fool broke into our coop and killed
    our… chicken.
  229: I’m really hungry, so let’s see what else you have.
  230: I was really looking forward to your world-famous omelet. I guess I’ll go hungry.
  231: Ahh! Oogie!
  300: |-
    [She quickly returns with a glass of some brownish liquid substance. It appears that there is
     more dirt than water in the glass. However, you are so thirsty that you drink it anyway.] I brought
     a cookie for you to enjoy with that, sweetie.
mcSblBoy:
  100: You see a scruffy little lad hard at work caring for the brahmin.
  101: You see the stable boy.
  150: He seems to be busy.
  200: Sorry, the stables are full. You'll have to look elsewhere.
  201: I'm really busy right now.
  250: Smell? I guess you get used to it.
  251: It doesn't smell that bad.
  252: I guess I don't have to fertilize the fields this year. Thanks.
  300: This one needs some fresh hay.
  301: Got to get some more water.
  302: Whew! Time to get the shovel.
  303: Everything seems okay with this one.
  304: Better keep an eye on this one. Looks a little sick.
  350: Zzz... I'm sleeping... Zzz...
  351: "*YAWN* I've gotta be up early."
  352: Hey, I'm still growing. I need my sleep.
  353: Why don't you go talk to someone else.
  354: Boy, I sure am sleepy. If only someone wouldn't keep talking to me.
mcSlag:
  100: Run!
  101: Help!
  102: We're being attack by the surfacers.
  103: Leave us in peace.
  104: Can't we all just get along?
  150: Go back where you came from.
  151: You're not wanted here.
  152: All you surfacers are alike.
  153: You will not escape.
  200: Groan!
  201: Boo!
  202: Moaaaaaaan.
  203: "*Clank*"
  204: "*Clink*"
  250: We used to live above ground.
  251: What's it like above ground?
  252: It's so BIG up there.
  253: What's the sun look like?
  254: Hello, surfacer.
  300: I knew we could trust you.
  301: Thank you for helping us.
  302: Nice to see you again.
mcSlgExt:
  100: You see a guard.
  200: Vegeir says you can't leave just yet.
  210: Vegeir said it's alright to let you through.
mcSlgGrd:
  100: Seems to be a guard of some sort.
  101: A Protector.
  150: Besides the pale skin and enlarged pupils, he looks to be an ordinary person.
  200: Holy shit!
  201: Oooh! Now that's gotta hurt.
  210: You do know you can enter from the back door...
  211: Bwahahahaha!
  212: I'm not going to say a word.
  213: Oh god! You're killing me! Do it again!
  214: What an idiot!
  215: Hahahaha!
  220: |-
    We have been instructed to take all surfacers to Vegeir. You will not be harmed. Please
     come with us.
  221: Go to hell, I'm not going anywhere with you.
  222: I'd like to ask you some questions.
  223: Duh?
  224: |-
    Let me elaborate on my previous statement. You will not be harmed UNLESS you resist. Are
     you resisting?
  225: Yes, I am absolutely going to resist you.
  226: No, I know resistance is futile. I'll go with you.
  230: Vegeir will answer all your questions. Please come with us.
  231: Okay, I'll go with you peacefully for now.
  232: No, I'm not going anywhere with you unless I get some answers.
  240: |-
    Hmm…I wonder if this is an exception to the rule. No, no, no. Vegeir said ALL surfacers,
     even the idiots. Come with me.
  241: "[Go with the guards.]"
  242: "[Kill them all and let whatever gods they worship sort them out.]"
  250: I'm sorry; you can't leave this way.
  251: This entrance is for the workers.
  252: It takes too much effort set up the ramps for just one person.
  253: If you want to leave, ask Vegeir.
  260: Ogey Dogey.
mcTrader:
  500: You see a trader.
  100: Rose makes the best omelets.
  101: Psst… Stay away from the brahmin fries.
  102: I stop by Rose's every chance I get.
  103: Have you tried Rose's omelets?
  110: Do you smell something?
  111: Good god! What the hell have you been rolling in!
  112: Could you please stand downwind? I'm trying to eat.
  120: Do you mind? I'm trying to get some sleep.
  121: Hey, what are you doing in my room?!
  122: Get out!
  130: Rose is out of omelets.
  131: I'll kill the person who let her chicken escape.
  132: There's no point in coming here if I can't get an omelet.
  140: I don't know why I bother to come here to trade.
  141: This town is dying.
  142: This used to be a prosperous farming town.
  150: I hear Modoc 'acquired' a prosperous farm northeast of here.
  151: I don't know if I want to trade for food grown at the Ghost Farm.
  152: The crops at the Ghost Farm are probably cursed.
  160: I hear they slaughtered innocent women and children.
  161: I don't want to trade with savages who kill recklessly.
  162: After I heard what they did, I almost puked.
  163: Whatever their reason, I don't think I'll be coming by Modoc to trade anymore.
  164: The people of Modoc are killers.
  170: Looks like things are looking up around here.
  171: I'll probably need to hire another team to carry all the food from here.
  172: It looks as if Modoc is going to be alright after all.
mcVegeir:
  100: You see the leader of the Slags.
  101: You see Vegeir.
  102: A tall, stately man. His movements remind you of a cat stalking its prey.
  150: You may leave through the trap door located at the rear of this building.
  151: Please deliver the message to Modoc.
  152: Modoc is south of here.
  153: South.
  154: No, the other south.
  155: |-
    A visitor - how convenient. I’ve been contemplating on a way to make contact with the surfacers,
     but now I don’t have to worry about that -- thanks to your timely arrival. Welcome to the home of the
     Slags.
  156: |-
    How good of you to return. I take it you have delivered the message to Modoc, then. How was it
     received?
  157: They need time to think it over.
  158: They have some reservations.
  159: I want to take Jonny home to his parents.
  160: Have you reconsidered helping us?
  161: I need to ask you some questions, first.
  162: The answer is still no.
  163: I have decided to help you.
  165: |-
    Thank you for helping us. You will always be welcome here. For your services, I offer this as a
     reward.[Vegeir hands you an assault rifle.]
  166: Thank you for helping us. You will always be welcome here.
  167: Would it be all right to take Jonny home to his parents?
  168: |-
    Please let me apologize for the unpleasant circumstances under which we meet. Normally, the
     Protectors would have tried to scare you off. Usually rattling chains and some low moaning is
     enough to scare anybody off, but recently they have been instructed to bring any surfacers they find
     to me.
  169: That’s all right. I’ll just be going now.
  170: What do you want with me?
  171: Ghosts?
  172: You will go IF and WHEN I decide you can go. Not before.
  173: |-
    A simple request. We need to make contact with the town to the southwest; I believe it is called
     "Modoc." Would you do us this favor?
  174: What do I get out of this?
  175: I have many questions to ask before I can possibly take this mission.
  176: |-
    Fair enough. I wouldn’t expect anyone to blindly accept tasks from strangers without first
     learning a little bit about them, first. Ask your questions, and I will answer them as best I can.
  177: Why don’t you send one of your own people to deliver the message?
  178: Tell me about your people.
  179: What are your defenses?
  180: I have heard enough. I am ready to make my decision.
  181: Ask your questions.
  190: Why did you come back to the surface?
  191: Why the big ghost charade on the surface?
  192: What is the purpose of your message?
  194: |-
    Since the Sealing, we, as a people, have changed. Few can bear to be on the surface because they
     are not used to having a black sea of nothingness above them. The sensation of falling upward is so
     great for them that they lie frozen, clutching the ground. But that is not the main reason. All of us
     cannot stand the bright light of that which you call the sun; living underground for so long has made
     our eyes too sensitive to light. We cannot travel far from the safety of our homes beneath the ground.
  195: Can I ask you some more questions?
  197: |-
    Once, long ago, we were once like the surfacers. We too dwelled above ground, until the world
     above caught fire. Our ancestors -- who were part of a secret militia -- sealed themselves and their
     families down here for protection. For generations, down here we’ve remained, safely hidden within
     the womb of Mother Earth.
  200: |-
    Our population steadily increased since the Sealing. It soon became apparent that we could
     no longer survive down here without further supplies. So the Seal was broken, and we once again looked
     to the surface for survival.
  203: |-
    Years ago, someone tried to take over our farm, harvesting crops and stealing animals
     they had no right to. We are not a violent people by nature, but something had to be done. Our
     survival at the time depended on those crops. That’s when we came up with the ghost idea. Smearing
     ourselves with glowing fungus, we were able to scare away this person and any other nosy neighbors.
     Unfortunately, this has been a little too effective. Lately, we’ve been seeking to make contact with
     the surfacers, but no one comes to the farm anymore for fear of the ghosts. Luckily, you dropped by.
  206: Enough! No more questions. Make your decision now!
  207: I am sorry; I cannot help you.
  208: Yes, I will gladly carry your message to Modoc.
  209: |-
    I am sorry to hear that. Please consider yourself a guest of the Slags. When we finally
     establish contact with the surfacers, you will be allowed to leave. Until then, do not try to
     the leave the caves - the consequences would be most unpleasant.
  210: |-
    With the completion of the new irrigation systems, our food supply far exceeds our needs. We
     wish to establish trade with the surfacers and exchange surplus foods for much needed medicines.
  213: Please enlighten us with your wisdom.
  216: |-
    I knew you would understand. Here is a message relaying our request. Please take it to Modoc
     and give it to the person in charge. Return here when your task is complete. I will tell the Protectors
     to expect your return. We thank you for doing us this service.
  217: |-
    How typical of surfacers. Never doing anything for anyone unless there is some kind of personal
     gain involved. Obviously, we cannot trust such a person as you. We will find someone else to deliver the
     message. Although we are not a violent people, do not attempt to leave the caves or you will regret it.
  218: |-
    Hmm… I understand. Such a decision cannot be made lightly. Please keep me informed of their
     progress.
  219: Then do not bother me any more.
  220: About what?
  221: |-
    They don’t trust you. After all, you kill passersby and stake the bodies out in front of your
     farm.
  222: They want to know what happened to the farmer that was living here.
  223: |-
    We are a peaceful people, and have killed no one. Those bodies are merely props we manufactured
     to scare off those who try to steal from us. If you examine the bodies closely, you’ll notice that they
     are nothing but brahmin guts and dummies.
  224: Then what about poor Karl? You know, the farmer that was living on your farm?
  225: |-
    Was that his name, Karl? We scared him off the farm, nothing more. I assume he went back home
     when he discovered the farm was haunted. The Protectors reported him headed west. You might try
     searching for him that way.
  226: I’ll keep you informed of my progress.
  227: |-
    We scared him off the farm -- nothing more. I assume he went back home when he discovered the
     farm was haunted. The Protectors reported him headed northwest. You might try searching for him that
     way.
  231: |-
    I see you’ve met Jonny. We found him wandering in the darkness of one of our deepest tunnels.
     He said he had fallen down a dry well by his house, and then was trapped in a tunnel by a cave in. We
     have treated him as one of our own and he is loved by all -- so you will understand that I am wary of
     entrusting him to a stranger who has yet to prove himself to me as trustworthy. I will return Jonny
     when I am sure he will make it home safely.
  232: |-
    You have proven your trustworthiness without doubt. Despite the fact that we'll miss little Jonny
     down here, we have arranged an escort for you and Jonny to go back to Modoc right now.
  233: |-
    Oh boy! No wonder you weren’t scared away by our little tricks. You’re too stupid to be scared.
     I hate to depend on such an intellectually challenged individual, but we have need of your services.
     Take this message to Modoc. Give to leader of Modoc and try not to get lost.
  300: I'll just be going now.
  301: What do you want with me?
  302: Bye.
  303: Ghosts?
  400: The message was received well. The town of Modoc would like to establish trade
    with your people.
miDclRks:
  100: These rocks are just too big for you to move.

    climb down safely.
  102: An old well with a rope leading down to the bottom.
ncActres:
  100: You see a porn actress.
  150: You see an attractive woman. She seems to be talking to herself.
  151: She looks like she is memorizing her lines. Eventually, she gives up, makes
    an "O" with her mouth, and begins to bob her head.
  152: You see a porn actress. She coldly ignores you.
  200: |-
    I suppose I should thank you for saving the world, but I'd much rather have wild, passionate sex with you. Is that

  232: Hey there, honey! You taking care of yourself?

  241: She crimps my style.
  242: Oh, she's a man-eater all right, a regular cannibal.
  243: Hmmpph. Gutter trash.
  244: She's as talented as a rock and twice as ugly.

    then pretend I'm responding to you.

  316: I don't really care where it goes, just make sure the camera gets the money
    shot.

  474: Yes, I gave your package to that guard, Ramirez… you know that guy's a Jet
    head? He was REEKING of Jet fumes.
  480: Then... why are you here? (Big Jesus wipes his forehead, then takes a deep
    breath.) WHY did you not deliver the package?
  481: Well, I had some questions first...
  482: I'm going to go do it right now.
  483: Uh, you know what? I think I'll take care of it right now...
  490: |-
    (Nods.) Very well. Here is... your payment. A hundred... chips. For a... simple delivery... it is
     more than enough.
  491: It's better than nothing, I guess.
  492: Thank you, Senor Mordino.
  500: "(Squints angrily. A bead of sweat trickles down the side of his face.) They
    are… cattle. No more."
  501: You monster… you just signed your own death warrant.
  502: Uh... just checking. About my payment...
  510: I have no more... work for you. (Nods at the door.) I wish to be alone. Leave
    now... and do NOT return.
  511: Aw, c'mon. There must be SOME other job that I could do...
  512: Okay.
  520: |-
    I… have more work for you. I need someone… (He takes a deep wheezing breath, then wipes sweat from his forehead.) … to collect
     my percentage from the... Corsican Brothers. They are LATE in their payments.
  523: I think I'll pass. Thanks anyway.
  530: Head north up Virgin street. They are across from the gym... if they give you
    trouble... if they make excuses... HURT them.
  531: Okay. I'm on it.
  532: Very well, Senor Mordino.
  540: I said you could... HURT the Corsican Brothers. I did not give you permission
    to... KILL them.
  541: Hey, look... they started throwing down, and I just defended myself...
  542: They were saying bad things about your mother, Big Jesus. I HAD to kill them.
  543: Oh. Guess I misheard.
  551: Uh... yes, but I don't have the money on me. Just give me some time, and I'll
    return it to you.
  552: Yes, here is the money.
  553: No, not yet.
  554: No, uh, I'll go take care of it now.
  560: Then... why are you here? (He wipes his forehead, then takes a deep breath.)
    WHY do you not have the money?
  561: Well, you see, I had some questions first...
  562: Good question. I'm going to go do it right now.
  570: |-
    (Nods as you give him the money.) Here. Half... is yours. Heh. They had already paid me this month, but I like
     to keep them... on their toes.
  571: Hey, thanks, Big Jesus.
  580: |-
    (Senor Mordino looks at you for a long time, then nods slightly.) I have one last job for you. There… (Takes
     a deep wheezing breath, wipes sweat from his forehead.)… is a MAN who must die.
  581: He's as good as dead. The corpse got a name?
  582: Who is this man?
  583: Who is this man you wish dead, Senor Mordino?
  584: Whoa, nobody say anything about murder. Forget it.
  585: I cannot take this job, Senor Mordino, I'm sorry. Goodbye.
  595: |-
    You come to me for work. I give you... work and you complain like a CHILD. (Takes a deep, rasping breath, then coughs.)
     You... are no longer welcome here... in my casino. Leave.
  596: |-
    You come to me for work. You refuse my... offer. (Takes a deep, rasping breath, then coughs.)
     You... are no longer welcome here... in my casino. Leave.
  597: Before I go, I had some questions I wanted to ask you...
  598: I'm not done TALKING to you yet, "Big Jesus."
  599: My apologies, Senor Mordino. I will leave at once.
  600: Why don't you MAKE me leave?
  610: |-
    This man, Louis Salvatore… he has killed many of my men… many PROUD men of the Mordino family. He... butchered them
     in the street like... dogs. (His hand clenches into a fist.) It is my will that this man die.
  611: If you got the chips, he's good as dead.
  612: |-
    Wait a minute. Louis Salvatore who rules the Salvatore family? The ones that have the lightbringers that
     can slice men in half?
  613: I will see the Mordino family avenged, Senor Mordino. I will return when I
    have completed the task.
  614: I can't accept this assignment. I'm leaving.
  615: All right then. I'll do it.
  620: I shall pay you... when Salvatore breathes no more.
  621: |-
    Wait a minute. Louis Salvatore who rules the Salvatore family? The ones that have the lightbringers that can
     cut men in half?
  1621: Well... all right then. I'll do it.
  623: I don't stick my neck out for nothing. I'm outta here.
  630: |-
    (Mordino nods, studies your expression.) Does that... make you afraid? If so, leave. (Points at door.) The Mordino
     family has no use for... cowards.
  631: No, I'll do it.
  633: Call me a coward, but I like breathing. I'll pass on this job.
  640: |-
    (Nods.) That is good. The man is old... a cripple... he hides in his bar, "Salvatore's," near the Bishop Casino.
     He is a... coward and never leaves his room upstairs. When he is... dead, return.
  641: Cripple?
  642: All right.
  650: |-
    (Nods.) The butcher's legs... are weak. (Jesus wipes his forehead, then draws another weak breath.)
     He also has... difficulty... breathing. He takes air through an... oxygen tank.
  651: Oxygen tank, huh? Hmmmm. All right.
  652: I'll be back when he is dead, Senor Mordino.
  660: Louis Salvatore lives. Why have you returned?
  661: "(A bead of sweat trickles down the side of Mordino's face.) You have done
    as I asked? Louis Salvatore is dead?"
  662: He is dead. Your family is avenged, Senor Mordino.
  663: No, I shall return when I have killed him.
  664: Salvatore's too well-guarded. I'm going to have to cancel on this job.
  670: If you... run from this job, I will have you... KILLED.
  671: Since you put it that way, I shall return when he's dead.
  672: Try anything, and you'll be joining the Mordinos the Salvatores butchered.
  680: "So I have heard. (Nods respectfully.) You have done... well. My faith in you
    is not misplaced. Here is... your\n payment. Five hundred... chips. "
  681: Thanks.
  682: That'll do... for now.
  683: And... armor and a weapon you may find... useful.
  690: |-
    (Nods.) Your success... pleases me. I would welcome you into the Family Mordino. (Clasps your shoulders.) Will
     you join our family? Your strength shall be... our strength.
  691: It would please me to become a member of Family Mordino.
  692: 'I can''t join the Mordinos. But don''t get me wrong, Big Jesus: It was a pleasure
    working with you.'
  693: I don't want to join, thanks. I've got a village I have to save first.
  700: |-
    (Nods.) I'm sorry that is your choice. As I said, your success pleases me... I would hate for your skills
     to be used by one of my... competitors. (Motions to his guards, who reach for their weapons.)
  710: |-
    That is good. Do you have... a name by which you wish to be called? All Mordinos... all Reno... shall
     know this name.
  711: Yeah, how about...
  720: |-
    ... that is a good name. (Nods.) The Mordino name has... weight in New Reno. Visit... the Cat's Paw... New Reno Arms... and
     tell them you are of my family... they will treat you well.
  730: |-
    (Stares at you for a long time, then squints in confusion.) Why… do you ask me this? I have… HEARD what happened. (Wipes
     his brow.) The boy took too much Jet and died.
  731: |-
    That's the problem. The Mordinos are the biggest suppliers of Jet in New Reno. That makes you the ones who will
     take the blame.
  732: Do you know where he got the Jet?
  733: All right then. Just asking. I had some other questions...
  734: I see. I think I better be going.
  740: |-
    (Wheezes, wipes more sweat from his forehead.) If the Wrights had the… SENSE they were born with, they would… know
     we are not the only family with Jet in New Reno. We… do NOT kill children.
  741: Just adults, huh? I mean, Jet takes a while to kill someone, but it works,
    right?
  742: |-
    Somebody else might, and they might blacken the Mordino name. You know who might have sold Richard the Jet
     that killed him?
  743: I see. Look, I had some other questions...
  744: Thanks for the information, Senor Mordino. I must be going now.
  750: |-
    (Shakes head.) I… know little of the lives of pushers in Reno. (Takes a raspy breath, coughs slightly.) You… might ask
     my son... in the casino, below.
  751: I will. I had some other questions…
  752: I will. Thanks, Senor Mordino.
  760: |-
    The temperature does not… agree with me. My breathing is… sometimes difficult. In times of stress or other physical
     activity, I tire quickly. Sometimes, I have chest pains.
  761: Really. Well, it's good you don't take any metamphetamines or stimulants, then.
    I had some other questions...
  762: I see. I better be going now.
  770: |-
    I do not know you... you come to me... without anyone's word to give your offer... weight. (Wipes his brow, then takes
     a deep, rattling breath.) I have NO work for you.
  771: C'mon, give me a chance. Give me a job, any job... I can do it.
  780: Not everyone at the Stables... KNOWS they are test subjects.
  781: Uh... come again?
  782: Oh. Uh, about my payment then...
  790: |-
    Ramirez let... four slaves escape last month. (Shakes his head slightly.) That is not good. Within the
     hour, the Jet you gave Ramirez will stop his... heart. It is PUNISHMENT.
  792: You used me to KILL that guy? That's it, Jesus, I'm outta here.
  850: You have collected Big Jesus's tribute.
  875: You have assassinated Big Jesus.
  900: You have become a made man of the Mordino family.
  925: You have completed the contract hit for Big Jesus.

  356: Nice threads. Wish I had it in good with the boss, too.
  357: Any tips for a fella like me?
  358: Family Bishop's been good to me.
  359: John Bishop is gonna rule this town.
  360: Everything's been pretty quiet today.
  361: Storm's coming.
  362: Stink from Golgotha was awful last night.
  363: When we gonna whack one of the other families?
  364: With you on our side, those other families don't stand a chance, boss.
  365: Get you anything, boss?
  366: Any word on the other families?
  367: Um, got any Jet?
  368: I sure could use a drink…
  369: Mrs. Bishop was checking me out again. It makes me uncomfortable.
  370: |-
    Mrs. Bishop keeps looking at me like a slab of beef. I wish she'd realize that I just
     want to be held.
  371: That Bishop girl is one nice piece of ass.
  372: That Bishop girl is trouble.
  373: I heard one of the boys got the Bishop daughter drunk, and Mr. Bishop skinned
    him.
  374: If you talk to Bishop, stay away from the wife and daughter… nothing but trouble.
  380: Heard Mrs. Bishop was looking for you. Watch out, pal.
  381: Heard the Bishop daughter was looking for you. She's trouble.
  382: You don't look so tough, Mr. Prizefighter.
  383: You know, Family Bishop could really use someone like you. Tough. Uncompromising.
  384: You should talk to Bishop about a job.
  385: You might want to consider joining up with us. We're gonna rule New Reno.
  386: I got $20 riding on you!
  387: Hey, champ! That last fight was great!
  388: Saw you fight in the ring. Damn good right hook you throw.
  389: You gonna take the fall? I got $30 riding on you.
  390: How much you bench?
  391: Where do you work out?
  392: Watch out for the Masticator. He has a taste for ears.
  393: I'd get you a drink if I hadn't blown all my money betting on your opponent.
  394: Wanna wrastle?
  395: You don't look so tough, Ms. Left Hook.
  396: Can I see your abdominal muscles flex?
  400: Heard Mrs. Bishop was looking for you. Watch out, pal.
  401: Get me a job, pal? C'mon. I'm the king of studs.
  402: 'Love the films, '
  403: Loved you in Great Balls for Hire.
  404: Loved you in Good Will Humping.
  405: I'm a big fan of your work in Pokeahotass.
  406: Loved "Vault Sex-Teen." It was inspired. A cinematic tour-de-force.
  407: Heard the Bishop daughter was looking for you. She's trouble.
  408: Got any openings at the studio?
  409: Loved "Vault Sex-Teen." It was inspired. A cinematic tour-de-force.
  410: I heard Tommy the Balls wants to give you a private screening.
  411: I loved your last film. Can I help you rehearse for the next one?
  412: Get me a job, and I'll show you some of my moves.
  413: When are you going to stop by and see me?
  414: Hey, you gonna dance here tonight?
  415: Looking deadly, sweetheart.
  416: Lady Luck gonna get jealous you keep coming around here.
  420: How are things up in the Den?
  421: That slaver brand hurt when you got it?
  422: I thought about becoming a slaver, but I hate all the traveling.
  423: You looking for the stables? That's where they keep most of the slaves.
  424: Being in the Bishop Family's a good gig.
  425: You bring a new crop of slaves in, or are you caravaning some out?
  426: You guys need to find some new stock… that last batch of slaves was piss-poor.
  427: You guys catch any more tribal slaves?
  428: What's the going rate for slaves nowadays?
  429: Slaves, brahmin, same thing.
  440: If you're looking for work, we could use someone like you. Talk to Mr. Bishop.
  441: You looking for work? You might want to talk to Mr. Bishop.
  445: Piss off, tribal.
  446: I ain't got no chems for you, tribal.
  447: Go smoke your peace pipe, tribal.
  448: I DON'T feel like chatting. Beat it.
  449: Scram, tribal.
  450: You know who I am? I'm one of Bishop's men. Now fuck off.
  451: You looking to get me mad? You won't like me when I'm mad.
  452: Piss off before I use you for target practice.
  453: Looking for trouble? Keep talking to me, see what happens.
  460: I ain't looking for no tribal ass right now. Come back later.
  461: I ain't got time to do you right now, tribal. Why don't you come back later?
  462: 'No, I don''t know where that is, now piss off! ::Stupid tribals.::'
  463: Piss off, tribal.
  464: Bishops don't talk to tribal trash, we got better things to do.
  465: I ain't got no chems for you, tribal.
  466: Go smoke your peace pipe, tribal.
  467: I DON'T feel like chatting. Beat it.
  468: Scram, tribal.
  469: You know who I am? I'm one of Bishop's men. Now fuck off.
  470: You looking to get me mad? You won't like me when I'm mad.
  471: Piss off before I use you for target practice.
  472: Looking for trouble? Keep talking to me, see what happens.
  473: I ain't beer-gogglin' that bad. Get lost.
  474: You got to be the ugliest tribal I've ever seen.
  475: Get out of here before I beat you uglier than you are.
  476: Go bark at someone drunker than me, bitch.
  490: I *thought* I smelled something rotting. Get that ghoul boy o' yours outta
    here.
  491: Get that stinky ghoul outta here. Now.
  492: That ghoul ain't outta here in a minute, he's gonna be deader than he already
    is.

  100: You see Mr. Bishop.
  150: You see a powerful-looking middle-aged man.
  151: You see Mr. Bishop. He looks grim.
  200: 'You got some balls coming in here. '
  201: 'You got some balls. '
  202: 'Why didn''t you just tack a sign on your chest that says, ''dumb mother fucker?'' '
  203: 'Eat lead, you '
  204: " bastard."
  205: Eat lead, you stupid son of a bitch.
  206: Eat lead, bitch.
  207: Me not LIKE lead taste gross
  208: Shamble off
  209: If that's what you want carved on your tombstone, so be it...
  210: Poor choice of last words.

  221: 'Me '
  222: "."
  223: Me Whoo?
  224: Wander off
  225: I am a warrior on a holy quest to retrieve the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
    Do you know where I might find it?
  226: I'm looking for a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Can you help me?
  227: I'm looking for a place called Vault 13. Have you heard of it?
  228: I thought you might have some more work for me.
  229: Sorry -- wrong room.
  240: |-
    (Studies you.) Even under all that get-up, you still look like one of them tribals… (Snorts.) The boys said you got a
     briefcase for me. From a mutual "acquaintance." Let's see it.
  241: Here you go.
  242: Uh…funny thing, that…seems like somewhere from the door to here I misplaced
    it.
  243: Actually, I'd like to hold onto it. I'll bring it back in a while.
  250: |-
    (Opens briefcase, checks contents, snaps case shut.) It's from Moore, all right. 'Cept this note in here says
     you can't be trusted farther than a snake can shit. You done walked into the WRONG room, tribal.
  251: |-
    (Opens briefcase, checks contents, snaps case shut.) It's from Moore, all right. Says you check out, tribal. Lucky
     for you…(Smiles.)…you come in here with a bad rep, and you're asking for a quick trip to the sky.
  252: Maybe so, but I'm going to be the only walking out.
  253: Well, I delivered the case like Moore asked… now about the payment…?
  254: I'm curious. What's in the briefcase?
  255: Glad everything's in order… look, I've got to be going.
  265: 'Hold your horses, tribal… we ain''t even discussed payment yet. '
  266: 'Hold your horses, tribal… I have some questions for you first. '
  267: |-
    (Studies you.) So…where do YOU know Moore from? He trying to play politics amongst the tribes now? Ha! That boy missed
     his calling.
  268: I met him in Vault City, spreading the word. I offered to help him out by delivering
    this briefcase to you.
  269: I just happened to run across him during my travels. I offered to help him
    out by delivering this briefcase to you.
  275: |-
    Heh… damn human of you… for all his preaching, ol' Tomcat Moore can't seem to step off his soapbox long enough to actually
     to do any legwork. Heh… still, that don't make him any different than any other NCR boy.
  276: He does preach a lot. Still, he seems to make a lot of sense.
  277: He does have a certain…way with words.
  278: |-
    Yeah, well, at some point the work's gotta be done, and they call me to make sure things get delivered…like
     that briefcase.
  285: |-
    (To himself.) 'Course, being able to whip a crowd into a frenzy ain't too bad if you're going into politics…
     (Studies you suspiciously.) You ain't NCR, too, are you? Tomcat's about the only one of them I can stand for the moment.
  286: Yeah, I'm from the NCR, too. It's not the best, but it's a living. I'm pretty
    much a free agent.
  287: No, I'm just a traveler. I agreed to help Moore out because I needed work.
  295: |-
    (Nods at case.) Well, this briefcase was worth it. A little slice of Vault City inside, some of that precious
     tech that frigid bitch Lynette doesn't want to part with…but hey, tribal, I ain't paid you yet. Here's your cut.
  296: Say…I don't have any other jobs lined up at the moment. Do you have any work
    for me?
  297: Yeah…thanks. Look, I've got to be going.
  305: 'No…I ain''t got no more work for you…but hey, thanks for all you''ve done. '
  306: "No…I ain't got nothing for you. Lotta deaths down in NCR recently have made
    my life a little easier…but hey, thanks\n for the delivery. "
  307: "(Nods at the exit.) Now you go on and get outta here. I got other business
    to attend to."
  308: |-
    I deliver that stupid case to you all the way from Vault City, then you give me the brush off? I
     think I'll just take the REST of my payment out of your safe.
  309: No, I don't think I'll be leaving just yet. You still got BUSINESS with me...dead
    man.
  310: All right, then. I'm leaving.
  315: |-
    Hold on a minute there, tribal…(Smiles, taps briefcase.) Ol' Tomcat says you're a team player. I need people like that.
     I got a job for you, if you're interested.
  316: I'm listening.
  317: No, I've really got to be heading on.
  325: "(Checks you out for a moment, then nods.) Yeah…I got a job for you. "
  326: |-
    I have this…"problem" down South in NCR. This fella, Westin, has a big mouth that needs to be shut…permanently.
     Half a grand, easy money.
  327: No problem. This Westin is as good as dead.
  328: Not interested. Find somebody else.
  335: Hold on. I ain't FINISHED telling you everything yet. I want this guy dead,
    but it can't LOOK like he was aced. Don't put a bullet in his skull, don't stab
    him to death, don't do ANYTHING that smells of a hit.
  336: What? How  --
  337: That's gonna cost ex --
  338: Because...?
  345: |-
    Because that's the way it HAS to be done. You piss off anyone down there, make them think that I had ANYTHING to
     do with that son of a bitch kicking the bucket, and I'll make sure no one can identify your corpse.
  346: How the hell am I supposed to whack somebody and NOT make it look like murder?
  347: Forget it… not my style. Find somebody else. I'm outta here.
  355: |-
    That's YOUR problem, tribal, not mine. Do some mumbo-jumbo, mix up some poisonous plants and slip it into his drink,
     choke him in his sleep, push him off a building, I don't care. Just so it doesn't look like a hit.
  356: |-
    All right… and one more time in case I ain't made myself CRYSTAL clear: it's got to look like an accident, or
     it's no good.
  357: Done. I'll be back after Westin has had his… "accident."
  358: I HEARD you the first time. I'll be back after Westin has had his… "accident."
  359: If you don't want me to put a bullet in his skull, that's gonna raise the price
    a little.
  360: You want me to make it look like an accident, eh? Then I need to know more
    about this 'Westin.'
  361: I'm not the person for this job. Forget it.
  370: |-
    All right then. I expect to hear from you soon. And remember, tribal, you don't know me, and we never had this
     conversation. Word gets out, and I'll put you down.
  371: Don't you worry about ME, Bishop. You just make sure you got that cash waiting
    for me when I get back.
  372: No problem. I'll be back.
  380: I'm already paying you more than YOUR life's worth, tribal. Don't push me.
  381: |-
    A thousand or nothing. This is a special job, and I got expenses. I got to get to NCR, arrange the 'accident,'
     and most likely have to shell out some MORE cash for some special 'accident-prone' items to get things done. So
     don't push ME, all right?
  382: Make it an even thousand, and you got yourself a hitman.
  383: 750 chips oughta cover it.
  384: 500 chips, then. Westin's a dead man.
  385: Then forget it. Get somebody else. I'm outta here.
  390: You want WHAT? Tribal, you're lucky to get as much as you're getting.
  391: 'Look, last time: It''s going to cost you more than 500 chips.'
  393: Then forget it. Find somebody else. I'm outta here.
  400: |-
    All right then! You BETTER deliver, tribal. You don't, if you mess this up or if ANYONE hears about this deal, and
     I'm gonna put a knife wound on your body for every chip you asked for.
  401: No problem. Westin's a dead man.
  402: That so? Well, then find somebody else to solve your problem. I'm outta here.
  410: Hmmmm. All right, fair enough…what do you need to know?
  411: Like…?
  412: Where can I FIND this guy? I don't want to have to hunt his ass down when I
    get to NCR.
  413: This guy got any kin, any family? Any witnesses I got to worry about?
  414: What's this guy's health like? Any illnesses?
  416: What does this Westin DO? What's his job schedule like?
  417: I don't want this job. Find somebody else.
  425: He's got a ranch in NCR. Follow the brahmin stink, and you should find it without
    too much trouble.
  426: I had some other questions about Westin…
  428: The more I hear about this, the less I like it. Forget this.
  435: No kids, no wife, no family to speak of. There might be some ranch hands, but
    they shouldn't be too much trouble.
  437: Wait a minute… "ranch hands?" Are they ARMED? And how many is SOME?
  438: All right, that's good enough to go on. Westin's a dead man.
  445: |-
    Probably armed… and as for a headcount, I haven't GOT one. I know he's got workers, and there's most likely more
     than one. Dealing with them's YOUR problem, tribal.
  446: Great, that's really helpful. Look, I had some other questions about Westin…
  447: Well, that's enough to go on. Westin's a dead man.
  455: |-
    Well… rumor has it he doesn't go out much. I thought I heard something 'bout him having a bad heart, so he doesn't
     exert himself much. (Snorts.) Either that, or he doesn't like the sun.
  456: Hmmmm. I had some other questions about Westin…
  457: Heart trouble, huh? Does he have a doctor? Does he take any medication for
    it?
  465: |-
    (Smiles.) I like the way you think, tribal… well, I don't know if he takes any chems for his heart, but I know he'd have
     to be pretty damn careful about which ones he DID take with that heart o' his.
  475: "(Frowns.) He's a brahmin rancher. An animal herder. So?"
  476: All right then. I had some other questions about Westin…
  477: No, he's something MORE. Or else we wouldn't be having this conversation.
  485: |-
    (Glares at you.) He's also a councilor in the NCR congress. That SCARE you, tribal? It shouldn't. Do your job, and
     you got nothing to worry about. Fuck it up, and Westin'll be the least of your worries.
  488: A "councilor in the NCR Congress?" Screw this. Find somebody else…somebody
    with a death wish.
  495: All right then. Don't be a stranger now…I always got work for somebody who
    gets results.
  496: I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye.
  500: You done Westin yet?
  501: You DAMN well better have some good news for me. Is Westin dead or not?
  502: Tribal, my patience is wearing thin. Did you DO the goddamn job or not?
  503: Actually…funny thing, you might appreciate the irony…I had a counter offer.
    Let me show you what it is.
  504: Westin has had an…accident, yes. Terrible shame, a man like that dying so suddenly.
    Now about the money you owe me…
  505: Not yet. I've got a few things to take care of first.
  507: I came back to tell you I won't be doing the job. Forget it.
  515: You stupid bastard…
  516: You dumb bitch…
  517: |-
    you got some balls coming back here after fucking up the way you did in NCR. Why didn't you just tack a sign on Westin
     saying, 'contract hit?' Yer gonna be a long time dying.
  519: Poor choice of last words, Bishop…
  525: Hey, tribal. That job's still open…if you want it. Pay's good. You interested?
  536: Here's your payment.
  537: Got any more work for me?
  538: This settle things between you and me now? If so, I'll be going.
  539: All right then. Pleasure doing business with you.
  545: Hold on a minute there, tribal… you did good. I got another job for you, IF
    you're interested.
  547: No, thanks. I'm not interested.
  550: "(Checks you out for a moment, then nods.) "
  551: 'Yeah…I got a job for you. '
  552: "I have another…\"problem\" down in NCR. Nail one, another pops up. This dead
    man's name is Carlson. He don't know he's\n dead yet. "
  553: 'I have a…"problem" down south in NCR. The dead man''s name is Carlson. He
    don''t know he''s dead yet. '
  554: Make it happen, and it's worth 500 to you.
  555: No problem. This Carlson is as good as dead.
  556: ANOTHER murder?
  565: |-
    Ain't murder. Murder's an ugly word. This is business. Politics, if you will. Both two respectable institutions.
     You want the job or what?
  575: |-
    One more thing: I don't care if you go in there guns blazing with ol' Carlson. He's bound to be holed up there pretty
     tight after Westin bought it, so it doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to be DONE, capiche?
  576: |-
    I don't care if you go in there guns blazing with ol' Carlson. He's holed up in his mansion tight, so it doesn't need
     to be pretty, it just needs to be DONE, capiche?
  577: |-
    And one more time in case I haven't made myself clear: I don't care HOW you whack this son of a bitch as long as he's
     dead and stays that way.
  578: Understood. I'm on it.
  579: All RIGHT…I heard you the first time. I'm on it.
  580: If that's the way it's gotta be…now let's talk about that price.
  581: I'm gonna need some info on this Carlson guy before I do anything.
  582: Oh, so NOW it's okay to go in with guns blazing? THAT would have been helpful
    with Westin. Forget this.
  583: Not interested. Find someone else.
  590: What the hell is this shit with you? I TOLD you the price. We AIN'T gonna negotiate.
    End of story…capiche?
  591: |-
    Look, Bishop. I iced Westin. He was no cakewalk, but I DID it. None of your boys could've done it, or you would've
     sent one of them. You want results? Then you talk to ME, and you better talk a price I want to hear.
  592: 1000 chips. That's all it'll take to put Carlson in early retirement.
  593: 500 chips then. Carlson's a dead man.
  594: Then forget it. Find somebody else.
  600: |-
    All right…a thousand chips. And that's it. I don't want to hear any more bullshit. Next words that cross your lips
     better be 'yes, Mr. Bishop. I'll do it.'
  601: Yes, Mr. Bishop. I'll do it.
  602: I'll SETTLE for 1000 chips. This time.
  603: 1000 chips? Are you joking? Make it 1500 and you got a deal.
  604: Forget it. I don't need this shit.
  605: Forget it. I don't need this.
  615: "(Chews it over, then nods slightly.) Fair enough…what do you need to know?"
  616: Like…?
  622: What does this Carlson DO? What's his job schedule like?
  630: He's holed up in the presidential mansion in NCR. Can't miss it. Finding a
    way in and whacking the geezer is your job.
  631: I had some other questions about Carlson…
  632: All right, that's good enough to go on. Carlson's a dead man.
  640: |-
    His wife's dead, but he's got a son, only seven or eight years old, that lives in the mansion with him...(Thinks.)...the
     place is bound to be guarded, though, so keep an eye out for security.
  642: Wait a minute…how MANY guards?
  650: |-
    Don't know exactly how many. I'd scope out the place, get a feel for the numbers. Of course, dealing with them's
     YOUR problem, tribal.
  651: Great, that's really helpful. Look, I had some other questions about Carlson…
  652: Well, that's enough to go on. Carlson's a dead man.
  660: |-
    No, nothing like that…that I KNOW of. He's a paranoid bastard, sure, but I don't think he's sick or nothing. (Frowns.) Then
     again, he's a pretty OLD guy, so his health can't be that great.
  670: |-
    (Glares at you.) He's the NCR Vice President. Don't let it bother you…get in one good shot, and they'll be fitting him
     for a coffin. Just make sure you're ABLE to get in at least one good shot.
  671: All right then. I had some other questions about Carlson…
  673: The "Vice President of NCR?" Screw this. Find somebody else…somebody with a
    death wish.
  680: You done Carlson yet?
  681: You DAMN well better have some good news for me. Is Carlson dead or not?
  682: Tribal, my patience is wearing thin. Did you kill Carlson or not?
  683: They're fitting Carlson for a coffin right now. Well, what's left of him, anyway.
  695: "(Smiles.) Good job, tribal. I'm impressed…and I'm not an easy man to impress. "
  705: |-
    Not exactly... (Smiles.) What I got is an OFFER: How about becoming part of the Family? I got big plans, and I could
     use you: you're resourceful, tough, and you get things DONE. That's the kind of soldier I need.
  706: I'm interested. What's in it for me?
  707: Thanks, but I can't be tied down...my village and my people are counting on
    me.
  715: |-
    Hold on…you didn't think I'd let you just WALK with what you know, did you? Heh. C'mon now…there's skeletons that
     need to be buried before this matter's closed. Letting you walk around…that's just bad policy.
  716: |-
    Hold on…you didn't think things were settled between us, did you? Heh. C'mon now…by my accounts, you still got a LOT
     you have to pay for. Plus, I can't let you leave with what you know…bad policy.
  717: Don't talk stupid, Bishop. Let me go, or I'll turn your backwater casino into
    an inferno. "Capiche?"
  718: Makes sense. Let me introduce you to my 9mm policy.
  719: '"Bad policy?" I''ll SHOW you BAD POLICY, YOU SON OF A B --'
  725: 'All right then, bottom line: '
  726: |-
    You got a taste for women? I can make sure you're NEVER lonely again. Maybe you don't like the bitches,
     that's fine, I'll get you some glitterboys you can park your meat in.
  727: |-
    You got any young stud you fancy? I'll set you up with all the pretty boys you want. Or maybe you swing the other way,
     eh? I'll make sure you have a partner for every day of the week.
  728: Keep talking.
  735: |-
    You like to fly, get high, wire up? I can get you all of that. You want weapons, new hardware, a better piece of iron
     to plug some schlep with? All that bullshit…yours. IF… (Raises a finger.) IF you join the family.
  736: Sounds good. Sign me up... boss.
  740: All right then…! You got a name you want to be called?
  741: "…"
  745: |-
    …I like it, I like it. Now, if you wanna cash in on your reputation, hit the bar downstairs, or head down Virgin
     Street to the Cat's Paw. If you want to get some weapons, head on over to New Reno Arms.
  746: Will do…boss.
  750: 'Hey… '
  751: ". Everybody treating you all right?"
  752: |-
    Everything's going good, Mr. Bishop. Just thought I'd check in, make sure everything's going well for you.
     See you later.
  753: Everything's going great. YOUR family in particular is showing me…EVERY courtesy.
    (Smile knowingly, then leave.)
  755: 'Hey, before you go…you going to be stopping by and seeing my wife again, tribal? '
  756: 'Hey, before you go…you going to be stopping by and getting high with my daughter
    again, tribal? '
  757: Do a little pow-wow? Eh? (Bishop's smiling, but there's not a trace of humor
    in it.)
  758: What happened between me and Leslie…er, Mrs. Bishop…didn't mean anything. We
    might as well have been…shaking hands.
  759: Hey…look, nothing happened, all right?
  760: What about it, Bishop?
  761: Maybe if you paid ATTENTION to Angela ever once in a while, she wouldn't look
    for attention...elsewhere.
  762: You'd be surprised how much those 'pow-wows' please your wife. It's as if she's
    NEVER had good sex.
  763: That's the LAST tribal crack you're ever going to make. Prepare to die.
  770: What, you think a little SHIT like you can fuck MY wife in MY penthouse and
    say 'NO' when I ask you for a simple favor?
  771: You think a little SHIT like you can fuck MY daughter in MY penthouse and then
    say 'NO' when I ask you for a simple favor?
  772: Nothing happened! I swear! I don't care what she said! I was drunk! And high!
    It was some other hero model, not me!
  773: Get to the POINT, Bishop.
  774: Get to the POINT, Bishop. I don't have time for your faux jealousy, all right?
  775: How about I do your entire family a favor and kill you right now?
  785: |-
    My wife belongs to ME. Anything that TOUCHES my wife belongs to ME. You got a choice, tribal: either give me a pound
     of flesh, or you take the job, and we're even.

  789: All right then. I'll do it…
  790: Your wife ain't WORTH that much.
  791: Your daughter ain't WORTH that much.
  800: |-
    Hey, but before you go…I like the look of your weapons there, tribal…kind of reminds me of this rumor I heard not too
     long ago.
  801: Rumor?
  805: 'Yeah…rumor in the wastes is somebody that matches your description wiped out
    those raiders south of Vault City. '
  806: 'Had a big-ass mutant with a vise connected to his shoulder with him. '
  807: 'Had some tribal with a bone through his nose with him. '
  808: 'Had some robot with a brain in a dome with him. '
  809: What you got to say to that?
  810: Say to wut?
  811: Oh that was ME! ME! I did it!
  812: Yeah, that was me.
  813: What have I got to say to that? Nothing. Why?
  814: Big desert, lots of raiders. Could be you're mistaken.
  815: Big desert, lots of character models look like me. Could be you're mistaken.
  820: 'Well, you must be some kind of ballsy mother fucker to waste all those boys
    by your lonesome. '
  821: 'Well, you must be some kind of badass bitch to waste all those boys by your
    lonesome. '
  822: Could be I don't LIKE what you did down there. COULD be I had some of my best
    people in that camp.
  823: Could be that if any guns get drawn in here, you'll FIND out what happened
    to those raiders personally.
  824: Maybe you should have trained them better. It was like shooting a bunch of
    geckos. DRUNK geckos.
  825: I didn't know they were working for you. They didn't exactly want to talk.
  835: 'That so? I think you were there. I think you''re responsible. '
  836: 'Way I see it, you OWE me big, tribal. You gotta do the work of twenty men
    to pay off that debt. '
  837: You take the job, then…maybe…we can call it even.
  838: Not from where I'm standing. I figure one gunshot to your head oughta clear
    the debt.
  840: They attacked ME, Bishop. I don't owe you anything, and I'm not going to do
    your dirty work. Understand?
  900: You have delivered Thomas Moore's briefcase.
  925: You have assassinated Westin.
  950: You whacked Carlson.
  975: You have become a made man of the Bishop family.

    mean, they only deal in alcohol, they have no casino or chem trade, and their

    Richard? We found him dead in one of the gutters like one of those jet crashers. Near as we can figure,
     someone pumped him with chems until he was dead.

    took too much?"

     it right here, huh?!

  422: Don't blind yourself to the possibility he might have been taking it. Jet is
    extremely habit-forming.

    time a little truth comes along and bites you in the ass.

    family themselves. Bastards make tons of Jet.

  467: Which of the dealers do you think sold it to Richard?
  468: 'I see. I better be going. '

    Could have been any one of them: Jagged Jimmy J, that scarred prick at the corner of Virgin Street, or Renesco
     'the Rocketman,' that weasely old shit who sells Jet outta that fortified shell up on the West Side.

    you. And that's no small thanks, understand?
  488: 'I understand. Catch you later, Chris. '
  495: 'Jules at the head of town also sells Jet, but he mostly sells to tourists…then
    there''s Little Jesus Mordino: he mighta pushed chems on Rich while Rich was out
    alone. He hangs out at the Desperado.'

     world. But enough about this place…you looking for a job, honey-tits?
  655: How do you "film?"  I mean, c'mon…you'd need cameras, film, projectors…where
    would you get all that stuff?
  657: No thanks. I have to be going.
  658: Just checking. I've been feeling a little drained, lately.
  670: |-
    We lucked out…we don't NEED any of that stoneage crap. We stumbled across a WORKING porno…er, holo…graphic projector.
     No bulky equipment, no fuss…and no unsightly mess.
  671: Reeeeally…what specs does the projector have?
  672: 'I see…well, look: I''m interested in a job, if you''re still offering.'
  673: Nice talking to you, but I have to be going.
  680: |-
    Well…we ain't hit capacity on the QEWB drive yet - near as I can tell, it's about a 300 GB high density memory cube.
     Even though the Winblows 57 O.S. eats up 70-75% of that, we could film for a hundred years on that cube.
  681: Where is this cube now? Can I see it?
  683: Wow. That's a LOT of porn. I think I'm going to go think about that for a while.
  690: |-
    No, we try and keep everybody outta the film room…everybody wants to throw in their two cents when it comes to
     editing and storage. 'Sides, the cube's gold to us - wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
  692: Makes sense. God knows what use some thief could put that cube to if they got
    their hands on it. Oh, well. Bye!
  700: X-cellent! A-course, I'll need ta see what yer made of, a little try-out to
    see how you get over the 'hump.' You game, pal?
  701: X-cellent! A-course, I'll need ta see what yer made of, a little try-out to
    see how you get over the 'hump.' You game, honey-tits?
  702: Sure.
  703: Uh, no thanks. I've changed my mind. Some other time.
  710: Then get the hell outta here, you little shit! We don't need you! Get lost!
    You'll never work in porn again!

     we free ourselves from our physical bodies?
  337: Me WANNA talk but you not LET me BYE
  338: |-
    Well, I did stop the Enclave's plans for murdering everyone in the world, defeated the President, blew up
     their base, and barely escaped with my life.
  339: I've fought in the boxing ring.
  340: 'I''ve turned out a few movies. Heard of '
  5340: "?"
  341: 'I''m in tight with the '
  5341: " family."
  342: No, I don't think so, Jimmy. We here to deal or what?
  343: No, I don't think so. Hey, I wanted to ask you something…
  344: No, I've got to go. Catch you later, Jimmy.
  360: |-
    That's it! I KNEW I'd seen you somewhere before! Damn, why didn't you pull from the start, put Jimmy in his place…?!
     Hell, what can I do for you?
  361: Um...me forgot. Me go.
  363: Well, I'm looking for some Jet…
  364: Hey, I wanted something else…
  365: I've got to go. Catch you later, Jimmy.
  375: "(Jimmy falls into a stunned silence. You think you've paralyzed his brain.)"
  376: "(Steal everything he has.)"
  377: " work here is done."
  385: Jagged Jimmy J's got a lot of love, my pilot friend, but the world don't always
    love Jagged Jimmy J back, see?
  386: I hear you. I hear you.
  387: Don't I know it. Sometimes the world's a cruel place.
  388: That's a GREAT story. Say, Jimmy, I had some other questions…
  389: Good story. Now you got some Jet, I got some chips…we gonna deal?
  390: Good story. I got to go though, Jimmy.
  400: |-
    (Points at his scar.) I got this while I was stopping this one big UGLY son of a bitch from hitting this chick cuz she don't like
     the way he was touching her, right?
  401: Really? What happened?
  402: Serious? Man, guys who beat up women deserve to be laid low.
  415: |-
    (Gets into fighting stance.) So's I step in, right, and he pulls a KNIFE on ol' JJ! I ain't got nothing on me but my bare hands, right? So he gets
     in a lucky cut before I…*BAM!* Canceled his ass!
  416: Oh, really? Jules says you were 'flying' on Jet and sliced up your face trying
    to shave with your combat knife.
  417: No shit? I don't think I'd have had the iron to step in like that. Hell, that
    man coulda KILLED you.
  418: GREAT story. Hey, I had some other questions…
  419: Yeah...look, I got some chips…we gonna deal?
  420: Good story...so good I have to leave.
  430: |-
    Wha...? Well, Jules can kiss my natural black ass, and it'd be the only ass in town he AIN'T kissed yet. He don't know SHIT. He don't
     even have the balls to talk shit to my face. YOU decide who's telling the truth.
  431: Yeah, yeah…. Look, you got some Jet, I got some chips…we gonna deal?
  432: Yeah, yeah….say, Jimmy, I had some other questions…
  433: Look, Mr. Big Talk, we gonna deal or sit here and listen to you jabber on all
    day?
  434: Well, I've heard enough, Jimmy. You watch yourself shaving, hear?
  435: All right then. Catch you later, Jimmy.
  445: He almost did, too! Y'know, when I got into it, I wasn't thinking like 'I'm
    gonna be mister brave man' an' all, but…
  446: You just did what was natural to you, right?
  447: Uh-huh. Look, I had some other questions…
  448: I have to be going. Catch you later, Jimmy.
  455: |-
    Yeah…yeah…I just saw something wrong, and I had to do SOMETHING, right? No way could I let something like that go on
     while I was on the scene, y'know?
  456: You got BALLS to do what you did, Jimmy. Most people would've just hung their
    heads, walked away.
  457: I understand. Say, I had some other questions…
  465: I LIKE people, and I AIN'T like it when somebody messes with somebody else
    just cause they can. That shit's just WRONG.
  466: You're a brave man, Jimmy, a brave man. Wear your scar with pride. Say, can
    I see what you have in stock?
  467: You're right about that. Say, I had some other questions…
  475: Hell, my pilot friend, I like you, so don't you be pulling up that barter screen
    with its fuses and wires and all.
  476: Uh…okay…then how are we gonna deal…?
  480: |-
    Look, this is bad business an' all, and don't go telling nobody 'bout it, but lemme give you some Jet
     'tween friends. Next time, a-course, you gotta pay, but this one's on Jagged Jimmy J, all right?
  481: Thanks, Jimmy. Say, can I see what else you have in stock?
  482: Hey, thanks. Say, I had some other questions…
  483: All right then. Thanks, Jimmy.
  490: |-
    Glad you asked, my pilot friend, glad you asked. See, all them OTHER dealers, right, they get their shit second hand,
     watered down, diluted with all sorts o' shit.
  491: But your Jet, on the other hand…
  492: Actually, forget I asked. I had some other questions…
  500: |-
    I used to get it from the god himself, Myron, see, but he up and left...or got aced. Now I mostly peddle straight from the
     Mordino Family.
  501: |-
    Well, I USEDTA get it from ol' Myron, before he got all uppity and left the business…ain't that right, Myron? Ha!
     Now I mostly peddle run-o-the-mill Mordino shit.
  502: Interesting. I had some other questions…
  510: |-
    Me, I got ties to the CREATOR, my pilot friend. I get my Jet straight from the brainiac, the living god of chem n' compounds,
     MYRON.
  511: Myron?
  512: Interesting. Say, I had some other questions…
  513: Myron, huh? Can I meet this…living god?
  514: Really? Well, I'll be sure to come back and buy some later on. Thanks, Jimmy.
  520: |-
    He's Family Mordino's golden boy. He MADE Jet. Buying from Jagged Jimmy is like buying from Myron himself, y'hear? That's
     why J-J got the pure Jet. The BEST Jet.
  521: Sounds good. Let's deal.
  523: Think I could meet this Myron?
  530: |-
    Hell, no! The Mordinos got that boy locked up tighter than a New Reno virgin. No way they gonna let anybody gonna touch
     their livelihood, know what I'm saying?
  531: I hear you. So how much security they got on this guy?
  532: Except that I heard Myron has a lot of prostitute…friends. How does that happen
    if he's locked up so tight?
  533: Understood. Say, I had some other questions…
  534: Interesting. Thanks for the information, Jimmy.
  540: |-
    Guards, guards, and more guards. Plus, tightest electronic security in New Reno. You'd be lucky if you even HEAR
     about somebody seeing Myron, he's so well-guarded.
  541: Well-guarded, huh? Where, exactly?
  543: I see. Say, I had some other questions…
  550: |-
    They got him stationed at this place called the "Stables," to the North, outside city limits. I only been there
     once - they never let me past the gates, and I WORK for the Family.
  551: Come on, there must be some way I could see him.
  554: |-
    The Stables, huh? Outside of town to the North…(I'll just record that on the Pip Boy real quick here)…thanks for the
     lowdown, Jimmy.
  560: |-
    Beats the hell outta me, friend. I SELL for the boy, and I ain't hardly see him but once or twice from a hundred yards
     away. Big Jesus Mordino don't let nobody near him who ain't tight with the family.
  561: All right then, let's deal.
  564: All right then. Thanks, Jimmy. I got to be going.
  570: Now, that's a…hole…different story, my pilot friend. Oh my, yes.
  571: I think this is a story I want to hear. C'mon, Jimmy…
  572: Nevermind. I had some other questions…
  573: I don't think I have time for this story, Jimmy. I got to be going.
  580: See, Myron is well taken care of…Mordinos give their little livelihood the
    BEST of New Reno.
  581: And by that, you mean…?
  582: You mean prostitutes, don't you? Out of idle curiosity, where do the Mordinos
    get these prostitutes and how are they chosen?
  584: I see. Thanks, Jimmy. I got to be going.
  590: |-
    Th' Mordinos deliver whores to the Stables personally, then escort them out again. Heh-heh. Myron's barely nineteen, and
     he's got the hormones o' twenty…twenty MEN, that is.
  592: Interesting….say, out of IDLE curiosity, where do the Mordinos get these prostitutes
    and how are they selected?
  600: |-
    (Shrugs.) One of Mordino's boys cruises the Cat's Paw down the street, I hear, picks one Myron might like from Miss Kitty's
     stock…(Jimmy suddenly stops talking. He squints at you and frowns.) Wait a minute...
  601: What's wrong?
  602: Uh…nevermind. Say, I had some other questions…
  603: Uh, well, thanks for the information, Jimmy.
  610: |-
    Why you want to know shit like that? I got Jet, that's all YOU need to know. You don't need to know nothing about Myron,
     or what he had for dinner, or who he does 'fore he goes to bed at night.
  611: |-
    Why you want to know shit like that… (Pauses, then smiles and looks you up and down.) Aw, now I catch your drift.
     You gonna go straight to the source for yo Jet, right, sister?
  612: Not at the moment. Let's see what you got, Jimmy.
  613: Forget it, then. Let's deal.
  614: Nevermind then. I had some other questions…
  615: I might. Say, I had some other questions…
  616: No, just curious. Thanks, Jimmy. I got to be going.
  617: All right then. Later, Jimmy. I got to be going.
  625: |-
    Hell, all's I'M sayin' is Jimmy likes his buyers happy and ALIVE. Draw yer own conclusions, my pilot friend.
     Is breathin' more important to you than shaving a few chips off your next Jet purchase?
  626: Understood. We gonna deal?
  627: Know anything about this empty Jet canister?
  628: I don't think the kid ODed on Jet. I think he was poisoned.
  629: I had some other questions…
  635: Aw, so NOW it comes out, does it?! You wanna know if ol' Jimmy got something
    to do with that, huh?!
  636: No, I was just ask --
  637: All right, nevermind that. We gonna deal?
  638: Look, I had some other questions --
  639: Thanks for the tip, Jimmy. I'd better be go --
  645: |-
    FUCK you! I sell CLEAN shit! You wanna know who poisoned that Wright kid, you go ask that old fool Renesco, or that
     weasel Jules, and you see what they say!
  646: Okay, okay. Calm down --
  648: All right, all right. Look, I had some other quest --
  655: |-
    You listen, and you listen GOOD. If I hear you were talkin' shit 'bout me havin' anything to do with that Wright kid's
     death, I'll make sure you have a grave in Golgotha right next to him.
  656: Renesco said you sell Jet laced with arsenic.
  659: No problem. Look, I had some other questions…
  660: Dead, huh? Like Richard?
  661: |-
    Don't you threaten ME, you little cocksucker. Mess with me, and I'll kill you so many times you'll
     think you were Lazarus.
  662: Easy, Jimmy. Nobody's going to be talking.
  663: I'm not going to say anything, Jimmy. I'm going now, see? I'm going.
  675: |-
    (Takes canister, studies it.) Naw, I... (Sniffs nozzle, then frowns.) Sheeee-it. This Jet's got radscorp juice in it.
     Whoever was sucking on this ain't long for this world... (Hands canister back.)
  676: It's poisoned?
  677: Hmmm. I had some other questions…
  678: I see. Thanks.
  685: Hell, yes! Gotta be careful in this town with shit like that being passed around...that's
    why Jimmy always says --
  686: Any idea where this might have come from?
  695: |-
    Naw, I don't...look, now, don't be spreading the word that's mine...if I were you, I'd ask Jules and Renesco
     about it...but you didn't hear that from me, right?
  696: All right then. I had some other questions…
  697: Renesco and Jules, huh? I'll ask them about it. Thanks for the tip.
  705: Don't surprise me none.
  706: What are you saying?
  707: I see. I had some other questions…
  708: Nevermind, then.
  715: Yeah, he WOULD say that, cause he knows ALL about it.
  716: What do you mean?
  725: |-
    What do I mean? I mean Jimmy likes his buyers happy and ALIVE. Renesco don't draw no distinctions 'tween the two,
     though...so YOU draw yer own conclusions, my pilot friend.
  727: Thanks for the tip, Jimmy. I'd better be going now.
  800: You have discovered that Richard Wright was poisoned.
ncJules:
  150: |-
    You see a black man in a worn suit. When he catches your eye, he smiles, his gold tooth
     glittering in the light of the lamps.
  151: You see Jules.
  200: Let Jules show you 'round, slaver.
  201: Go see the Mordinos, slaver. They're the market for most o' the slaves that
    come to New Reno.
  202: New in Reno, slaver? Worth your time to talk ta me.
  203: Hey, slaver. Come talk to me for a second.
  204: Slaver, if you ain't talked to Jules, you don't know HALF of what New Reno

  205: Yo, slaver! You got a minute?
  206: Looking for something, slaver? Let Jules help you find it.
  220: New in town? Worth your time to talk ta me, friend.
  221: Hey, you. Come talk to me for a second.
  222: Friend, if you ain't talked to Jules, you don't know HALF of what New Reno

  223: New Reno's a dangerous place, friend. Let me fill you in on what's healthy
    and what's not.
  224: Yo! You got a minute, friend?
  225: Friend, you and me got to have some words. Let Jules show you around.
  226: Looking for something, friend? Let Jules help you find it.
  240: Hallelujah! I always KNEW you would be the hero! I KNEW it!
  241: Hero comin' through! Make way, make way!
  242: Come say hello to your old friend Jules now.
  243: You gonna share some o' your fame with me, my he-ro friend?
  244: You gonna share some o' your new wealth with me, my he-ro friend?
  245: Jules always treated you right…so tell everybody you know me, awright he-ro?
  246: Hear the Corsican Bros are lookin' for you, he-ro…
  260: Daaamn. I think you and I should be friends.
  261: How the hell do you go to the bathroom with that thing on?
  262: What the hell is THAT? A walking car?
  263: Them junkies are gonna flip when they see you coming in that thing.
  280: You gonna put in a good word to the boss man for me, brother?
  281: Yo, brother, now you ain't forgotten your friend Jules on your rise to the
    top, have you?
  282: Yo, dark and deadly! Looks to me like New Reno's been GOOD to you!
  283: If your boss needs someone to deal Jet for him, I'm here…
  284: You gonna put in a good word to the boss man for me, sister?
  285: Yo, sister, now you ain't forgotten your friend Jules on your rise to the top,

  343: Damn, look at THIS shining star…so bright I can barely see you, sister!
  344: Yo! Looks to me like New Reno's been GOOD to you!
  345: How about you let me star in a few scenes with you, sweetness?
  346: Yo, now you ain't forgotten your friend Jules on your rise to the top, have

    I saw you.
  349: You're one classy lady when you're bucking and moaning on the screen.
  350: Words cannot describe how hard I am to see you.
  365: That a MUTANT?
  366: That mutant's one big muthuh.
  367: Mutants in New Reno? Must mean a storm's comin'…
  368: Mutants from the wastes? Wasn't that eighty years ago?
  369: That mutant ain't gonna last long in Reno…
  370: Gonna be a murder if the families spot that mutant…
  380: Is that some kind of slot machine that's following you around?
  381: Is that a robo-slot machine?
  382: Does your robot do tricks? Uh…magic tricks, I mean.
  383: You sellin' that robot? You can keep the brain.
  390: A ghoul…thought I smelled somethin.

  402: That dog is the first good reason I've ever seen for leash laws.
  403: Is that dog part metal? I thought I was a bad-ass.
  404: Wonder if you can breed cyber-dogs…
  410: Reno can have a man for breakfast. Or a buffet.
  411: A man can lose himself here, and Jules is the one who can find you.
  412: This town can strip the unprepared…talk to me and I'll set you straight.

    Name's Jules, and I would be MOST pleased to make your acquaintance, show you around, and set you up with whatever

  461: |-
    Name's Jules, and may I say I have NEVER seen a more beautiful woman stride down this street until this moment. It'd

  462: Hey, hey, hey, welcome back! What is it you need from Jules, my friend?
  463: Me looking for… um. Me forget again
  464: Wander off
  465: All right. How can you help me?
  466: Well, I had some questions…
  467: Know what happened to Mr. Wright's son, Jules?
  468: Jules, have you seen my car? I parked it here a while ago, and now it's gone.
  469: |-
    Look…"Jules," is it? You obviously expect something out of this conversation, so level with me up front.
     What are YOU looking for?
  470: So, I'm curious…what do YOU get out of playing tour guide, Jules?
  471: Not today, Jules, thanks.
  472: Nothing, thanks. See you, Jules.
  480: Eh... don't strain the brain, little brother. You just don't hurt yourself,

  481: Eh... don't strain the brain, little sister. You just don't hurt yourself,
    now, hear?
  482: Hi tee hi tee hi tee ho
  490: |-
    I can get you ANYTHING you need, brother. If you need to fly, get high, slide down low in a luscious ho, Jules knows
     where to GO. Question is: I gots the treasure, so what's YOUR pleasure?
  491: |-
    Anything you need, Jules is the MAN, sister. If you need to fly, get high, slide down low, Jules knows where to GO.
     Question is: I gots the treasure, so what's YOURS pleasure?
  492: |-
    Anything you need, Jules is the MAN, my sweet sister. If you need to fly, get high, slide down low, Jules knows where
     to GO. Question is: I gots the treasure, so what's YOUR pleasure?
  493: Sure thing, sure thing... I gots the treasure, so what's YOUR pleasure?
  494: Can you tell me a little about New Reno?
  495: Where can I get some chems?
  496: I'm looking to buy some heavy firepower.
  497: I'm looking for supplies.
  498: I want to get laid.
  499: I'm looking for a place called Vault 13.
  500: I'm looking for my tribe. They've been kidnapped.
  501: Do you know how to fix an oil tanker?
  502: I'm looking for a Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
  503: Nothing today, thanks.
  515: |-
    Can Jules TELL you 'bout New Reno? Hell, yes! FIRST thing you should know: Reno's ruled by four families: Mordinos,
     the Salvatores, the Bishops and the Wrights. Each o' them got a slice of th' Reno pie.
  516: 'Reno''s got four families: Mordinos, Salvatores, Bishops, Wrights. Each o''
    them got a slice of th'' Reno pie.'
  517: Tell me about the families.
  518: What about the law?
  519: Actually, I had some other questions…
  520: Interesting. Thanks for talking with me.
  525: Ain't no law, ain't no po-lice, ain't no sheriff, ain't no government body.
    JUST the families.
  527: Who keeps order in Reno then?
  528: I see. I had some other questions…
  535: |-
    The Families keep things running smooth. They don't LIKE trouble in Reno 'cause it hurts the tourist trade, and that
     means less money for them. Don't make trouble and cover yer bets, you'll stay off Golgotha.
  537: Golgotha?
  545: |-
    Yeah, this graveyard outside o' town. It's where they put debtors and people who've crossed the families.
     They just string 'em up on posts and let 'em die slowly in the sun. Not my choice a' dying. Stinks like hell out there.
  547: Interesting. Say, I had some other questions…
  548: Sounds great. Thanks for the information.
  555: Well, now, ANOTHER thing you gotta know about New Reno is nothin's free. If
    it is, ex-amine the merchandise.
  556: Well, now, that kind of info don't come cheap. You got the chips? Then you
    got my attention.
  557: Pay him 25 chips.
  558: Pay him 50 chips.
  559: Pay him 75 chips.
  560: Pay him 100 chips.
  561: Actually, I had some other…non-family…related questions.
  562: Looks like I can't afford any information right now. I'll be back when I have
    some chips.
  563: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip, Jules.
  575: "(Jules pockets the chips so quickly, you swear they vanished.) So… which of
    the fine families interests you today?"
  576: "(Jules pockets the chips.) So…which family you got the need to know about?"
  577: Tell me about the Mordino Family.
  578: Tell me about the Salvatore Family.
  579: Tell me about the Bishop Family.
  580: Tell me about the Wright Family.
  581: I had some questions about New Reno…
  582: Actually, nevermind. We'll talk some other time.
  590: "(Holds up two fingers.) The Mordinos are a two-headed beast, friend, an' each
    head's named Jesus Mordino."
  591: Go on…
  592: I always suspected Jesus had ties to organized crime.
  594: Let's go back to the other families.
  596: Actually, nevermind. Thanks for talking with me.
  615: |-
    There's the father, Big Jesus Mordino, and the son, Lil' Jesus, and both are the meanest sons of bitches you ever met.
     Used to be slaves here, but they turned the tables years ago and carved out their own lil' empire.
  616: How big is their "empire?"
  625: |-
    They own the Desperado just down the street. Can't miss it. They also got the biggest supply of Jet in ALL o' New Reno.
     So if you got the urge to fly…
  626: Speaking of which, do you know where can I get some chems around here?
  627: How come the Mordinos have the biggest supply of Jet?
  628: Tell me about the other families.
  635: |-
    They're on top of the pile, friend. Ain't no more reason than that. They got the factory, the maker, and the
     distribution. They're like a whole goddamn airline they got so much Jet.
  636: Yeah, what about it?
  637: What factory?
  638: What "maker?"
  639: How extensive is their distribution network?
  650: |-
    Got factories all over New Reno, cranking out the shit day and night. That's why you can buy all
     the Jet you need most anywhere: bars, casinos, on th' street…and a-course, from ME.
  651: Can I see what you got in stock?
  652: Back to the Mordinos and Jet…
  660: |-
    Yeah… (Leans in.) ...see, the Mordinos got themselves a lil' gold mine by the name o' Myron. Hit the jackpot with him…see,
     he MADE jet.
  662: Enough about the Mordinos and the families for now. Tell me about this Myron…
  670: |-
    They pump it all over New Reno, for starters. Up north to the Den, and also…uh… (Catches himself, then shrugs and continues.)
     ... well, it's also makin' it's way to Redding nowadays, too, which don't hurt the Mordinos purse none.
  672: Tell me about Redding.
  685: |-
    Not much TO say. Mining town northwest o' here. Word is, Mordino wants to get some influence there, get some of
     that Redding GOLD they dig up. So he ships them jet, they ship back gold, everybody happy.
  695: |-
    Quiet bunch. They're led by Louis Salvatore, an original gangster gettin' on in years. Their territory's on the West Side;
     their crib's this bar called Salvatore's on 2nd Street. Don't be making trouble there.
  696: Why not?
  710: |-
    Some free advice: You see a Salvatore, keep your head down n' mouth shut, or they'll cut you in two. They got the best
     firepower this side of Cee-Ay, so nobody with any kinda sense fucks with them, understand?
  711: What kind of "firepower" do the Salvatores have?
  712: Sounds like they got some pretty heavy shit. What are they packing?
  715: Interesting…thanks for the warning.
  725: |-
    Pistols…'cept they shoot LIGHT. Now, Reno's a city o' lights, but the light THOSE pistols shine can cut a man in
     two... *swuppp*... (Jules makes slicing motion.) Makes a clean burn 'tween the two halves, it does.
  726: They shoot light? Do they call the pistols 'laser pistols?'
  727: I'll be sure to be careful, then. Can you tell me about the other families?
  735: |-
    Well, uh, I don't really know… I ain't sure what you're talking about. But take my word for it: don't go asking
     the Salvatores about those pistols. They have this twitchy habit a killing people who're curious.
  736: |-
    By 'laser pistols,' Jules, I mean pistols that emit beams of coherent light. A beam of sufficient wattage - say, several
     megawatts - could do considerable damage if focused on a target for a few seconds, producing the effect you've described.
  737: Did they always have these pistols?
  750: |-
    They didn't always have 'em…else they'd be in charge o' New Reno…ALL of New Reno. As it stands, they're just
     building up quietly. Those pistols showed up…maybe a few months back, 'round the time o' the massacre.
  751: Massacre?
  765: |-
    Oh, yeah…two Salvatore boys with those pistols killed a buncha Bishop's men, then shot down some of Mordino's boys who'd
     been tryin' to muscle in on the West Side. Since then, the other families steered clear of the Salvatores.
  766: |-
    Definitely sounds like lasers. Do you know how the Salvatores power their laser pistols? Do they employ battery packs,
     fusion cells, or cabled power systems of any kind?
  767: Any idea where they're getting these pistols from?
  780: |-
    No idea, friend, I ain't asking, and you shouldn't neither…take my advice. You looking for weapons, there's
     other…safer…places you can try.
  781: Like where?
  782: Tell me some more about the families.
  795: |-
    Uh... now, I  don't know 'bout that, and... hmmmm. Y'know, you talk like one of them whitecoats over at the Stables. Y'sure you ain't
     one of them?
  796: Stables?
  810: |-
    (Leans in.) Now, I don't want to go on 'bout the less PLEASANT New Reno sites, but there's a buncha whitecoats
     who talk like you in this building, the Stables, north o' town. Heavily guarded by Mordino's men.
  811: What do they do there?
  825: |-
    Test new kinds o' Jet, from what I hear. Now, I'm telling you this in CONFIDENCE, friend: don't go poking around
     there…the Mordinos don't like visitors. 'Sides…Jules can get you all the Jet you need.
  826: Why do the Mordinos keep testing Jet? It sounds like it's habit-forming enough
    as it is.
  827: Who do the Mordinos test the chems on?
  828: Do you know how I can get into the Stables?
  840: 'Slaves, pretty much. Keep ''em in stalls in the stables, like brahmin. '
  841: 'Mordinos buy a bunch from slavers that pass through. '
  842: 'Mordinos buy a bunch from slavers like you that pass through New Reno. '
  843: They buy a helluva lot, too, cause the slaves keep getting sick, running away…or
    die. Mostly die.
  860: |-
    Just to make it better, I guess, refine the process, refine the chem. Jet's good, but if they can make it even
     BETTER…difference between scraping the sky and flying to the moon, I s'pose.
  880: |-
    Now hold on a minute -- I wouldn't even THINK about that if I were you, friend. The Mordinos guard that place like
     rabid dogs. Just put the thought outta your mind.
  881: There must be a way in…
  886: All right, nevermind then. Thanks for the information.
  895: |-
    Well... if you can talk all smart like you were doing, you could pass for one of the whitecoats there.
     'Course, you could also hire on with the Mordinos and get put there…
  910: 'Ha! John Bishop? Not much to say: Bishop''s a smart one, tough, and he''s
    looking to get it ALL.'
  911: Yeah, well, he'll have to fight me for it. Where is this jerk-off's territory?
  912: Where's his territory?
  925: |-
    He hangs out at the Shark Club up on 2nd Street. He's surrounded by guards, so don't go paying a visit unless you got REAL
     business with him. (Smiles evily.) And keep yer business away from his wife. AND his daughter.
  926: Uh, business?
  927: No danger of that.
  935: |-
    You know what I mean, brother. Just stay away from them two, 'less the thought of bein' on Bishop's list is somethin'
     you like.
  936: Well, maybe so, but WHAT you got 'tween your legs don't matter... to Missus
    Bishop, at least. She swings like a saloon door.
  937: Uh, tell me some more about the families.
  945: |-
    The Wrights? Heh. The Wrights are the only family who ARE family. The other families, see, they got mercs
     and tumbleweeds for muscle, but the Wright family IS the Wright family, understand?
  946: Got a warning for you where the Wrights are concerned, slaver…see, the Wrights
    are the only family who ARE family.
  947: They're family? How many are there?
  960: Almost twenty or more true-blooded Wrights. Mean as spit and each of them uglier
    than the next.
  961: |-
    Almost twenty or more true-blooded Wrights, and they don't take kindly to people in your line of work. Word is, they
     lost a sister way back when to a slaver, and they ain't liked slavers ever since.
  962: What do the Wrights control in New Reno?
  975: |-
    They ain't got no casino, they mostly deal in alcohol and sell it to the other families. So if you're looking
     for hootch…they hang out in the east side o' town in a big mansion.
  985: 'Brother, you need look no farther than humble Jules himself. '
  986: 'Sister, you need look no farther than humble Jules himself. '
  987: 'My sweet sister, you need look no farther than humble Jules himself. '
  988: I got it ALL, and if I ain't got it, you don't want it. Shall we get down to
    bizness?
  989: Sure. Let's deal.
  990: What kind of chems can I get in New Reno?
  991: Not right now. I had some other questions…
  992: Actually, I'm not interested in any chems right now. I have to be going.
  1005: |-
    All KINDS o' shit. I got shit make you horny, make your woman horny, make you hard, make you happy, make you strong,
     make you smart…and, o course, I got THE chem, the shit that'll let you FLY…Jet.
  1006: |-
    All KINDS o' shit. I got shit make you horny, make you wet, dry you out, calm you down, sex you up, make you happy,
     make you strong, make you smart…and, o course, I got THE shit that'll let you FLY…Jet.
  1008: Where does Jet come from? Has it always been around?
  1025: |-
    Well... uh... Jet comes from here…Reno, I mean. It ain't been around long, but it's in DEMAND, know what I'm saying? (Winks.)
     Number one reason we get tourists like yourself.
  1026: Well, I'm looking to buy some chems. Let's deal.
  1027: But why did Jet come from here?
  1035: |-
    Aw, now…see, Family Mordino struck the jackpot one day when they found this little brainiac called Myron. Seems he's a
     natural when it comes to making chems. He MADE Jet.
  1036: Myron, huh? Where can I find him?
  1045: |-
    (Leans in.) Now, I don't want to go on 'bout the less PLEASANT New Reno sites, but there's this building, the Stables,
     north o' town. Heavily guarded by the Mordino family. That's where Myron is.
  1046: Stables outside of town?
  1055: |-
    Yeah, Mordinos keep ol' golden boy there, give him chips, whores, anything he wants, as long as he makes chems. Jet
     was his FINEST. Ain't seen anything so habit-forming in a long time. Turned Reno around, it did.
  1056: Think I could meet this Myron?
  1065: "(Jules stops and studies you, his eyes running up and down your body.)"
  1066: Jules? Hello? I asked if there was any way I could meet Myron.
  1075: |-
    Whoa, now, brother, here's some free advice: don't you go be looking to meet Myron, 'cause the Mordinos catch wind of THAT, they'll gut you and let
     you die on Golgotha.
  1076: |-
    I wouldn't be trying it. If you need Jet, don't go see Myron, cause you can get it from me. Mordinos catch wind of you
     seeing Myron, they'll gut you and let you die on Golgotha.
  1077: |-
    Well, now…YOU might be able to see him. Thing is, the Mordinos catch wind of it, they'll gut you and let you die on
     Golgotha.
  1078: Isn't there any way I could see him?
  1079: Why would I be able to see him?
  1080: Why were you studying me like a sculpture a second ago?
  1081: Golgotha? What's that?
  1083: Interesting. Thanks for the information.
  1101: Isn't there any way I could see Myron?
  1102: Why would I be able to see Myron?
  1103: Why were you studying me like a sculpture a second ago?
  1115: "I was doing THAT cause I was seein' if you were Myron's type, but you don't
    look it. Maybe if you cleaned yourself up\n some, Myron'd give you a second glance…see,
    he likes the womenses. "
  1116: "(Leers.) Cause, honey, you look GOOD. And Myron likes women that look GOOD. "
  1117: Boy's like a rabbit, and is ALWAYS looking for a new cabbage patch.
  1118: What was that about Golgotha?
  1119: Uh, great. Thanks for the tip, Jules. Say, I had some other questions…
  1120: Well, on that note, I think I better be going.
  1121: How eloquent. When you speak, it's poetry - the use of "cabbage patch" brings
    forth striking imagery. THANK you.
  1130: |-
    If you were a fine-looking woman, maybe, but otherwise, you would need the Mordinos' permission first. Both ain't
     very likely.
  1132: I see. Say, I had some other questions…
  1145: |-
    You want weapons, you go see my man Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll kill people you ain't even MET yet.
     Tell him I sent you.
  1146: |-
    I hear you, brother, I hear you. You want the best, you go see my man Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll kill
     people you ain't even MET yet. Tell him I sent you.
  1147: |-
    I hear you, sister, I hear you. You want the best, you go see my man Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll
     kill people you ain't even MET yet. Tell him I sent you.
  1148: |-
    Sweetness, you ALREADY packing some serious shit with that body of yours. Still, if you want more, go see my man
     Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll kill people you ain't even MET yet. Tell him I sent you.
  1150: Thanks for the tip, I think I better be going.
  1165: |-
    You need some supplies? Well, you CAN go see Renesco up on the West End…but here's the catch: don't buy no chems
     from him, cause they ain't SAFE. He's got supplies all right, but if you want chems, talk to me.
  1166: I'll keep that in mind. Say, I had some more questions…
  1167: His chems aren't safe, huh? Well, thanks for the tip, I think I better be
    going.
  1175: |-
    I hear you, brother. Most TOURISTS, see, they stride down Virgin street and get suckered by some two-chip whore.
     You look like you got class, so head over to the Cat's Paw 'cross the street there. Tell 'em Jules sent you.
  1176: |-
    I hear you, sister. Most TOURISTS, see, they stride down Virgin street and get suckered by some glitterboy.
     You look like you got class, so head over to the Cat's Paw 'cross the street there. Tell 'em Jules sent you.
  1177: "(Smiles, holds out arms.) Look no farther, my sweet sister. Jules is at your
    command!"
  1178: Uh, thanks, Jules, but no. Say, I had some more questions…
  1180: Well, thanks for the tip. I think I better be going.
  1181: Well, uh, thanks anyway, but I think I better be going.
  1190: You mean Vault CITY, don't you? That's to the northeast. Can't miss it, all
    the caravan trails lead right to it.
  1191: All right. Say, I had some more questions…
  1192: Well, thanks for the tip. I better be going.
  1200: Garden of wha-? That some kind of chem? What does this "Garden thing" do?
    Get you high?
  1201: No, it's…well, nevermind. I had some other questions…
  1202: Nevermind. I really better be going.
  1210: Don't know nothing about that. Sorry about your loss. Maybe it was slavers?
  1211: Could be. I had some other questions…
  1220: A what?
  1221: Forget it. I had some other questions…
  1230: |-
    Uh... Wright kid? Yeah, I heard about that. A damn shame. Kids his age shouldn't be doing chems. They got so much
     to live for without being given impure shit.
  1231: Speaking of impure shit, Renesco said you sell Jet laced with arsenic.
  1232: What do you mean, "impure shit?"
  1233: You know anything about this empty Jet canister?
  1234: Interesting you should say that... I don't think he overdosed on Jet. I think
    he was poisoned.
  1250: |-
    (Shrugs.) Some dealers don't care what they sell, and people die. Now I ain't saying nothing, but I'd check with ol'
     Renesco the Rocketman and see how good his shit is.
  1251: I did check with Renesco... he said you sell Jet laced with arsenic.
  1252: Reno's a big place, Jules. Anybody else who might be responsible?
  1253: I had some other questions…
  1254: All right. I'll check him out.
  1270: |-
    Lotta dealers in town…Lil' Jesus Mordino, maybe, but why he would sell to a Wright don't make sense. There's Jagged
     Jimmy J up on 2nd Street, north of here, but he's small time. I'd still check with Renesco, though.
  1272: '"Jagged Jimmy J?" Who''s that?'
  1273: Lil' Jesus Mordino? Where can I find him?
  1274: Maybe I will. Say, I had some other questions…
  1275: Lil' Jesus…Jagged Jimmy J…Renesco. Got it. Thanks.
  1290: |-
    (Jules' smile dies.) I'm lookin' for people like you comin' into Reno. This is the prime spot to deal. Plus, certain
     establishments pay me to point newcomers their way. THAT a good enough answer for you?
  1291: Yes. Now I need the answer to some other questions…
  1292: Just curious. Thanks for the honesty.
  1305: Your CAR? You sure you parked it here? I ain't seen it.
  1306: |-
    What, you suddenly gone BLIND? You see my FIST, mother fucker? You SEE it?!! Now tell me again you haven't seen my
     car…I fucking DARE you.
  1307: |-
    Jules, if you don't tell me what happened to my car, I'll tell Family Wright YOU sold their son the Jet that
     killed him. You'll be dead within the hour. Talk.
  1308: You SURE you haven't seen it, Jules?
  1309: Yes, I'm SURE I parked it here. Any idea where it might be?
  1310: All right then. I had some other questions…
  1311: I better go look for it.
  1320: 'Naw, brother, I ain''t seen it. '
  1321: 'Naw, sister, I ain''t seen it. '
  1322: I'll keep an eye out for it, though. (Shrugs.) Still, Reno's a big place…
  1323: |-
    Jules, I have this crazy HUNCH you know where my car went. If you don't tell me where it is, I'll use you for
     target practice. Now talk.
  1324: Thanks anyway. I had some other questions…
  1340: 'Sister, I don''t know NOTHING about your car. '
  1341: 'Brother, I don''t know NOTHING about your car. '
  1342: 'I AIN''T seen what happened to it, and I DON''T know where it is. '
  1343: "(He throws a hateful glance at Cody across the street.)"
  1344: Really? That sounds like a load of SHIT to me.
  1345: That so? I KNOW you did something with it, so you better tell me where it
    is before I do something to YOU.
  1346: Nevermind then. I'll keep looking for it.
  1360: 'All right, brother, all right! '
  1361: 'All right, sister, all right! '
  1362: "…I seen some guys take the car not long ago. But there were too many of them
    for me to stop, y'know, and --"
  1363: Shut up and take me where they went. Now.
  1364: Nevermind. I'll look for them without your help.
  1375: Okay, okay…
  1376: |-
    By the way…Jules? If you so much as GLANCE the wrong way at that kid across the street, I'll come back and kill
     you so many times you'll need multiple wills. Understand? Now lead on.
  1377: |-
    One more thing, Jules: I even so much as hear that you were messing with Cody, I'll kill you. Now take me to
     where my car is.
  1378: "(Follow him.)"
  1385: H…hey. (Smiles uneasily. His cologne slams into you like a wave.) Name's Jules.
    What you need, my friend, huh? A..anything?
  1386: |-
    H…hey. Hey, welcome back! (Smiles uneasily. His cologne slams into you like a wave.) What you need from Jules, my
     friend, huh? A..anything?
  1389: I had some questions…
  1390: Nice cologne, Jules. I smelled it all over Cody's body. You're dead.
  1391: Cody's dead, Jules. I'm betting you were responsible. You're dead.
  1405: H-hey, I WISH I could help, but I don't know nothin'…look, I gotta go.
  1406: Nice cologne, Jules. I smelled it all over Cody's body. You're fucking dead.
  1407: Cody's dead, Jules. I'm betting you were responsible. You're fucking dead.
  1408: See you, Jules.
  1415: |-
    He's this dumb sonuvabitch who thinks he's a big-time dealer. You can't miss him...his face is all scarred up.
     The fool was flying on Jet one night and tried to shave with a combat knife. Sad part is, it didn't KILL 'im.
  1416: And Lil' Jesus Mordino? Where can I find him?
  1417: Lotta love in this town...say, I had some other questions…
  1425: |-
    Well, friend, I'd be careful about just walkin' in and accusing Lil' Jesus of anything. But if you REALLY want to
     talk with him, I ain't gonna stop you. He hangs out at the Desperado 'cross the street there.
  1426: And "Jagged Jimmy J?" Who's that?
  1427: Say, I had some other questions…
  1435: Doesn't surprise me...that sort of thing seems to happen a LOT in this town.
  1436: What do you mean by that?
  1437: What can you tell me about this empty Jet canister?
  1439: I see. Well, thanks for your time.
  1450: "(Glances at it.) Like a hundred others I've seen. It ain't mine, though...could
    be Jagged Jimmy J's or Renesco's."
  1451: Jagged Jimmy J?
  1452: Renesco?
  1453: Hmmm. I had some other questions…
  1470: |-
    He's this dumb sonuvabitch up on 2nd Street, north of here. You can't miss him...his face is all scarred up. The
     fool was flying on Jet one night and tried to shave with a combat knife. Sad part is, it didn't KILL 'im.
  1471: And Renesco? Where can I find him?
  1473: Got it. Thanks.
  1485: |-
    He's this old cracker who runs a pharmacy on Commercial Row...go up a few streets north, make a left where Salvatore's
     and the Bishop casino meet, then keep heading down that street. It's on the right.
  1486: And "Jagged Jimmy J?" Where can I find him?
  1487: All right...say, I had some other questions…
  1500: |-
    You tell that bitch he keeps talking shit like that, an' I'LL kill 'im before old man Wright does. You know what kind
     of talk that is? That's talk from a man who's SCARED, that's what it is.
  1501: I see...say, I had some other questions…
  1502: I hear you. I'll go check it out.

  273: Uh…thanks for saving us. You, uh, got some extra chips to spare?
  274: I saved the world once, too. I think. Maybe I was high.
  275: Did the Enclave have any Jet?
  276: Are you the one who caused that big boom down south? It made my head hurt.

  262: Hey, Keith. I ran into your Mom.
  263: Can you tell me about your brother Richard?
  264: Nevermind. Sorry to bother you.

    here?
  312: Chris told me to stop by. I'm looking for work. Can you help me?
  313: Keith Wright, huh? I ran into your mother.
  315: What is this place?
  325: This is the Family Wright HOUSE. Now, you gonna tell me what yer doing here?
  335: Chris sent you, huh?
  336: That's right. He said you might have some work for me.
  345: I don't know if it'd do any good, but I guess I could ask Pa…
  346: If you could, I'd appreciate it.
  355: 'Naw...we don''t hire muscle like the other families, ''least not now. '
  356: 'Naw...we don''t traffic with slaver trash like the other families. '

  381: No. Is that a common occurrence?
  383: No, I was just curious. Later, Keith.
  390: |-
    Sometimes. She's always preachin' and hollerin' about the evils o' drink and gamblin' and damn
     near everything else. Causes quite a stir, sometimes, and gets Dad real upset.
  391: Does your Mom have any idea what your family does?
  392: I'll bet. Well, thanks for talking with me, Keith.
  400: |-
    Naw, she don't know half of it. She thinks Dad's all clean and above the board, but she ain't too
     bright to catch on to what he's doin'. If she found that still beneath the train station, she'd raise cain, she would.
  401: I see. Thanks, Keith.
  410: |-
    (Shakes head.) She done it this time, wrecking Pa's stills n' all. The workers were too afraid
     ta stop her, and Pa threw a fit, and she threw one right back at him. (Shrugs.) It'll take Pa a while to
     get back up on his feet.
  420: Good kid. Damn, if we ever find out who done it to him…
  421: Any ideas who might've done it?
  422: Well, hopefully you'll find the killer. Bye, Keith.

    Quiet kid, clean kid. Kept outta trouble, and for a Wright, that's something. We buried
     him on the Golgotha plains a while ago, but even so, Mom still don't want his room disturbed.
     It's hard for her to let go, y'know?
  451: Which room was his? Do you think your mother would mind if I looked in there?
  452: Any dealers you suspect may have given him the Jet?
  454: Buried in Golgotha, huh? Hmmm. Thanks for the info, Keith.
  460: |-
    His room? It's the empty one next to Mom's room, the second one down from the kitchen. As fer looking around… well… look, don't stay
     long… and don't mess the place up, or Mom'll pop a clip if she finds out.
  461: Thanks, Keith. I won't be long.
  470: |-
    Hold on. (Knocks on door behind him.) Pa? (He sticks his head in, there's some mumbling, then he comes back and nods at the door.)
     You ken go in, but watch out. Dad's in a pissy mood.
  471: Thanks.

    He's Big Jesus's son. A bastard, more like. He mighta caught Richard alone, then pumped him fulla
     Jet outta spite. You looking for him, check out the Desperado. Little Jesus hangs out there with his old man.

    and businesslike.
  200: First quarter revenues are up slightly…now, if we account for the increased
    tribute…
  201: If I catch her taking Jet, even a *whiff,* she's out of here…
  202: Monthly physicals are coming around again…right in time for the new caravan
    season.
  203: Need to get some more girls for that pool party at Bishop's…

  205: Spend so much time updating these spreadsheets, I don't get any REAL work done.

    You know, I've been finding magazines named "Cat's Paw" throughout the desert, and I have no

  246: |-
    Well, pardon me for coming on strong, but I'd like to get to know YOU better. What time do you get off?
     Uh, work, I mean.
  247: Depends…what's on the menu?
  248: I'd like to hook up my friend here with a little something special.
  249: I'd like to hook up one of my friends here. It's their…uh, birthday.
  250: I'd like to ask you some questions…
  251: Actually, I've changed my mind. Performance anxiety and all. Goodbye.
  255: I'm flattered, but…no. I can't.
  256: Aw, c'mon. Just a drink. No pressure. We'll have a great time.
  257: |-
    Look, if you don't like women, that's fine. Hell, I don't like most women I meet. We have something in

  260: Sorry, didn't mean to pressure you. Goodbye.

  267: It's a date. See you then.

    Well…(Ticks off the menu on her fingers.)…we have honey loving, the dipstick swirl, humjobs, and various
     other exotica. (Smiles.) Question is, what are YOU in the mood for?
  276: I'd like some…oral attention.
  277: Just some basic, raunchy, low-down, dirty sex oughta do me just fine.
  278: I'd like a full upper and lower body workout.
  279: Is it okay if I just, you know, talk with them?
  280: I have a special…dramatic…request.
  290: 'All right then. '
  291: "(Winks.) That'll be no charge."
  292: 'That''ll be '
  293: Done. Here's the money.
  294: Can't argue about that price. Let's do it.
  295: Nevermind. I'd like to ask you some questions…
  296: I don't have enough money…maybe another time.
  320: 'Why, of course you can. We call it the "Kesting special." '
  322: 'Only costs '
  323: Why do you call it that?
  325: Sounds like a deal. I'll take that then.
  326: Maybe some other time. I'd like to ask you some questions…
  335: "Well…rumor has it there was once an employee of a famous computer company
    who enjoyed talking with\n others. (Shrugs.) "
  336: 'By coincidence, he also only made '
  1336: " chips a week."

  353: Sure. What questions did you have?
  354: I heard some of your girls are chosen to go…visit Myron.
  355: Jules told me to come here for some…action.

    I'd like my partner to dress up in a Vault jumpsuit, call me the "Vault Dweller," and I've got to find
     their "Vault Sex-Teen."

    a dip in her mutating "vat."
  378: |-
    I'd like to play the role of "Herk," a nubile young slave stolen from his village by a band of lusty

  384: Actually, Nevermind. I've got to go.
  395: Of course. (Scans your companions.) Which one?
  396: Could you take care of Lenny? I don't think he's ever even kissed a girl.

  400: Cassidy here. I think it's been a while.
  401: Vic. "Trader" Vic.
  402: Can one of your girls read the dictionary to Robo Brain? It stimulates his
    brain center.
  403: Doc's looking to take a "temperature" or two.
  404: Davin here could use…a lot…more experience.

    (Looks surprised.) Let me see. (Glances at magazine.) Well, well…you know, I had heard a rumor that
     - in the pre-war years -- the Cat's Paw was a publishing house…for pornographic materials.
  441: For pornogru - porn-o-gra - pornu - uh, a publishing house, you said?
  442: This place was a publishing house?
  450: |-
    Yes…the rooms here were used for film shoots with models from across the world. (Seems entranced by the magazine.)
     Quite a little piece of history you have there.
  451: Well, you know, I just read this for the articles.
  452: |-
    I'm just glad to know what the damn thing is. It's irritating to keep examining it and getting
     that same message over and over. I'll probably STILL get it even though it's identified now.
  460: |-
    You know…if you can bring me a complete set…say, ten issues, I'll buy them from you. They'd be good for
     a display, might attract customers. Are you interested?
  461: If I can FIND that many...say, I had some other questions…
  462: Actually, I happen to have ten right here.
  463: Sure. If I come across that many, I'll be sure to stop by.
  470: Wonderful! I'll give you $500 for the set.
  471: "$500? After collecting ALL of these? No way. Make it a thousand."
  472: Sounds good. Here you go. But hey, careful with number five…the pages look
    like they are glued together.
  473: No, I think I'll keep them...say, I had some other questions…
  474: No thanks, I've become attached to them. Maybe some other time.
  480: Hmmmmm. Seven fifty, and you got a deal.
  481: "$750? All right, then. They're yours."
  482: I think I'll keep them then...say, I had some other questions…
  483: Forget it. Maybe some other time.
  490: Here you go. (Counts out the money, hands it to you.) Thanks again.
  491: Say, I had some other questions…
  492: Not a problem. Goodbye.
  500: |-
    Really? (Examines No. 5, then goes through the rest of your stack.) Hmmmm. Well, it looks like you have
     two of them, so you can have this one back…but let me get the stain out first.
  501: Okay. Uh…by the way, that stain isn't mine. I have no idea how it got there.
  502: Okay. Are you sure you can get that stain out? It looks glued in there pretty
    tight.
  510: |-
    Happens all the time around here…(Miss Kitty starts cleaning the magazine.)…mostly to the sheets. That
     should do it...(Holds it up.)...good issue - has an article on energy weapons, it looks like. Here you go.

  512: An article on energy weapons? Thanks. I might read it later on.

    (As you speak, she looks up, startled.) You! You came back! I…I thought you might be dead. (She looks
     relieved.) I was so *worried.* Risking your life, taking on the Enclave…that's the bravest thing I've ever heard.
  521: |-
    (As you speak, she looks up, startled.) You! I've heard about you. (Her face beams with admiration.) Risking
     your life, taking on the Enclave…that's the bravest thing I've ever heard.

    ! I'm glad you've come back again. Just having a hero like yourself around does wonders for business:

  524: |-
    Daaaaamn right, baby. And that's the bravest thing you're ever gonna hear, cause I'm the BADDEST of

    have done.

    welcome here, free of charge.

  553: I expect nothing less. I'll collect later.
  565: 'All right then, '
  566: "…let me just get my coat."
  567: No rush. Take your time.
  568: Good thing I've got my "coat" in my pocket. Heh-heh.

    (Nods.) Yes, that's correct. We usually have to train them extensively to suppress their natural
     revulsion. It's almost a rite of passage now. Still, if a girl can abide Myron, it means she's tough…
  586: I'd like to meet him. Think I could volunteer to be his next "choice?"
  587: I see. I had some other questions…
  588: Hmmmm. Thanks for the information.
  595: "(Studies you, then makes a circling gesture with her finger.) Turn around
    for me. Hmmmm… "
  596: |-
    no, I don't think you'd make the cut. Maybe if you cleaned yourself up a little more, made
     yourself…presentable. Sorry.
  597: |-
    yes… yes, I think you'd do just fine. Are you interested in the job? All of my other girls
     are…sick of it.
  598: Sure.
  599: Hmmmph. I had some other questions…
  600: No, but I may ask again later. I had some other questions…
  610: |-
    (Nods.) Excellent. One of the Mordino lieutenants should be showing up soon. If you want to take a
     seat, I'll present you as one of the…applicants.
  611: All right…I'll wait for him.
  612: Actually, forget it. I had some other questions…
  613: Nevermind…I've changed my mind. Maybe some other time.

  621: "(Looks your companion up and down, then nods.) I think we can accommodate
    your friend… "

  701: Shag-a-riffic.
  702: Wow. That was deep.
  703: Wow.
  704: "*Whew*"
  705: I sure hope I didn't get her pregnant.
  710: You talk for hours. The girls at the Cat's Paw have amazing insight into human
    nature.

    The Mordino lieutenant arrives, and seems impressed with you. He leads you north out of
     town to someplace called the "Stables."

  548: Thanks for the compliment. I was just stopping by; I have to be going.
  549: Yeah, I don't need you to tell me that. Just watch yourself.
  560: 'Heeeey! How''s it going, '

  563: You being helped, or do I got to call over one of the waitresses ta get you

  567: No, I'm fine. Say, I had some questions for you, Jesus…
  568: No, I'm good, thanks. Catch you later.
  582: Eh? You looking to deal, slaver? Got some stock you wanna unload?
  583: Me unload! Me unload!
  586: Sure. Are you the one to talk to?
  587: Not right now. I had some questions for you, though…
  588: Not right now. Maybe later.
  600: Heh. You been out squatting in the sun too long. Get.
  601: Eh…right. You take care, amigo. I'll catch you later.
  602: Eh…right. You take care, chica. I'll catch you later.
  603: Heh. Maybe you oughta go back out and squat in the sun, tribal. Clear the air

  604: Okeee Doh-kee
  620: Get outta here.
  621: Come around here again, and I'll fill you so full o' lead even Superman couldn't

  622: "::Plays with knife threateningly::"

  626: Come around here again, and I'll gut you.
  640: "(Picks fingernails with knife.) Questions…EVERYBODY got questions…"
  641: "(Picks his teeth with a dirty fingernail.) Yeah?"
  642: Something on your mind?
  643: What was that you were saying about the Mordino Family again?
  1643: Who is this Mordino Family you were talking about?
  644: I'm looking for a job.
  645: What is there to do around New Reno to relax?
  646: You know anything about Richard Wright overdosing on Jet?
  647: Can you teach me knife fighting?
  648: Nevermind. Catch you later.
  660: |-
    Me? If you gotta ask…heh. Name's Jesus. Jesus Mordino. Same as my Dad, he's the BIG Jesus, head of WHOLE Mordino family
     here in Reno. So most call me Lil' Jesus. Prevents confusion, y'know?
  661: Family Mordino? Who are they?
  662: I've heard about your family. I hear you guys are a force to be reckoned with.
  663: I'm looking for a job. Is Family Mordino hiring?
  665: Know what there is to do around New Reno to relax?
  666: I see. Say, I had some questions…
  680: We Mordinos are gonna run New Reno…and Redding, too. You'll see.
  681: Family MORDINO? You been taking too much Jet, homes? We Mordinos run New Reno…and
    Redding, too.
  682: Family MORDINO? You been taking too much Jet, chica? We Mordinos run New Reno…and
    Redding, too.
  683: Sounds like the Mordino family is the one to hook up with…can you set me up?
  684: What do you mean about Redding?
  685: Redding? Where's that?
  686: Sounds like the Mordinos have a bright future. Say, I had some questions…
  687: You Mordinos talk big, but got small cojones. What you got to say about that,
    LITTLE Jesus?
  700: 'To the northwest, homes. '
  701: 'To the northwest, chica. '
  702: If you ain't been there, you ain't missing nothing. Bunch of no-neck miners
    who like to FLY, know what I'm saying?
  703: Not really. What do you mean?
  704: They're a bunch of chem reliants?
  705: I hear you. I had some other questions…
  706: I have to go. Later, Jesus.
  720: Bunch of no-neck miners, dig in the dirt, but they like to FLY, know what I'm
    saying?
  740: |-
    Them no-necks dig for gold, see, but what WE give them is better than gold, know what I'm saying? They give us ALL
     the gold they dig up just for a LEETLE Jet. Everybody happy.
  742: Sounds like it. Look, I had some other questions…
  760: Well, when they got their first taste o' Jet, they were. You can't have just
    one.
  761: Where does the Jet come from?
  762: I hear you. Look, I had some other questions…
  780: |-
    The Jet? It comes from HERE. See, we don't dig for gold, we MAKE it: liquid gold. Jet. Worth a fortune to the miners, costs
     next to nothing to make. We ship it to Redding, they shoot up, they fly, they ship us gold. That simple.
  781: |-
    How long has this been going on? It seems like you would have controlled all of Northern California by now if Jet was that
     habit-forming.
  800: |-
    You're right about that…see, we didn't always HAVE Jet. But we stumbled across this kid - he took a look at the shitty
     chems we was selling and said he could do 'better.' And he did. Now he works for us. That simple.
  801: Who is this kid and where is he?
  820: Kid's name's Myron. As for where he IS, that's somethin' you don't need to
    know.
  821: |-
    Kid's name's Myron. We got him set up in the stables, north of town, testing new chems. You could go over and see him if
     you want, but he's busy most of the time…either with the chems or the women.
  822: Why don't you get smart and tell me anyway?
  823: Got it. I had some other questions…
  824: Myron, huh? All right then, Jesus. Thanks for the conversation.
  840: |-
    The Desperado is the place to be, homes. We got the Jet, the games, the action…and we got all the putas you need
     right outside, wet and willing. Paradise, homes. Pair-a-dice.
  841: |-
    The Desperado is the place to be, chica. We got the Jet, the games, and the action. You
     ain't need to go nowhere else.
  842: So…you wanna re-lax, chica? Heh...then how 'bout you and me get down to some
    sweet love?
  843: Tempting, but I haven't got ten seconds for your sweet love right now, Little
    Jesus.
  844: I'm flattered, but no thanks. Say, I had some other questions…
  846: I'm looking for a job. Know of any place that's hiring?
  847: Thanks for the tip, thanks.
  848: Why don't you start without me? I have to go.
  860: |-
    Eh? What are you talkin ab --? (Gets it.) You fucking PUTA! You better get yo tramp ass outta here 'fore I carve you
     into so many pieces your own mother won't recognize you.
  861: |-
    Eh? What are you talkin ab --? (Gets it.) You better get your ass out here, homes, 'fore I take my knife and give
     you a second smile on that neck of yours.
  862: Try it and see what happens, LITTLE Jesus.
  863: Try it, and I'll add so many scars to your face you'll look like a jigsaw puzzle.
  864: Calm down…I was just kidding with you.
  865: Chill. I had some other questions…
  867: I'm leaving. Great talking to someone as cultured as you.
  880: |-
    Ha! You all right, chica. You all right. Lil' Jesus gonna be keeping an eye on you…not that I couldn't help myself. What
     can I do for you?
  881: |-
    First thing you can do for me is keep your eyes to yourself, LITTLE Jesus. I'd sooner consider humping a rock before
     touching that cratered landscape you call a face.
  882: I'm looking for a job. Know of anyone who's hiring?
  883: I had some other questions…
  884: Actually, I have to be going. Good talking to you, Jesus.
  890: "(Checks you over, nods.) We're always looking for new blood…'specially new
    blood that's willing to spill blood, know what I'm saying? Go upstairs, talk to
    my Pa, tell him I sent you, and maybe we can do business."
  891: |-
    (Checks you over, shakes head.) We don't hire chicas…'cept in certain positions. Try Pa upstairs, tell him I sent you.
     Maybe you can do some business.
  892: Maybe so. Say, I had some other questions…
  893: I'll go see him then. Later, Jesus.
  900: I don't know. You don't look too strong to me…maybe you should try somewhere
    else, homes.
  901: |-
    Naw...my mind's a blank. Our family ain't hiring, and the other families sooner'd kill you than listen to you. You
     outta luck, homes.
  902: |-
    Naw...I don't know of no place hiring. You might try and find a pimp, MAYBE earn some cash charging rent on yer
     ass, y'know?
  903: |-
    WE ain't hiring, but with a bod like that, you might try the Corsican Bros Studio up the street. (Grins.) But if you're looking
     for some quick chips, my room's upstairs...
  904: All right then. I had some other questions…
  905: Uh, I'll pass. I had some other questions…
  906: I'd rather not, thanks. I had some other questions for you, though…
  907: Oh, I bet it WOULD be quick. No thanks.
  908: Nevermind then. Thanks anyway.
  909: No thanks. I better be going.
  920: Oh, so that makes it all better then, huh? (Spits at your feet.) Get the hell
    outta here 'fore I carve you.
  921: Just try it and see what happens…LITTLE Jesus.
  922: Calm down, Jesus…look, I had a few other questions…
  923: I'm leaving.
  924: You spit on my shoe? You fuck! I'm gonna teach you a lesson about respect,
    mother fucker.
  930: No, not me…head on upstairs and see my Pa. He's the one you want to talk to.
  931: And you are...?
  932: All right then. Before I go, I had some questions…
  933: Thanks.
  940: FUCK you. Get outta my family's casino 'fore I carve my initials on your dead
    body.
  942: Don't you threaten me, Jesus.
  943: Hold on - I had some other questions…
  944: Calm down, Jesus. I'm leaving.
  950: |-
    That little piss-ass Wright kid? Ha! You trying to pin that shit on me? You outta luck; I ain't sorry the little
     fucker's dead, but I didn't have NOTHIN' to do with it.
  951: |-
    Oh, yeah? Well, the Mordinos are the biggest suppliers of Jet in New Reno. That makes you the first ones who are
     gonna take the blame.
  952: I don't believe you. I think you ARE the one responsible. You and the rest
    of the Mordinos.
  953: Who do you figure might have done it?
  954: Okay…look, I had some other questions…
  955: All right then. Just asking.
  965: |-
    (Eyes narrow.) Look now, I ain't had NOTHING to do with that kid's death. I don't know what you heard, but if I'd killed
     that kid, I woulda carved him up, not made him crash and burn on Jet, see?
  966: |-
    Yeah, so what if we take the blame? Don't mean we DID it. Little shit took too much. I ain't sorry he's dead. And
     if ol' man Wright starts throwing down, we'll bury him right next to his junkie kid.
  967: You're a real humanitarian, Jesus.
  968: That's a GREAT attitude, Jesus.
  969: You know who sold Richard the Jet that killed him?
  970: Well, that certainly clears matters up for me. I had some other questions…
  971: Thanks for the information, Jesus. You've been very helpful.
  980: |-
    Yeah, Renesco…the "Rocketman." Sells so much Jet, he could shoot you to the moon. He's on the west side, in Salvatore
     territory. He don't like the Wrights none, and his chems ain't PURE, know what I'm saying?
  981: He can't be the only dealer in a town this size.
  982: West side, huh? I might stop by. I had some other questions, though…
  983: All right. I'll check it out. Thanks, Jesus.
  990: No, there's others, but Renesco's the one who done it.
  991: What makes you say that?
  992: Who are the other dealers?
  993: Yeah, you said that already. Look, I had some other questions…
  994: All right, Jesus. Thanks for the info.
  1000: |-
    CAUSE he's a half-blind cracker with a mean streak a mile wide that sells BAD SHIT, that's fucking why. You go see him,
     you see what he says about the Wright kid, and THEN you'll see I'm right.
  1001: What other dealers are there?
  1002: I may do that. Look, I had some other questions…
  1003: All right then, Jesus. I'll go check this Renesco out.
  1010: |-
    There's Jules, front of town, peddles mostly to newcomers…n' Jagged Jimmy J, up on 2nd street by the gym…can't
     miss that punk-ass cause he cut his face up one night while on Jet…it's so bad his entire face is all scars.
  1011: I hear you deal chems, too, Jesus. How come YOUR name wasn't on that list?
  1012: What makes you think Renesco's responsible?
  1013: Interesting. I had some other questions…
  1014: Renesco, Jules and Jagged Jimmy J. Got it. Thanks for the information.
  1020: 'CAUSE, mother fucker, I AIN''T a dealer. '
  1021: 'CAUSE I AIN''T a dealer, BITCH. '
  1022: |-
    I may sell Jet sometimes, but I'm Lil' Jesus MORDINO, not some two-bit Jet-pushing punk that's got to work ten
     customers a day just to make enough to eat. So FUCK you.
  1023: You better watch your mouth with me, Jesus.
  1024: Easy, easy, just curious…look, I had some other questions…
  1025: All right then. Thanks for the information.
  1030: "(Lil' Jesus glances at the knife in your hand, shakes his head.) "
  1031: "(The man glances at the knife in your hand, shakes his head.) "
  1032: "*Tchhhh.* Don't you know how to HOLD a knife, homes? "

  1036: Kagagoogoo
  1038: Really? Can you teach me?
  1040: Actually, I had some questions for you, Jesus…
  1041: Maybe some other time, thanks.
  1050: Hmmmmm...
  1051: I don't know, homes…I mean, I ain't got a lot of free time and knife fighting's
    an ART, y'know?
  1052: I don't know, chica…I mean, I ain't got a lot of free time and knife fighting's
    an ART, y'know?
  1053: |-
    I don't know, chica…I mean, I MIGHT be willing to make an exception for a woman such as yourself, but I ain't
     got a lot of free time…and knife fighting's an ART, y'know?
  1054: I'll give you a hundred chips.
  1055: I'll give you two hundred chips.
  1056: My lovemaking's an art, too. Wanna swap styles?
  1058: Actually, I had some questions…
  1059: Some other time then…when I have enough chips to change your mind.
  1060: Maybe some other time then, thanks.
  1070: Hmmmmm. 200 and it's a deal.
  1071: Naw...I was thinking about something ELSE, y'know? (His eyes drift down your
    body, licks his chapped lips.)
  1072: Tell me you mean 200 chips. PLEASE tell me you mean 200 chips.
  1073: Oh, you were thinking of sex? Well, keep thinking, cause it ain't gonna happen.
  1074: Uh, okay. Let's do it. Anything for some added knife skill.
  1075: All right. Here's the money.
  1076: Nevermind. Uh, who are you, anyway?
  1077: Forget it. I had some other questions…
  1079: Maybe some other time, thanks. I REALLY have to be going.
  1090: |-
    Hmmmm...all right, yeah, I'll do it. You look like you might have the cojones for it. Look, now, the first thing you
     gotta do is…
  1091: |-
    Hmmmm...all right, yeah, I'll do it. You look like you might have the cojones for it…no offense. Look, now, the first
     thing you gotta do is…
  1092: |-
    (Smiles, displaying the rotted remains of his teeth.) All right, yeah, I'll do it. You got some time right NOW, chica?
     Then let's get down to business…
  1093: All right...
  2000: Lil' Jesus shows you some vicious knife fighting tricks. You have become more
    skilled with knives.

    Face sign, go northwest three graves, go northeast until the first stake, then look for
     "Arch Stanton"…all right, let's go, Lloyd. I need someone to dig, after all.
  367: All right then. I'm outta here. Make yourself scarce. (Let Lloyd leave.)
  368: That's all I needed to know…they'll be burying you at that grave in the morning.
  375: |-
    (Lloyd looks like he's about to say something, thinks better of it, then nods.) All right
     then. Seems I got no choice. Let's go.
  376: |-
    I have some stuff to take care of first. You wait here, I'll be back in a hour. (Leave, hide
     outside room, then see if Lloyd leaves and follow him.)
  377: I have some stuff to take care of first. You wait here, I'll be back.
  378: I'm right behind you.
  385: |-
    Hmmmmm. I don't know you, friend...but I'm thinking I'd like to. Name's Lloyd. Some call me Pretty Boy
     Lloyd, but that's them, not me.
  386: |-
    Hmmmmm. I don't know you, sweetheart...but I'm thinking I'd like to. Name's Lloyd. Some call me Pretty Boy
     Lloyd, but that's them, not me.
  387: |-
    Hmmmmm. 'm not fool enough to turn down help from a beautiful woman. Name's Lloyd. Some call me Pretty Boy
     Lloyd, but that's them, not me.
  388: Pleased to meet you. So...about my offer...?
  395: |-
    The Salvatore family and I had a…disagreement over my success at one of their gambling tables.
     I think the matter can only be settled by removing myself as far from New Reno as possible.
  396: Success at their gambling tables, eh? How much you win, Lloyd?
  397: How can I help?
  398: What's in it for me?
  399: I don't think I can help you, Lloyd. I think we better just forget we met.
    Goodbye.
  405: |-
    Hmmmm…you look well-equipped to serve as a bodyguard. Help me get out of town. Escort me
     to the Gologtha plain to the south, and I can pay you some chips for your trouble.
  407: Done. Let's go. (Follow him.)
  415: |-
    (Pales, then regains composure.) Enough to get them mad. Most was spent in bribes keeping the Salvatore
     thugs off of my back long enough to slip down here and hide. I've been afraid to show myself in town…
  416: |-
    (Looks surprised, then regains composure.) Enough to get them mad. Most was spent in bribes keeping the Salvatore thugs off of
     my back long enough to slip down here and hide. I've been afraid to show myself in town…
  417: |-
    I'll help you, but I'll want half that money you won, Lloyd. Don't cheat me on this if you
     know what's good for you.
  418: |-
    Give me half of what you won at the tables, and I'll help you, Lloyd. It's a fair exchange
     to see that you get out of town in one piece.
  419: All right, I'll help you. Let's get outta here. (Follow him.)
  420: I don't think I can help you, Lloyd. Goodbye.
  425: |-
    (Looks like he's about to say something, thinks better of it, then nods.) Seems I got no
     choice. Let's go.
  427: |-
    No, you wait here and keep quiet until I come back. I got to take care of some stuff, then
     I'll be back and we'll go on our field trip.
  435: "(Stiffens.) Maybe. Who are you? I don't believe I've had the pleasure…"
  436: |-
    (Stiffens, then raises an eyebrow.) Maybe. I'm certain I would have remembered you, miss.
     I don't believe I've had the pleasure…?
  437: Dispense with the bullshit, Lloyd. I'm here for the money you stole from Mr.
    Salvatore.
  438: |-
    Look, Lloyd, hand over the cash and I MIGHT forget I ever saw you until you're far away
     from here.
  439: |-
    Lloyd, Mr. Salvatore sent me here to get his money back and have me make an…example of you.
     It doesn't need to be that way...IF the two of us can come to an arrangement.
  445: |-
    All right…all right now… (Swallows.) It's on the Golgotha plains south of Reno, buried in
     one of the graves. Only I know where it is, though.
  446: Show me.
  448: |-
    That's the biggest load of…oh hell, I'm just going to kill you and find the cash
     on my own.
  455: |-
    Hmmmmmm. I don't think either one of us believes that… (Swallows.) But maybe I can trust you.
     The money's buried on the Golgotha plains south of Reno, in one of the graves. Only I know where
     it is, though.
  459: Oh, forget this horseshit. I'm leaving. Keep your cash and your secret and
    get out of my sight.
  465: Hmmmm. An 'arrangement' you say…all right, all right…what is it you want?
  466: I'll get you out of town for half of that money you won from Mr. Salvatore,
    Lloyd.
  467: I'll get you out of town in exchange for all the money you won from Mr. Salvatore,
    Lloyd.
  468: |-
    Aw, nevermind. I don't want anything - get outta here before I change my mind.
     (Pretend to leave, hide, then follow him.)
  469: Aw, nevemind. I don't want anything - get outta here before I change my mind.
  475: |-
    Well, now...hmmmm...seems I got no choice. I'm going to have to take you to where the money is,
     though, cause you won't find it otherwise. Let's go.
  476: |-
    I have some stuff to take care of first. You wait here, I'll be back in a hour. (Pretend to
     leave, hide, then follow him.)
  477: |-
    No, you wait here until I come back. I got to take care of some stuff, then I'll be back
     for you and we'll go on our field trip.
  478: I'm right behind you. (Follow him.)
  555: "(Jumps.) Uh…ready to go?"
  556: Yes. Let's go. (Follow him.)
  557: No, you wait here until I come back. I got to take care of some stuff first.
  565: |-
    And as for your offer, I COULD use some help. See, I need to get out of town, but things
     have been complicated because of a certain…misunderstanding...
  566: What misunderstanding?
  585: Time to get the hell outta Reno…
  586: Damn box…
  587: Heavier than I remember…
  595: Here we are…
  596: It's this one right here.
  605: Here we are…*whew*...the money's in…this grave here.
  606: Dig it up, Lloyd.
  607: Let me take a look at this grave first...
  609: Well, stand back and let me dig it out...
  610: Get outta here, Lloyd. This money's mine now.
  615: "(Looks winded.) As...part of your…guard duties, I'd…be grateful if you'd...dig
    it up."
  616: Uh...
  617: There's two types of people in this world, Lloyd. Those with loaded guns and
    those that dig.
  620: All right then, I'll do it…
  625: "(Lloyd mumbles under his breath, then proceeds to dig.)"
  626: |-
    (Lloyd mumbles under his breath, then proceeds to dig...carefully. Less than a minute
     later, he pulls out a landmine from beneath the dirt and sets it aside. He shrugs sheepishly.)
  627: Thaaat's it. You're doing great. Keep it up. Dig a little faster.
  628: Nice one, Lloyd. KEEP digging. Let's see what else is under there.
  635: |-
    (A half-hour later, Lloyd has dug away enough dirt to reveal a small
     manhole cover set into the ground...you're certain you wouldn't have found it if Lloyd hadn't told you about it.
     Lloyd takes a deep breath and wipes his forehead.) Old...fallout...shelter.
  636: |-
    (A half-hour later, you have dug away enough dirt to reveal a small manhole cover set into
     the ground. You wouldn't have found it if Lloyd didn't tell you where to dig. As you uncover it, Lloyd speaks.)
     It's an old fallout shelter. Found it a week ago while checking out the area.
  637: Well, let me open this up, and we'll get down to business.
  638: Open the manhole, Lloyd.
  645: |-
    (The dirt around the grave looks like it has been disturbed recently. For some reason, the
     distance Lloyd is standing for the grave makes you wonder if it hasn't been trapped.)
  646: I think you should dig, Lloyd.
  647: Hmmmm. Let me take a closer look at the grave...
  648: Stand back, Lloyd. I'm going to start digging.
  655: |-
    (The dirt around the grave looks like it has been disturbed recently. This would make
     sense if Lloyd buried the chips here.)
  665: |-
    (You make an examination of the site, and brush away the dirt. As you do, you notice a
     landmine buried in the dirt. You disarm it carefully and stow it in your pack.)
  666: Forget about this, Lloyd? Let's see if you can forget THIS, dead man.
  667: I think YOU should dig, Lloyd. Get to it.
  668: I'll let this pass, Lloyd...this time. Now stand back while I keep digging.
  675: "(The manhole cover opens with a rusty shriek, revealing a dark hole leading
    downwards.)"
  676: Get in there, Lloyd.
  677: Stand back, Lloyd. I'm going in.
  685: |-
    (Lloyd frowns, thinks about making a comment, then shrugs and climbs down into the manhole
     cover.)
  686: Hurry up, Lloyd.
  687: HEY LLOYD, CATCH! (Drop the landmine down the hole.)
  688: I'm coming down after you, Lloyd.
  695: |-
    (You hear Lloyd grunting down below.) Hold on…almost got it… (There is the scraping of metal,
     then silence.)
  696: Get a move on, Lloyd. We haven't got all day.
  698: I'm coming down, Lloyd.
  706: All in a day's work...
  715: Right, right...all yours. No problem. I'm leaving. (Turns, then walks away.
  716: "(Let him go.)"
  717: "(Shoot him in the back.)"
  1000: |-
    After a long hike, you reach the Golgotha foothills. Once there, Lloyd leads you to one
     of the graves.
  1001: You follow Lloyd to Golgotha. Once there, he digs up one of the graves.
  1002: You lose Lloyd once you get outside of New Reno.
  1050: You let Lloyd leave.
  5213: " Me "
  7213: Who U
ncMason:
  100: You see Mason.
  150: You see a powerfully built middle-aged man with a receding hairline.
  151: You see Mason. He is watching you carefully.
  200: What're you doing up here?
  205: Well, check out this bouquet of assholes.
  210: Touch that door again, and I'll turn you into a torch.
  215: You can go on in…THIS time.
  220: You done walking in the wrong place, tribal. Get.
  221: This ain't no porn studio. Get.
  222: What're you doing here, punchy? Lose your way to the boxing ring? Get outta
    here.
  223: Get smart
  224: Oog make mission statement
  225: Wander off
  226: What's behind that door?
  227: I want to see Mr. Salvatore.
  228: Can I ask you where you get those laser pistols?
  229: Word is, you Salvatores poisoned that Wright kid.
  230: All right then, I'm leaving.
  240: Beat it, retard. I ain't gonna be telling you again.
  241: Tell me WHUT again?
  250: Life's full of disappointments. Now GET, capiche?
  251: "(Sarcastic.) Behind that door? That door right there? Why, that's Mr. SALVATORE'S
    room. Now BEAT it."
  252: I want to see Mr. Salvatore. I want a job.
  253: |-
    Look, dipshit…do you still want to have your job tomorrow? I have some info about one of the other families in Reno
     that Mr. Salvatore's going to want to hear. So let me speak to him NOW.
  254: Where do you get those laser pistols?
  265: "[]"
  266: |-
    Boy, you must be dumber than SHIT to be talking to me like that. One more word, just ONE more word, and
     yer a torch.
  267: |-
    Girl, you must be dumber than SHIT to be talking to me like that. One more word, just ONE more word, and
     yer a torch.
  268: I SAID, I want to see Mr. Salvatore.
  270: "(Leave quietly.)"
  275: "(His face reddens. He suddenly speaks to the air.) Excuse me, Mr. Salvatore,
    this is Mason. "
  276: This…man…says he's got something you wanna hear.
  277: This…woman…says she's got something you wanna hear.
  278: "(Wait...)"
  279: "(Attack Mason before he can continue.)"
  285: |-
    Look, maybe you ain't HEARD, tribal, but this's Salvatore's place. MY job is to make sure the boss
     ain't bothered by yapping dogs like you. Now run back to yer tribe and cook up one of yer people for dinner.
  295: |-
    These pistols? Aw, gee, I can't rightly say.  I just plumb forgot. (Scowls.) Look, tribal. If you don't
     shove off right now, I'm going to turn you into a torch. Now get.
  298: Okay! I'm going, I'm going.
  299: Leave quietly.
  305: 'I WARNED you, asshole, now you''re... (Mason suddenly pauses, listening to
    something you can''t hear. After a moment, his teeth clench.) Mr. Salvatore says
    you may come in... '
  1305: "."
  306: Oh, I'll be going in all right. After I kill you.
  307: Thanks, assholio, I'll be sure to mention your manners to Mr. Salvatore.
  308: All right then.
  315: "(Mason stops you.) Look… (Leans in, lowers voice.) ...some ground rules, boy. "
  316: 'Look… (Leans in, lowers voice.) ...Some ground rules, girl. '
  317: Don't waste Mr. Salvatore's time, and don't give him any bullshit, or you'll
    answer to me.
  318: Understood.
  319: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Get out of my way.
  325: |-
    (Mason stops you again.) I ain't DONE yet. You show him RESPECT. You call him *Mr. Salvatore* at all times,
     and when he talks, you *shut up and listen.* Understand?
  327: 'Last chance, Mason: Get the hell out of my way.'
  335: One day, you and me are gonna work out this problem you got with authority.
  336: I haven't got a problem. Everything's cool.
  337: Blow me.
  345: Awright, that DOES it, smartass! You crossed the line…(Cracks knuckles.)…now
    yer gonna get hurt.
  346: Hurt? William?
  347: Let's dance.
  348: No, YOU'RE the one who's gonna get HURT! You HEAR ME, MASON?! YOU'RE THE ONE
    WHO'S GONNA GET H --
  355: "'Bout time you showed, boy. "
  356: "'Bout time you showed, girl. "
  357: "'Bout time you showed. Don't know why Mr. Salvatore would hire porn trash,
    but I ain't gonna question him\n on it. "
  358: |-
    This bum that stole from Mr. Salvatore, his name's Lloyd. Mr. Salvatore wants him dead and that money
     he stole back. When you done the job, report back to ME, understand? Think you can handle that?
  359: Where can I find Lloyd?
  360: What does Lloyd look like?
  361: How much did he steal?
  362: Why aren't YOU tracking down Lloyd?
  364: Sure. Thanks, Mason.
  365: I can handle it. Now stand back and let me get to work.
  366: I already took care of the Lloyd "situation."
  375: Yeah? Like what?
  381: That's all I need to know. Thanks, Mason.
  382: That's all I need to know. Stand back and let me get to work, Mason.
  390: 'He''s been laying low, so tracking him down''s gonna be YOUR job, boy. '
  391: 'He''s been laying low, so tracking him down''s gonna be YOUR job, girl. '
  392: Best bet? Check some of the bars along Virgin street. Lloyd might be running
    another hustle there.
  393: I had some other questions…
  400: |-
    Lloyd? Hell…he's 'bout average height, white, brown hair. Last I saw him, he had a tan shirt, and dark
     brown scarf. He probably ain't changed his clothes since I saw him last.
  401: You know, oddly enough, that describes a LOT of people I've seen since I left
    Arroyo.
  410: |-
    Haw! You're telling me. Names are about the only way to tell people apart nowadays. You'd think there's
     only ten kinds of people in the world. (Leans in.) Way I figure it, there was some big cloning accident in the past.
  420: |-
    About a thousand chips. Now look, that ain't nothin' to Mr. Salvatore, but he's got this policy
     with regards to people who take ANYTHING from him. If I were you, I'd remember that. Mr. Salvatore's gonna want EVERY chip
     back.
  430: |-
    I been keeping my eyes open, but Lloyd's been pretty careful about keeping out of sight...from Salvatore
     eyes, anyway. I'm betting the boss figures you might have better luck, being new in town an' all.
  431: Yeah, whatever. I'm outta --
  432: I had some other qu --
  433: All right then, I'll go check --
  440: All right then.
  442: That's all I need to know. Now back off and let me get to work.
  465: You found Lloyd yet?
  466: "(Scowls.) You BETTER have some good news for me. You found Lloyd yet?"
  467: "(Scowls.) You BETTER have some good news for Mr. Salvatore or yer gonna be
    sleeping with the radscorpions."
  468: No, not yet. I had some more questions about Lloyd…
  470: Yeah, I found Lloyd.
  472: No, I think he left town with the cash.
  473: Not yet. Sorry to bother you.
  480: |-
    Hold on a minute there, speedy. I'll make this REAL clear so you can understand: Don't talk to me again until
     you find Lloyd. Or you're gonna make me mad. Now do your JOB.
  481: All right, all right…
  482: Bite me, Mason.
  490: |-
    I told you not to come back until you found Lloyd…I TOLD you. (Taps his head.) Are you stupid?! Must be,
     cause here you are talking to me again. Stupid…and DEAD.
  491: Let's go, shitheel.
  492: Bring it on.
  493: No, YOU'RE the one who's STUPID AND DEAD! You HEAR ME, MASON?! YOU'RE THE ONE
    WHO'S STU --
  500: "(Stares at you in disbelief.) You screwed it up. We give you a simple job,
    and you screw. It. Up. "
  501: 'You must be the STUPIDEST son of a bitch alive. '
  502: 'You must be the STUPIDEST bitch alive. '
  503: "(Sneers, reaches for weapons.) Time to die, tribal."
  506: No, YOU'RE the one who's gonna DIE! You HEAR ME, MASON?! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
    GONNA D --
  514: Well, why the hell didn't you say so in the FIRST place, idiot? Go tell Mr.
    Salvatore what you found.
  515: "(Nods, frowning slightly.) Well, awright then…go tell Mr. Salvatore what you
    found."
  516: |-
    Oh, REALLY? Is THAT what I should do? Thanks, Mason. Without you, I wouldn't even know how to get
     from place to place. Sheesh. Idiot.
  517: All right.
  520: You done the job yet?
  525: Go see Mr. Salvatore. He's waiting for you.
  530: |-
    Awright, then. You're gonna be a one-man collection agency. Drill's simple: Visit Renesco's Pharmacy
     on Commercial Row, collect the tribute, 1000 chips, then bring it back here.
  531: All right...anything else?
  535: You collect the tribute yet?
  536: "(Frowns.) You collect the tribute yet?"
  537: "(Scowls.) You BETTER have the money this time, dipshit. Mr. Salvatore's waiting."
  539: Where was I supposed to collect from again?
  540: Renesco's giving me shit. Says he gave two weeks ago, and he shouldn't have
    to pay for another month.
  542: Uh...got it. Here's the money.
  543: Did it, but I don't have the money on me…
  544: Almost. I'll have it next time, Mason.
  546: I got your tribute right here...dead man.
  555: "*Renesco's Pharmacy.* On the West Side. A thousand chips.  Now get going."
  556: That's all I need to know. Now stand back and let me get to work, Mason.
  565: |-
    Hold on a minute there, speedy. I'll make this REAL clear so you can understand: Don't talk to me again
     until you get that money from Renesco. Or you're gonna make me mad. Now do your JOB.
  575: |-
    I told you not to come back until you got that money…I TOLD you. (Taps his head.) Are you stupid?!
     Must be, cause here you are talking to me again. Stupid…and DEAD.
  585: "(Mason's eyes narrow.) So friggin' what? You tell him who you worked for?"
  586: Yes.
  587: Well, no.
  595: Then did you SHOW him who you worked for?
  596: Show him?
  598: Uh, no. I'll have it next time, Mason.
  605: |-
    What, I gotta hold your HAND?! Easiest goddamn thing in the world, and you come crying to me
     'May-son, May-son, so and so ain't paying his tribute.'
  606: Now hold on...
  615: "(As soon as he sees you, Mason sneers.) Just the dumb mother fucker I was
    looking for. "
  617: You can't collect tribute from dead people. (Reaches for his weapons.) You
    done screwed up but GOOD.
  618: Yeah, well, I was getting tired of you anyway...
  619: No, YOU'RE the one who's DONE SCREWED UP BUT GOOD! You HEAR ME, MASON?! YOU'RE
    THE ONE WHO'S DONE FU --
  625: |-
    (Mason nods, seems disappointed.) Heh. Thought we'd bled ol' Renesco of his last dime. All right then,
     well…take it in to the boss. (Frowns.) Go on now.
  635: Get outta here. Mr. Salvatore don't want to do business with you no more.
  640: |-
    Awright, the boss says you're coming along on a little TRANSACTION we're doing. Make sure you come
     armed…don't bring no pea-shooters…then come back and talk to me.
  642: Mr. Salvatore said you were to give me a laser pistol.
  643: What is this transaction were doing?
  644: I'm ready to go right now. Let's do it.
  645: Give me some time to get ready, and I'll come back.
  655: |-
    Yeah, that's the word. Here you go…don't be playing with it, neither. You hurt ANYONE with that thing,
     and I'll shoot you dead.
  656: Can you teach me how to use this?
  658: All right then, I'm good to go. Let's do it.
  665: |-
    (Sneers.) If the boss didn't tell you, then you ain't gotta know. So shut your hole…and don't be
     telling anyone about what's going on, neither, or I'll make sure you never say anything again.
  675: Let's go then.
  676: Follow him and the other Salvatores into the desert...
  685: |-
    Make sure you hurry up. We only got a 24 hour window before the deal's off. You miss it, and I'll make sure
     you rot in Golgotha.
  686: Don't you worry. I'll be there.
  695: You got enough beauty sleep? Maybe NOW yer ready to go?
  696: What is this transaction were doing again?
  697: Yes. Let's do it.
  698: I need a little more time, then I'll be back.
  699: Can you teach me how to use this pistol?
  705: I been itching to kill you for a LONG time… I WARNED you what would happen
    if you were late.
  706: Well, pardon fucking me for not having a watch.
  707: No, YOU'RE the one was WARNED! You HEAR ME, MASON?! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WAS
    WARN --
  715: |-
    Why izzit you gotta question every thing I say?! Look: The OTHER party at this transaction ain't gonna
     be hurt by these lightbringers, okay? So make sure you have something ELSE with you.
  725: |-

    Yeah, you mentioned that before. If I were you, Ramirez, I'd do all humanity a favor and take that entire box
     of Jet all at once. See you.
  492: Boy, am I glad someone had the wisdom to give you all automatic weapons. Makes
    me feel safe. Later, Ramirez.
  493: "(Blinks.) Eh...? What you say?"
  494: Forget it. Go squat on a firearm and pull the trigger, all right?
  495: Nothing. If I were you, Ramirez, I'd do all humanity a favor and take that
    entire box of Jet all at once. See you.

  390: Nah. You ain't gonna see him. Now piss off before you make me angry.
  391: Can you at least give him a message for me?
  400: Nope. Now piss OFF, you little shit.

  340: One of my sons…my boy, Richard, passed away recently. Chem overdose. Jet.
  341: How can I help?
  342: Uh…I don't really see how I can --
  350: |-
    I want to know what dealer gave that SHIT to Richard and forced him to take it. Every time I send my boys to find out,
     they turn up nothin'. Maybe somebody who ain't got Wright blood could get some answers.
  351: Uh, "forced him to take it?"
  352: I'll take the job.
  353: No, this job isn't my style. I better be going.
  360: |-
    (Face turns red.) My boys are clean, and they know to stay away from that shit, or I'll kill them. Then SUDDENLY, Richie ODs.
     Someone pumped a ton of Jet in him, so much that fumes was runnin' outta his nose.
  361: Well…that doesn't mean someone else is responsible. Your son could have taken
    too much. Jet is highly habit-forming.
  362: Hmmm. I'll take the job.
  370: |-
    (Nods.) All right then. Now look: You find that son of a bitch who killed my boy, don't you touch 'im…you just come back
     and TELL me the dead man's name. (Eyes blaze.) I'LL take care of it from there.
  371: We haven't talked a price.

  373: Find the person who gave him the Jet, don't hurt them, just come back and tell
    you. Got it.
  380: |-
    Yer right, we ain't talked price, cause you ain't done nothing BUT talk. I'm letting you prove your worth. Do your job,
     and you don't need to worry about money. I give you my word as a Wright.
  383: Forget this, then. Only fools work for nothing. I'm out of here.
  390: |-
    (Eyes blaze.) No…everybody's too scared to talk…to a Wright, anyway. If I were you, I would 'question' some of the Reno
     chem pushers, see what they know. That Jet came from SOMEWHERE.

  393: Look, this job isn't my style. I better be going.

  403: Jagged Jimmy J, the dealer on 2nd Street.
  404: That old geezer, Renesco the Rocketman.
  405: Lil' Jesus Mordino. He deals Jet.
  406: Your son didn't die of an overdose. He was poisoned.

    That so? Word is, the bastard's ALREADY dead, but I ain't telling you nothing new. I TOLD you not to touch him
     - you screwed up. Now, YOU'RE dead.

  417: Oh, yeah, well --
  425: That bastard's seen his last days. Come morning, he'll be dead. But he'll be
    a LONG time dying…
  426: Now, about the price for doing my work…
  427: No less than he deserves.
  428: |-
    Uh, but Renesco didn't give Richard the Jet...he didn't know who it was for...it was the SALVATORES
     that poisoned your son.
  435: 'I owe you…I owe you. '
  436: 'Well now, before I get into specifics, let''s settle accounts first… '
  437: |-
    Here's a little cash for your trouble, plus some ammo, liquor from my private stock… and another
     job for you, if you're interested.
  438: I'm interested.
  439: No thanks. I'll see you around.
  445: |-
    If you come back here again and you ain't done what I asked, I'll see you hang in Golgotha, tribal. NO ONE

    If you think you can jerk me around on this, tribal, you're dead wrong. I've HAD it with your bullshit. (Starts shouting.)
     Boys! Get in here!

  448: I'm not the one for this job, Mr. Wright. Find somebody else.
  449: Fuck this job, fuck your dead chem-using son, and fuck you. I'm outta here.
  451: That DOES it! I'm sick of your bullshit. You'll be joining your dead chem-using
    son in hell.
  453: Get out of here.
  465: It so happens, not too long ago, I came across a map that shows an old army
    base in the mountains not far from here. You find a way in there, and I'll see
    that you're taken care of…
  466: Okee Dokee Mister Orderville
  467: " go. "
  468: All right. I'll go check it out.
  469: Why should I go? Didn't you send somebody already?
  470: Not interested, thanks. Goodbye.
  471: |-
    I already found a way to get inside the base. There's a lot of old weapons
     and military hardware there, all for the taking.
  472: |-
    I already found a way inside the base. Problem is, there was an... accident...
     the base is contaminated.
  480: |-
    (Mr. Wright's expression tightens for a moment, then he snorts.) Heh. Not exactly. The fellas I got the map from are dead.
     They were a tough bunch, but they all got wiped out tryin' to get inside the base.
  481: They didn't even get INSIDE?
  485: |-
    Yeah, the only survivor said…shortly before his unfortunate death…said that there were some kind of super gun turrets
     guarding the entrance. Wiped out most of his boys.
  486: What happened to the survivor?
  487: Hmmmm. I'll have to be careful then. I'll take the job.
  488: Forget this. No one said it would be that dangerous.
  495: |-
    Oh, ol' Sam Pritchard? Sad story. Got drunk one night, mentioned to my boy Keith he'd found this 'base,' and 'fore y'know
     it, he draws me a map and DIES. He's sleeping in Golgotha now.
  496: Seems like Reno's filled with sad stories these days. I'll take the job.
  497: Y'know, it's stories like that that make me realize I really can't take this
    job. Later, Wright.
  505: "(Shakes his head.) Too bad. You come back and see me if you change your mind."
  506: I'll do that.
  515: "(Wright smiles when he sees you.) You change your mind about that proposition
    I had?"
  516: What was this proposition again?
  517: No, just stopping by. I'll be going now.
  525: |-
    (Nods, smiles.) All right then. Come back when you found a way in, and I'll see you're well rewarded. Now, as for
     the location of the base…head north, then… (Gives you the coordinates for the army base.)
  526: All right. I'll go check it out. When I find a way inside, I'll be back.
  535: Ah, it's you. You got some good news for me? You find a way into that army
    base?
  536: If you're back and ain't done what I asked, then you're in for a world of hurt.
  537: Not yet.
  538: |-
    Yes. I managed to get inside and found a lot of old weapons and military hardware there. It's all there for the taking.
     Now, about my payment…
  539: I got inside the base, but there was an…accident…the base is contaminated.
  540: Sorry. I'll return once I get inside the Army base.
  541: Screw this job, and screw you. I'm outta here.
  550: |-
    If you ain't DONE what I asked, then what in HELL are you doing back here?! I need you to crack that base, so don't
     be coming back here until you've done it!
  551: All right. I'll return once I get inside the Army base.
  560: |-
    If you come back here again and you ain't done what I asked, I'll see you hang in Golgotha, tribal. NO ONE wastes my
     time. You understand me?
  561: |-
    Sorry? SORRY?! That don't cut it this time, tribal. If you think you can waste my time, you're wrong. I can get
     someone else to fill your shoes. (Shouts at door.) Boys! Get in here!
  562: Understood. I'll be back when I've done the job.
  575: |-
    . I like it, I like it. It's got style. Now you stop on by the Cat's Paw and New Reno Arms, and they'll take care of
     you. You need free hootch, head on by the train station, too. I'll set you up.
  576: Thanks. I'll do that.
  580: "(Eyes gleam.) You done good, "
  581: An 'accident?' Aw, hell, I don't even want to know. Get outta here and don't
    ever come back.
  582: Thanks, Mr. Wright. If I'm a Made Man, then I'd like to be called…
  583: All right then.
  584: So what do you want us to call ya?
  590: "(Smiles when he sees you.) "
  591: Sure. How are things with you, Mr. Wright?
  592: Sure. I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.
  600: "(Chuckles.) Not bad, not bad. My wife is still being a holy terror, but that's
    nothing new. The joys of marriage."
  601: I understand. Well, I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.
  610: Angry? Hell, yes, my goddamn wife just went berserk on one of my stills. Don't
    know how the hell she found out, but…
  611: Angry? Hell, yes, some low-down sonuvabitch destroyed one of my stills. Don't
    know how the hell he pulled it off, but…
  612: |-
    Angry? Hell, yes, my customers are dropping off...literally. Something's wrong with the alcohol, and I think it's killing
     people. I wonder if the fermenting process is poisonous...
  613: She probably just stumbled across it. Dumb luck, no doubt! I don't think anyone
    told her, nope. Very unlikely.
  614: Well, those old machines break down all the time! I don't think anyone did
    it on purpose. Very unlikely.
  615: |-
    Well, it certainly couldn't have anything to do with radscorpion venom leaking into the vats from a severed radscorpion
     tail being dropped in there. I wouldn't dwell on it.
  620: |-
    Funny you should ask. My son got a gun from somewhere…I think it's one of the other families, trying to get him to shoot
     himself or his old man. When I catch the bastard…
  621: |-
    Uh, a gun? Really? You're right, sir, probably one of the other families gave it to him. Be hard to track down whoever
     did it, though. I wouldn't pay it any mind.
  625: "(Nods.) Probably nothing. Aw, well…"
  626: Sure. Oh, well, I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.
  630: |-
    (Frowns.) Way I see it, it was probably a Mordino pusher…that goddamn family controls nearly all the Jet in Reno.
     I'd scope out the Desperado, see what dealers hang out round there.
  640: Wh -? "Poisoned?" What in hell's name are you talking about?
  641: I inspected your son's body. Jet didn't kill him...his body still had traces
    of radscorpion venom in it.
  642: |-
    I found this Jet canister that Richard used… er, was used on Richard. There were traces of radscorpion venom
     in the cartridge.
  643: |-
    I found a Jet canister that Richard used… er, was used on Richard. There were traces of radscorpion venom
     in the cartridge.
  644: He was poisoned with radscorpion venom. The Jet overdose was just a cover for
    the poisoning.
  650: '"Inspected my son''s body?"'
  651: Yeah, I had to open his grave to do an autopsy.
  652: Uh…you know, I DIDN'T. I misspoke. "Son's body?" I meant "somebody's." Yes,
    that's what I meant.
  653: This might not be the best time to discuss this. I'll talk to you later.
  660: You ghoulish son of a bitch…
  661: You ghoulish bitch…
  662: |2-
     you just earned YOURSELF a plot o' land on Golgotha. IF they find all the pieces. (Starts shouting.) Boys! Get in here!
     And bring yer knives!
  663: Hold on! Can't we talk about this?
  664: You're going to need more than knives to take me down…
  665: Excuse me. The exit and I have an appointment.
  670: |-
    Assuming I believe this for a second... and I ain't saying I AM... then who POISONED my son? And why did they go to the
     trouble of dosin' him with Jet?
  671: Word is it was the Salvatores. They pumped him with Jet laced with radscorpion
    venom, then left him for you to find.
  672: |-
    I don't know which of the Salvatores did it. Renesco doctored up some Jet for them, not knowing they'd use it to
     poison your son.
  673: I don't know.
  680: Now why in hell would they do that?
  681: |-
    Way I see it, the Mordinos control the Jet in Reno. Naturally, you'd blame them for a chem overdose... and then there'd
     be war. IF you two didn't wipe each other out, you'd at least be weakened by the fight. That makes life easier for the
     Salvatores…all they have to worry about then is the Bishops.
  682: I don't know. Maybe you should ask them.
  690: |-
    (Stares at you for a long time, then a dry chuckle escapes his lips.) You give me an answer, and I can't do nothing about
     it. The Salvatores…goddammit. (Takes a deep breath.)
  691: What's wrong?
  692: '"You can''t do anything about it?" What do you mean?'
  700: |-
    Know what those Salvatore bastards are ARMED with, friend? Those damned lightbringers. ONE Salvatore packing that kind
     of heat can kill my whole family without batting an eye. To beat that, I'd need…
  701: What?
  702: Don't worry about it, I've kicked the shins out from underneath the Salvatores
    already.
  710: |-
    Ha! The ones in Reno maybe, but you got a lot to learn about the families... there's still Salvatores kicking
     around beyond Reno, and even if there's just one left, that's trouble. To beat them, I'd need...
  720: "(Frown deepens.) This smells like a pile of brahmin shit to me..."
  721: Don't believe me? Look, I inspected your son's body, and it REEKED of radscorpion
    venom.
  722: |-
    Look, trust me... your son was POISONED. I don't know by who, but somebody went to great pains to make it look like a
     Jet overdose.
  750: You have solved the murder.
  775: You fingered a suspect in Richard Wright's death.
  800: You have correctly identified who killed Richard Wright and the motive.
  825: You have become a made man of the Wright family.
  5243: "!"
  5249: ". I'm interested in a job."
  5261: "!"
  5310: ." Glad you stopped by, damn neighborly of you. (Sneer crumbles into a frown.)
    Looking for work in family Wright, huh?
  5467: " crack base. "
  6467: " smash!"
  5580: |-
    . Go to the Cat's Paw and New Reno Arms…tell them you're from me, and they'll set you up. You're family now…a made
     man, and all Reno's gonna know it.
  5590: "…everyone treating you all right? No problems?"

  612: Golgotha's south of Reno, in the desert.
  613: I may be poor, but not in spirit.
  614: I'm not poor, I just have rotten luck.
  615: That stink from Golgotha was damn awful last night…
  616: Dammit! See, I was up 53 chips, then…
  617: You better be careful around these parts, or you'll be bound for Golgotha.

  563: New blood in town…
  564: Still don't know why they call it Virgin Street…
  565: I wish he'd wear a paper bag sometimes…
  566: Buy a girl a drink?
  567: Take a lonely lady on the town?
  568: Oh, boy! A tourist!
  569: Come over here, honey, the show's about to begin…
  570: I heard some of the girls uptown killed their pimp.
  571: Hellooooo, stranger.
  572: That Jules better leave me alone.
  573: Still got that bruise from the headboard…
  574: Been worn out ever since that last convention…
  575: I wish those tribals would go to some other town.
  576: I felt the Earth move, but it was just the chili.
  577: Make me melt.
  578: He keeps it up, he's gonna bust his ticker…
  579: The buzzing of the neon keeps driving me crazy...
  580: I'm a virgin. I'm just not very good at it.
  581: To think I came from the Den for this...
  582: Hey, stranger! Need a guide?
  583: Jules keeps wanting freebies.
  584: I hear the families are getting tense again.
  585: Things are pretty slow. I wish that caravan would show.
  586: So he dresses up in this Deathclaw costume, then…
  587: I need help getting out of this dress.
  588: Zip me up? Then down again?
  589: Mmm-mmm. Looks like mating season.
  590: Wanna waste some time?
  591: I kicked Jules in his family jewels last week.
  592: They don't call me Lady Lucky for nothing.
  593: Love those brahmin-flavored condoms.
  594: Show a lady a good time?
  595: Wish they would invent a sexual placebo for Myron.
  596: Need a date, tribal?
  597: Want to pow-wow, tribal?
  598: Want to do the rain dance in my bedroom, tribal?
  599: All you need is one night with me.
  600: Looking for the Garden of Eden? Come to my bedroom.
  601: You got the chips, I got the time.
  602: Can you help me? I'm looking for my lost virginity.
  603: I'm a virgin, but I need the money.
  604: Be gentle, it's my first time. Today.
  605: Me so horny.
  606: You got the craving, I got the saving.
  607: Let me awaken your inner child.
  608: Wanna dance, sweetheart?
  609: Lookin' to stake a claim?
  610: Wanna make me moan?
  611: "::Purrrrr::"
  612: "::Rrrrrowrrr::"
  613: "::Blows you a kiss::"
  614: Been up since last night...
  615: I'm not cheap, but I am on special.
  616: Tying you up costs extra.
  617: Where did I leave my whip?
  618: Ready like a freddie.
  619: I had to dress up like WILMA last night, fer Chrissakes.
  620: I was with Myron last night. For about five seconds.
  621: Looking to pop a clip?
  622: Wish they'd come out with some Jet-smelling body oils...
  623: Want to help a virgin lose her virginity?
  624: My ass is going to fall off, Myron keeps it up.
  625: Damn Temperance Union came around again…
  626: "::Whistles::"
  627: Biting is extra.
  628: I guarantee I'm better than that Pip Boy attachment you've been using.
  629: Want me to tighten your screws?
  630: I'd rather be with Avellone.
  631: I wish Nick Kesting was here. We could talk for hours!
  632: Nick Kesting is a really nice guy. We have great conversations.
  633: Tommy the Balls is sooo dreamy.
  634: Well, well. Look who just rolled into town.
  635: Looking for the Garden of Eden? Come to my bedroom.
  636: Take a gamble on me, honey.
  637: My name's Easy, girl. What's yours?
  638: Hey, cutie. Looking for the other woman?
  639: Looking for a taste of the other side, sweetheart?
  640: Need a little company?
  641: Girl, let me teach you some things only a WOMAN can teach.
  642: Need someone to warm your tent, girl?
  643: Need someone to share your bedroll, girl?
  644: Wanna dance, girl?
  645: Forget the slot machines, girl. My payoff's MUCH better.
  646: Girl, you ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  647: Wanna fly, girl?
  648: Lose your way, cowgirl?
  649: Got a gun you need to unload, G.I. Jane?
  650: Looking for a good time, girl?
  651: Looking to go down-town, girlie?
  652: You need a guide around town, sugah?
  653: Where's the fire, girl?
  654: That woman makes my Geiger counter tick.
  655: My name's Easy. What's yours?
  656: Need a little company?
  657: Let me teach you some things only a woman can teach.
  658: Need someone to warm your tent?
  659: Need someone to share your bedroll?
  660: Got some hot-rocks there, pal.
  661: Nasty little crotch cobra there.
  662: Lookin' for some action?
  663: You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  664: Looking for a date?
  665: Heard there was some trouble on Commercial Row...
  666: Looking for some company?
  667: Only sports going on in Reno nowdays in tonsil hockey...
  668: Wanna dance?
  669: Forget the slot machines. My payoff's MUCH better.
  670: I can't believe how many strippers were at Feargus' bachelor party.
  671: New stranger in town, looks like…
  672: Can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?
  673: Wanna fly?
  674: Haven't seen any caravans from Redding in a while...
  675: Nice dill.
  676: Let me cheer you up, sad clown.
  677: Lose your way, cowboy?
  678: Got a gun you need to unload, soldier?
  679: That man could melt metal.
  680: Too many streetwalkers in this town, not enough chips to go around.
  681: Been walking this street since last night...
  682: Need a friend for the evening? Or just ten minutes?
  683: Looking for a good time?
  684: Looking to go down-town?
  685: I like the look of your gecko.
  686: That a gecko in your pocket?
  687: Need a guide around town, sugah?
  688: Where's the fire?
  689: Childe, let me make you a man.
  690: Mmmmm-mmmmm.
  691: Wanna pretend we're deathclaws in mating season?
  692: That man makes my Geiger counter tick.
  693: If I have to talk to you aftewards, that's extra.
  694: Anything I can help you with, stranger?
  695: You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  696: I finally installed that padded headboard.
  697: Taste of paradise'll cost you ten chips.
  698: 'Myron: All wax. No wick.'
  699: Myron's a real twister.
  700: AC-DC, B n' D, whatever.
  701: What does he expect me to do, bend down for him?
  702: Keep thinking that Reno sign's gonna fall down...
  703: That Bishop girl is a bed-bunny.
  704: She ain't no Jet reliant, she's a BONE reliant.
  705: I heard Vault City has only two types of Citizens. Maybe it was some cloning
    accident.
  706: Felt like I was in a marathon last night...
  707: Looking for love, honey?
  708: Wish Myron would move away. Far away.
  709: I can do ANYTHING you want...for the right price.
  710: I'm ready to go, honey. How about you?
  711: "::Whistles at you::"
  712: I hate teabags.
  713: Take a gamble on me, honey.
  714: Looking for a good time?
  715: Pure Reno love, right here.
  716: I'll give you some play.
  717: I'm Filthy Spice.
  718: I'm Homely Spice.
  719: I'm Slutty Spice.
  720: I'm Old Spice.
  721: I'm Syphilis…er, Slutty Spice.
  722: I'm Dirty Spice.
  723: Wranglers in the dust, that's what I want.
  724: I've got a girlfriend if you want a double-header.
  725: Wish Myron was gay.
  726: New blood in town…
  727: Still don't know why they call it Virgin Street…

  738: Wish tribals would stop coming through here.
  739: I felt the Earth move, but it was just the chili.
  740: Make me melt.
  741: He keeps it up, he's gonna bust his ticker…
  742: Buzzing of the neon is driving me crazy...

  816: Where's the fire, girl?
  817: That woman makes my Geiger counter tick.
  818: The Enclave? President? Tell me the whole story.
  819: Tom French scripted me. He has soft, gentle hands.
  820: They were still fighting the WAR? Really! Good thing you wasted those bastards.
  821: |-
    You are a total badass. I mean, you start from a simple spear-chucking tribal
     - no offense - and go on to save the whole world. You kick ass. End of story.
  822: You should replay the game as a different kind of character.
  823: Tell me everything about your fight with the Enclave…
  824: Hey, if you want a freebie after saving the world, I'm sure you can talk me
    into it…
  825: |-
    I don't know how you survived those Enclave bastards, but you are the bravest person I've
     ever known.
  826: Tim Cain? Yes, he's one of my regulars.
  827: Kiss me, you Enclave-busting animal.
  828: I hear the Brothers are looking for you. They want to do a film based on your
    adventure.
  829: We miss Tim Cain. He used to cook wonderful bread. Then he would spank us like
    small children.
  830: I realize I'm just an NPC, but I'm deeply offended by the way women are portrayed
    in New Reno.
  831: |-
    Women in this town seem like they were designed by some immature sex-starved geek
     who lives in his parent's basement.
  832: New Reno was designed by Chris Avellone and Tom French. Both of them are sexual
    GODS.
  833: |-
    Feargus got that frowny-look on his face when he saw how many float text messages I have.
     He's such a sour-puss.
  834: You score is 192 out of 208. You really should have used the mutated toe on
    Horrigan.
  835: Some woman must have broken your heart terribly for you to have retreated inside
    that armored suit. Let me help.
  836: Look, Tin Man, if you want me to dress up as Dorothy or Toto, that's extra.
  837: Look, pal, if you want to do it, you'll have to get outta there; the metal
    hurts and leaves scars.
  838: Is there a trapdoor, or do you have to get out of that thing to get a handjob?
  839: If you get an erection in that thing, do you bruise?
  840: Looks like you brought your own condom.
  841: Is that some new body condom?
  842: You must really be afraid of STDs to be in that thing.
  843: If you want me to have sex with you in that thing, that's extra.
  844: If you want to get it on, you'll have to step outta there.
  845: Will my moisture make you rust?
  846: Well…okay. But no way in HELL are you going to be on top.
  847: How the hell do you go to the bathroom with that thing on?
  848: Am I going to need the Jaws of Life to get you outta there?
  849: Is that some new kind of vibrator?
  850: I think I saw this same situation in an Anime video once.
  851: Are you sure you aren't looking for a car wash?
  852: Look, honey, you'll have to get outta there; the metal hurts and leaves scars.
  853: Is that some new birth control device you're wearing?
  854: Want to jump in the ring with me, honey? I can last at least 12 rounds.
  855: 'Wanna box, '
  856: Girl, you are such a badass.
  857: Wow, look at your muscles. You're tougher than a lot of men I know. And I know
    a LOT of men.
  858: 'How''s it going, '
  859: Looking for me?
  860: Why don't you come around more often?
  861: 'Need some company, '
  862: Nice rack you got there.
  863: Hey…watch out for the Masticator. He's a real jerk. He tried to bite my ear
    off once.
  864: You're pretty sexy, girl, y'know that?
  865: "[]"
  866: If you're looking for a little company later…
  867: "[]"
  868: 'Hello, '
  869: Put in a good word with the boss for me?
  870: 'Well, if it isn''t the devilish '
  871: I can do ANYTHING you want...it's all for the asking.
  872: Put in a good word with the boss for me?
  873: "[]"
  874: Um, if you're looking for a little company later, ma'am…
  875: My name's Easy, slaver. What's yours?
  876: Need someone to yank your leash, slaver?
  877: Why don't you take me back to your cage, slaver?
  878: Need your cage rattled, slaver?
  879: You're a frisky slaver, aren't you?
  880: Did you bring your own towelette?
  881: Yes, they ARE real, and NO, you can't check.
  882: Wanna wrangle, cowboy?
  883: Wanna sink me with your pink torpedo?
  884: Let me teach you some things only a woman can teach.
  885: Need someone to warm your tent, slaver?
  886: Need someone to share your bedroll, slaver?
  887: Got some hot-rocks there, slaver.
  888: Nasty little crotch cobra you got there, slaver.
  889: Lookin' for some action?
  890: You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  891: Looking for a date?
  892: Look, no free samples.
  893: Heard there was some trouble on Commercial Row...
  894: Looking for some company?
  895: Only sports going on in Reno nowdays in tonsil hockey...
  896: Wanna dance, slaver?
  897: Slaver, you ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  898: I can't believe how many strippers were at Feargus' bachelor party.
  899: My job? I turn boys into MEN.
  900: Can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?
  901: I've been in this town too long...
  902: Need a friend for the evening, slaver? Or just ten minutes?
  903: Wanna fly?
  904: Haven't seen any caravans from Redding in a while...
  905: Nice dill.
  906: Lose your way, slaver?
  907: Got a gun you need to unload, slaver?
  908: Anything I can help you with, stranger?
  909: I like the look of your gecko, slaver.
  910: That a gecko in your pocket?
  911: Need a guide around town, sugah?
  912: Where's the fire, slaver?
  913: Childe, let me make you a man.
  914: Wanna dance, slaver?
  915: Oh, hello, Mr. Tyler. Going…down?
  916: If I have to talk to you afterwards, that's extra.
  917: Yes, they ARE real, and NO, you can't check.
  918: This one guy, Fred Hatch, he wanted to know if there were any "big girls" in
    town. Weird.
  919: '[Sings.] "Let''s play - master and servant. Let''s play - master and servant."'
  920: Wanna play master and servant, slaver?
  921: If you want me to stay awake afterwards, that's extra.
  922: Wanna go to Where the Wild Things Are?
  923: Forget the slot machines. My payoff's MUCH better.
  924: I'm not cheap, but I am on special.
  925: I'll fit you like a flesh tuxedo.
  926: Talk about mudflaps, baby, I got 'em.
  927: Well, well. Look who just rolled into town...
  928: Looking for the Garden of Eden? Come to my bedroom.
  929: Lookin' for some action?
  930: When in doubt, whip it out.
  931: I finally installed that padded headboard.
  932: Taste of paradise'll cost you ten chips.
  933: 'Myron: All wax. No wick.'
  934: Myron's a real twister.
  935: AC-DC, B n' D, whatever.
  936: That Bishop girl is a bed-bunny.
  937: She ain't no Jet reliant, she's a BONE reliant.
  938: I heard Vault City has only two types of Citizens. Maybe it was some cloning
    accident.
  939: Felt like I was in a marathon last night...
  940: Looking for love, honey?
  941: No kissing. It's the rule.
  942: Wish Myron would move away. Far away.
  943: I can do ANYTHING you want, slaver...for the right price.
  944: I'm ready to go, honey. How about you?
  945: Forget the slot machines. My payoff's MUCH better.
  946: I hate teabags.

  956: I'm Dirty Spice.
  957: Say…I've got a girlfriend if you want a double-header.
  958: Wish Myron was gay.
  959: Still don't know why they call it Virgin Street…
  960: I wish he'd wear a paper bag sometimes.
  961: Buy me a drink, slaver?
  962: Take a lonely lady on the town, slaver?
  963: Uh, of course I'm a woman. Just ignore the Adam's apple.
  964: I heard some of the girls uptown killed their pimp.
  965: Helloooo, stranger.
  966: That Jules better leave me alone.
  967: Still got that bruise from the headboard…
  968: Been worn out ever since that last slaver convention.
  969: I wish Gen Con took place in some other town.
  970: You could melt metal, you know that?
  971: I felt the Earth move, but it was just the chili.
  972: Make me melt.
  973: I'm a virgin. I'm just not very good at it.
  974: Need a guide around town, slaver?
  975: Whoa. THAT'LL cost extra.
  976: Jules keeps wanting freebies.
  977: I hear the families are getting tense again.
  978: Things are pretty slow. I wish that caravan would show.
  979: So he dresses up in this Deathclaw costume, then…
  980: I need help getting out of this dress.
  981: Zip me up? Then down again?
  982: Sorry, what were you saying? I was too busy staring at your ass.
  983: Wanna waste some time?
  984: Looking for a good time?
  985: I kicked Jules in his family jewels last week.
  986: Looking to go down-town?
  987: They don't call me Lady Lucky for nothing.
  988: Of COURSE I love those brahmin-flavored condoms. Yum.
  989: Show a lady a good time, slaver?
  990: Wish they would invent a sexual placebo for Myron.
  991: Need a date, slaver?
  992: Slaver, all you need is one night with me.
  993: Looking for the Garden of Eden? Come to my bedroom.
  994: You got the chips, slaver, I got the time.
  995: Can you help me? I'm looking for my lost virginity.
  996: I'm a virgin, but I need the money.
  997: Be gentle, it's my first time. Today.
  998: Me so horny.
  999: You got the craving, I got the saving.
  1000: Let me awaken your inner child.
  1001: I'm just doing this to pay for college.
  1002: Look, for the last time, I don't want to dress up as the "Vault Dweller."
  1003: Lookin' to stake a claim?
  1004: Wanna make me moan?
  1005: "::Purrrrr::"
  1006: "::Rrrrrowrrr::"
  1007: Stop tickling me.
  1008: Been up since last night...
  1009: Wanna pretend we're deathclaws in mating season?
  1010: I'm not cheap, but I am on special.
  1011: Tying you up costs extra.
  1012: Where did I leave my whip?
  1013: Ready like a freddie.
  1014: I had to dress up like WILMA last night, fer Chrissakes.
  1015: I was with Myron last night. For about five seconds.
  1016: Looking to pop a clip?
  1017: Wish they'd come out with some Jet-smelling body oils...
  1018: Want to help a virgin lose her virginity?
  1019: My ass is going to fall off, Myron keeps it up.
  1020: Damn Temperance Union came around again…
  1021: You make my Geiger counter tick.
  1022: "::Whistles::"
  1023: Biting is extra.
  1024: I guarantee I'm better than that Pip Boy attachment you've been using.
  1025: Want me to tighten your screws?
  1026: I'd rather be with Avellone.
  1027: I wish Nick Kesting was here. We could talk for hours!
  1028: Nick Kesting is a really nice guy. We have great conversations.
  1029: Tommy the Balls is sooo dreamy.
  1030: I need fifty dollars to make you holler.
  1031: My name's Easy, slaver-girl. What's yours?
  1032: Need someone to yank your leash, slaver-girl?
  1033: Why don't you take me back to your cage, slaver-girl?
  1034: Hey, slaver. Looking for the other woman?
  1035: Looking for a taste of the other side, sweetheart?
  1036: Need your cage rattled, slaver-girl?
  1037: Feeling experimental, slaver-girl? Prove it.
  1038: Wanna take a walk on the wild side, slaver-girl?
  1039: Need someone to share your tent, slaver-girl?
  1040: Need someone to share your bedroll, slaver-girl?
  1041: Got some nice curves there, slaver-girl.
  1042: Wanna dance, slaver-girl?
  1043: Slaver-girl, you ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  1044: My job? I turn boys into *men.* I don't really know what I turn women into,
    but I'd like to find out.
  1045: Lose your way, slaver-girl?
  1046: Looking for a good time, slaver-girl?
  1047: Need a date, slaver-girl?
  1048: Where's the fire, slaver-girl?
  1049: You make my Geiger counter tick, slaver-girl.
  1050: My name's Easy. What's yours?
  1051: A little frisky, eh?
  1052: Did you bring your own towelette?
  1053: Yes, they ARE real.
  1054: Yes, they ARE real, and NO, you can't check.
  1055: Piss off, ass-for-brains.
  1056: Wanna wrangle, cowboy?
  1057: Wanna sink me with your pink torpedo?
  1058: Need someone to warm your tent?
  1059: Need someone to share your bedroll?
  1060: Got some hot-rocks there, pal.
  1061: Nasty little crotch cobra there.
  1062: Lookin' for some action?
  1063: You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  1064: Looking for a date?
  1065: Look, no free samples.
  1066: Heard there was some trouble on Commercial Row...
  1067: Looking for some company?
  1068: Only sports going on in Reno nowdays in tonsil hockey...
  1069: Wanna dance?
  1070: You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.
  1071: My job? I turn boys into MEN.
  1072: Can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?
  1073: Been walking this street since last night...
  1074: Need a friend for the evening? Or just ten minutes?
  1075: Wanna fly?
  1076: Haven't seen any caravans from Redding in a while...
  1077: Nice dill.
  1078: Lose your way, cowboy?
  1079: Got a gun you need to unload, soldier?
  1080: Anything I can help you with, stranger?
  1081: Looking for a good time?
  1082: Looking to go down-town?
  1083: I like the look of your gecko.
  1084: That a gecko in your pocket?
  1085: You need a guide around town, sugah?
  1086: Where's the fire?
  1087: You got the money, I got the time.
  1088: Childe, let me make you a man.
  1089: Oh, hello, Mr. Tyler. Going…down?
  1090: If I have to talk to you afterwards, that's extra.
  1091: This one guy, Fred Hatch, he wanted to know if there were any "big girls"
    in town. Weird.
  1092: Your friend with the bone in his nose…great gimmick.
  1093: Does your friend with the bone do tricks with his nose or sumthin'?
  1094: Maybe I should put a bone in my nose. Might attract more female customers.
  1095: That fella's got a bone in his nose the size of my arm. Keeee-rist.
  1096: I don't even want to know how that boy got that bone in his nose.
  1097: Is your friend with the bone in his nose in the business?
  1098: How much does your friend with the bone in his nose charge?
  1099: For thirty chips, I can make that bone in your friend's nose larger.
  1100: Your friend with the bone in his nose over-compensating for something?
  1101: Looking for the Garden of Eden? Come to my bedroom.
  1102: Lookin' for some action?
  1103: When in doubt, whip it out.
  1104: Let me teach you some things only a woman can teach.
  1105: I finally installed that padded headboard.
  1106: Taste of paradise'll cost you ten chips.
  1107: 'Myron: All wax. No wick.'
  1108: Myron's a real twister.
  1109: AC-DC, B n' D, whatever.
  1110: That Bishop girl is a bed-bunny.
  1111: She ain't no Jet reliant, she's a BONE reliant.
  1112: I heard Vault City has only two types of Citizens. Maybe it was some cloning
    accident.
  1113: Felt like I was in a marathon last night...
  1114: Looking for love, honey?
  1115: No kissing. It's the rule.
  1116: Wish Myron would move away. Far away.
  1117: I can do ANYTHING you want...for the right price.
  1118: I'm ready to go, honey. How about you?
  1119: Forget the slot machines. My payoff's MUCH better.
  1120: I hate teabags.
  1121: Take a gamble on me, honey.
  1122: Looking for a good time?
  1123: I can't believe how many strippers were at Feargus' bachelor party.
  1124: Pure Reno love, right here.
  1125: I'll give you some play.
  1126: I'm Filthy Spice.
  1127: I'm Homely Spice.
  1128: I'm Old Spice.
  1129: I'm Slutty Spice.
  1130: I'm Syphilis…er, Slutty Spice.
  1131: I'm Dirty Spice.
  1132: I've got a girlfriend if you want a double-header.
  1133: Wish Myron was gay.
  1134: Still don't know why they call it Virgin Street…
  1135: I wish he'd wear a paper bag sometimes.
  1136: Buy me a drink?
  1137: Take a lonely lady on the town?
  1138: Uh, of course I'm a woman. Just ignore the Adam's apple.
  1139: I heard some of the girls uptown killed their pimp.
  1140: Helloooo, stranger.
  1141: That Jules better leave me alone.
  1142: Still got that bruise from the headboard…
  1143: Been worn out ever since that last convention…
  1144: I wish Gen Con took place in some other town.
  1145: You could melt metal, you know that?
  1146: I felt the Earth move, but it was just the chili.
  1147: Make me melt.
  1148: I'm a virgin. I'm just not very good at it.
  1149: Need a guide around town?
  1150: "*Whoa.* That'll cost extra."
  1151: Jules keeps wanting freebies.
  1152: I hear the families are getting tense again.
  1153: Things are pretty slow. I wish that caravan would show.
  1154: So he dresses up in this Deathclaw costume, then…
  1155: I need help getting out of this dress.
  1156: Zip me up? Then down again?
  1157: Sorry, what were you saying? I was too busy staring at your ass.
  1158: Wanna waste some time?
  1159: I kicked Jules in his family jewels last week.
  1160: They don't call me Lady Lucky for nothing.
  1161: Of *course* I love those brahmin-flavored condoms. Yum.
  1162: Show a lady a good time?
  1163: Wish they would invent a sexual placebo for Myron.
  1164: Need a date, tribal?
  1165: Want to pow-wow, tribal?
  1166: Want to do the rain dance in my bedroom, tribal?
  1167: All you need is one night with me.
  1168: Looking for the Garden of Eden? Come to my bedroom.
  1169: Can you help me? I'm looking for my lost virginity.
  1170: I'm a virgin, but I need the money.
  1171: Be gentle, it's my first time. Today.
  1172: Me so horny.
  1173: You got the craving, I got the saving.
  1174: Let me awaken your inner child.
  1175: I'm just doing this to pay for college.

  270: Me? Oh, I'm just jolly Saint Nick, you cranially challenged half-wit.
  271: |-
    Me? I'm jolly Saint Nick. And YOU must be that stupid thug-for-hire that's been roaming around town like a
     starved dog hungry for its own excrement.

    Me? I'm jolly ol' Saint Nick. And YOU must be that stupid piece of tailchasing porno trash that's hung like

  275: Saint Nick? Who the hell is that?
  276: Look grandpa, one more comment like that, and I'll be wearing your teeth as
    a necklace.

  278: Impressive vocabulary…"Nick." You from around here?
  279: Forget this. I'm out of here.
  290: |-
    (Glares at you, then snorts.) Name's Renesco. Just tell me what it is you want, you…well, whatever it is you are.
     (Squints at you.) You look like one of those sun-worshipping primates under all that get-up.
  291: I'm from a village to the northwest. Arroyo.
  292: What do you sell here?
  293: |-
    What do I WANT? I don't really know. Most of the time I ignore my quest and walk into the homes of others,
     riffling through people's shelves...oooh, like those over there!
  294: You have an interesting vocabulary…Renesco. Are you from around here?
  295: I'm outta here.

    I sell recreational chems mostly. That's why they gave me that idiotic appellation, 'the Rocketman.' Hmmmph. I
     also sell some caravan supplies. You NEED anything or can I get back to something important?
  306: |-
    Rocketman, huh? Know the line in that Elton John song, "Rocketman, burning off the mmmncfnfm there at home?' What's
     he really saying there?
  307: Can I see what you have in stock?
  308: You sell chems here in the STORE?
  309: You mean like selling chems to Wright's son?
  310: Go on back to what you were doing.
  320: "(Renesco glares at you. It looks like he is undressing you mentally, then
    tearing you limb from limb.)"
  321: Nevermind, then. I had some other questions…
  322: Nevermind, then.
  330: |-
    (Renesco looks at you in disgust.) Yes. In the STORE. This isn't the 20th century where chems are sold by
     street corner cockroaches who live in constant fear of the authorities.
  331: Well, then -
  332: But -
  333: Uh, I think I better -
  350: |-
    This is NEW RENO. There are no cops, no law, and there's plenty of customers who don't mind buying poison at the
     pharmacy down the street. Does THAT answer your question, primate?
  351: 'All except one: Was Richard Wright one of your customers?'
  352: All right, all right...what have you got in stock?
  353: Actually, I had some more questions...
  354: But, like you said, the chems are…poisonous. They kill the spirit. Doesn't
    it bother you to sell them?
  355: Sure does. I'll be going now.
  365: |-
    Does it BOTHER me to sell them to idiots, slavers, crime lords and tribals that the world would be better off
     without? Primate, three words: get out more.
  366: OK...can I see what you have in stock?
  367: All right, all right. Look, I had some other questions...
  368: The chems here in New Reno are finding their way to other places, and hurting
    people there. Doesn't that concern you?
  369: I'll start by leaving right now.
  375: So? What do I care about them?
  377: |-
    The human race suffered a horrible tragedy. Now we are trying to rebuild. Selling Jet seems…counterproductive
     to that reconstruction.
  378: Well, whatever. I must be going now.
  385: |-
    So. What. No one is FORCING those idiots to inhale Jet. No one's going around and jamming it down their
     throats!
  386: Can I see -
  387: But don't -
  388: That is your -
  395: |-
    Those lamphead rock humpers in Redding KNOW what they're taking, so I don't feel a millimeter of pity for 'em!
     Far as I'm concerned, Jet weeds out the human trash that shoulda died when the bombs dropped!
  396: Uh, okay. Can I see your stock?
  397: Where is this Redding you speak of? Why do you mention them?
  398: You mentioned Redding specifically. Why is Jet so prevalent in Redding?
  400: That is your right to feel that way. I must be going now.
  410: |-
    Well, Redding's a…special case. See, there's people in Reno who make sure Redding's well-supplied. After all, you
     taste Jet once, you're hooked. It's how I make MY living.
  411: Speaking of which, can I see your stock?
  412: Who is making sure Redding is well-supplied? And why?
  413: So I noticed. Look, I had some other questions...
  414: I see…I must be going now.
  420: |-
    Well, tribal, I doubt you have the sense to notice this yet, but New Reno doesn't produce anything useful.
     It's like a big, brightly-lit prairie tick sitting out in the desert.  Now, Redding, on the other hand…
  421: Go on.
  422: "…DOES produce something useful."
  423: I've heard enough.
  430: |-
    First and last time I'm gonna warn you, tribal: Don't finish my goddamn sentences. I don't like smartass primates
     that talk when they should listen. No wonder you all still use spears…
  431: Not all of us. For example, I use a variety of weapons to kill people...let
    me show you.
  432: Forgive me. Please go on.
  433: 'Burn in hell. I''m outta here. '
  440: |-
    Redding has a stable work force that mines raw materials, mostly gold. New Reno sure could use that gold. Somebody
     figures all we gotta do is get those miners hooked, and we got 'em for life. You understand now?
  441: 'Yes…except for one thing: Where did Jet come from?'
  442: Who's trying to hook all the miners?
  443: Yeah, I understand. Look, I had some other questions...
  444: I don't want to hear anymore. I must be going now.
  450: |-
    (Points at Myron.) Why don't you ask your little horny toad friend there? I'm sure he'd be happy to tell you. (Glares
     at Myron.) Right, kid?
  451: |-
    We have one person to thank for Jet. You heard of Family Mordino's little golden boy, Myron? Well, the little
     bastard CREATED Jet. Big Jesus Mordino just let everyone know where they could get it.
  452: Tell me more about Myron.
  453: Is there any cure for Jet?
  454: I had some other questions...
  460: |-
    Big Jesus Mordino's funneling Jet into Redding. Typical power play. Once the pipeline really gets going, those
     miners are goners.
  461: Where did Jet come from?
  463: I see. Look, I had some other questions...
  470: |-
    Horny as a toad and all the morals of one. Smart kid, though. High IQ. Wasting his brains manufacturing chems, that's
     for damn certain.
  471: Where can I find him?
  472: I see. I had some other questions…
  480: The Mordinos' got him locked up somewhere. Heavily-guarded, probably. Don't
    know exactly where.
  481: Thanks for the information. Can I see what you have in stock?
  490: |-
    A CURE for metamphetamine reliance?! Ha! I only know two: one is death. The other is locking yourself
     in a cage for a year without Jet and sweat it out of your system. Hmmmph. "Cure," my ass! What nonsense!
  492: There must be a cure. What's Jet's chemical composition?
  505: Why don't you ask your friend there? He designed the chem.
  506: I just sell the stuff. I'd ask a scientist. Or Myron. He designed the chem.
  515: "(Renesco glares at you in silence.)"
  516: "(Renesco glares at you again, this time in silence.)"
  517: |-
    I think you'd like Arroyo. It's a peaceful village. Except for the plants possessed by evil spirits…and of course, the temple
     of trials filled with those deadly spear traps and the man-eating giant ants.
  518: Hey, you ever heard of a Garden of Eden Creation Kit? Or Vault 13?
  519: Okay, then…I'm out of here.
  525: "(Renesco continues to glare at you.)"
  526: |-
    And sometimes the elder gets upset at little things, like…heh-heh…that one night when I ignored my vow of
     celibacy and snuck out with Reyna - Whose - Legs - Crush - With - Strength - of - Thousand - Snakes to the Arroyo canyon…

    And sometimes the elder gets upset at little things, like…heh-heh…that one night when I ignored my vow of

  535: "(Renesco gives you a withering stare.)"
  536: |-
    It was like yesterday. Reyna's body glowed like silver in the moonlight when she knelt down and…hey, you know what?
     You might like the elder. She's about your age.
  1536: |-
    It was like yesterday. Kor's body rippled like bronze in the moonlight as I knelt down and…hey, you know what?
     You might like the elder. She's about your age.
  545: "(Renesco continues to glare at you as if he could somehow make you disappear
    just by imagining it hard enough.)"
  546: |-
    Did I mention Arroyo was founded by my ancestor, the holy Vault Dweller? He made a legendary journey from the
     south after defeating a great evil. (Puff up chest and stare proudly into the distance.) Now, *I* am the deliverer of my
     tribe, chosen to search for the holy GECK!
  547: Okay, then, enough stories…I better be on my way. Praise the Vault!
  555: "(Renesco's glare crumbles.) "
  556: |-
    GECK? As in 'Garden of Eden Creation Kit?' Comes with a basic replicator unit, holodisc reader with selections
     from the library of congress, and a little pen flashlight?
  557: Yes, but that's not important right now. I haven't finished telling you about
    Arroyo.
  558: Yes! My village is having trouble with crops, and the GECK is needed to restore
    them. Do you know where I can find one?
  559: It is said to be sealed within Vault 13, or so the legends say. Do you know
    of such a place?
  560: If you're not going to LISTEN when I recite the holy scriptures, I'm out of
    here.
  561: Could be. Look, I have to go.
  570: |-
    Your backwater herb-smoking village be damned, and you along with it. Why is
     a primate like you looking for a GECK?
  571: |-
    Arroyo…my backwater herb-smoking village, as you say…is having trouble with its crops. The GECK is needed
     to restore them.
  572: It is said to be sealed within Vault 13. Do you know of such a place?
  573: I don't think I feel like sharing that at the moment. Goodbye.
  580: |-
    Hmmmmm. It sure could do that…easy. IF you could find one. Don't even know where you'd start looking. NCR
     or Vault City, maybe, but I doubt they'd have one…still…
  581: Still…?
  590: Still, those self-righteous bastards might be able to point you in a direction.
    If they speak slowly and use small words…
  591: NCR or Vault City you say? I will go in search of these places and ask their
    villagers about the GECK. Thank you.
  592: Why would the GECK not be in sacred Vault 13? The scriptures SAY that the GECK
    is sealed within the sacred Vault 13.
  593: Very funny. I had some other questions…
  594: Okay, then…I'll go check it out. Thanks.
  600: |-
    Hell no, primate. I've heard of vaults, sure, but not Vault 13. Closest thing is Vault City to the northeast…and
     if those aristocratic jackanapes inhabited a Vault once, they sure as hell don't live there no more.
  601: "Vault City, you say? I will go in search of this Vault city and ask their
    villagers about the GECK.\n Thank you, Renesco. Praise the Vault! "
  602: '"Vaults?" There is more than one Vault?'
  603: Hmmm. I had some other questions…
  610: |-
    If you're going to Vault City, don't thank me, primate. You're better off in New Reno. At least the people
     sizing you up for a coffin are honest about it.
  611: 'Okay, then…I''m on my way to Vault City. Praise the Vault! '
  612: 'I see. Thanks for the warning. '
  620: |-
    Why do you think it's called Vault THIRTEEN, spearchucker? What, was your tribe short on brains or do you just
     perform ritual lobotomies to cleanse the tiny voice of reason that speaks in your head?
  623: 'Yeah, there you go sugar-talking me again. Thanks…for the info, at least. '
  630: A person's past ain't a smart topic of conversation here in New Reno. Now,
    what is you want?
  632: You sound like an educated man. Have you ever heard of a GECK or a place called
    Vault 13?
  634: 'Nothing, nevermind. '
  640: |-
    (Renesco snatches the glasses from you and puts them on. His eyes widen.) Sweet Reno! THAT'S what this damn
     shop looks like. (Frowns.) What a mess…and what is that on the shelves? Looks like brahmin shit.
  641: You're welcome…
  642: 'Enjoy. '
  650: Hmpphh! I…hmmm…uh…where did you get these?
  651: |-
    Well, there was this tiny radscorpion, see, and there was this scientist that was training him, and...you know what? Even I
     don't believe it. Just keep them, all right?
  652: Let's just say I found them. Somewhere.
  660: Hey! Waitaminute! Where did you get these?
  661: |-
    Well, there was this tiny radscorpion, see, and there was this scientist that was training him, and...you know what? Even I
     don't believe it. Just keep them, all right?
  670: |-
    Well, I…hmnnn…I'm…eh, grateful. I thought I was going to have to suffer with those broken frames for the
     rest of my life. If I can do something for you, you let me know…and, uh, I'll THINK about it.
  671: How about a discount?
  672: Nevermind…look, just wear them in good health, okay? I had some other questions…
  673: "Someday - and that day may never come - I'll call upon you to do a service
    for me. But until that day\n accept these glasses as a gift on my daughter's wedding
    day. "
  680: Ehhh…
  681: Errr….
  682: Well…
  683: Okay! Okay! I'll give you a discount! Hmphhh.
  684: C'mon. Just a little discount. C'mon…
  687: Great! Let's see what you've got, "buddy."
  688: Excellent! Say, I had some other questions…
  689: 'I''ll be back to shop later. '
  700: Make it quick.
  701: Look, I'm a busy man…
  702: Well? Out with it already!
  703: Yeah?
  704: Did I ever tell you about my village Arroyo?
  706: Did you sell Jet to Richard Wright?
  707: I've come to collect Mr. Salvatore's tribute.
  710: I'm looking for some mine parts for Broken Hills…
  711: You have an interesting vocabulary…are you from around here?
  712: 'Nevermind. '
  725: "(Eyes narrow.) So?"
  726: Well, I need the parts to fix the air purifier in their mine. I was told you
    could help me.
  727: Well, I need the parts to fix the air purifier in their mine. Zaius sent me.
    He said, uh…said...uh...shit.
  728: Well, I need the parts to fix the air purifier in their mine. Zaius sent me.
    He said, 'The canary's kicked the bucket.'
  735: Yes, I do happen to have some parts that could fix the air purifier. 100 bucks.
  736: I'll take it. Here you go.
  737: How about fifty bucks?
  738: 'Uh, I don''t have a hundred on me…I''ll be back later with the cash. '
  745: Inflation due to managerial irritation with hagglers. 200 or nothing.
  746: "(Frowns.) 200 or nothing."
  747: Two hundred?! You said a HUNDRED a second ago!
  748: Uh, I'll take it. Here you go.
  749: 'Uh, I don''t have two hundred on me…I''ll be back later with the cash. '
  755: I STRONGLY doubt that is what he said.  It wasn't 'The canary's kicked the
    bucket,' was it?
  756: Well, yes.
  760: And…?
  761: '"And?"'
  765: And the SECOND part was…?
  766: '"Second part?" He didn''t say anything about a SECOND part. That low-down
    bast -!'
  769: 'Just testing you. There is no second part. Well, if Zaius sent you, I SUPPOSE
    I have some parts to spare. '
  770: Here you go. Don't drop them.
  771: Thanks. I had some other questions…
  772: 'Uh, thanks. '
  780: |-
    Don't you even TRY and pin that accusation on me. You want to know who did it, ask Tweedledum and Tweedledumber
     if they're still selling Jet laced with arsenic.
  781: "'Tweedledum' and 'Tweedledumber?' Who are they?"
  782: Jules said to ask you. He says you sell bad shit.
  783: Jagged Jimmy said to ask you. He says you sell bad shit.
  784: They both said to ask YOU about it. They say you sell bad shit.
  785: I don't think it was arsenic...I DO think he was poisoned, though.
  786: Can you tell me anything about this empty Jet canister?
  788: 'I''ll go ask them then. '
  795: |-
    That vulture Jules and that lying reprobate 'Jagged Jimmy.' Jules is always perched near the entrance
     to town looking for ignorant visitors to victimize, and Jagged Jimmy deals on 2nd Street to the rest of the Reno cattle.
  798: They said to ask you. They say you sell bad shit. Shit that kills people.
  800: 'I''ll go talk to them then. '
  805: Look, primate…you don't even KNOW what you're babbling about.
  806: Oh, I think I -
  807: Yeah? Well then, why don't -
  808: Nevermind. I had some other qu -
  809: Look I better be go -
  815: |-
    OPEN your mouth again and even a WHISPER, even a HINT, reaches Mr. Wright that I…or you…might've had anything
     to do that boy's OD, our lives ain't worth Brahmin shit. If THAT happens --
  816: Oh? So you -
  817: Me?! Now hold on just a -
  825: |-
    If THAT happens, you tribal SHIT, I SWEAR you'll die before I do. Now…for the LAST time, that kid never bought SHIT
     from me, understand? Don't you EVER say his name in here again, or so help me…
  826: |-
    JULES says he didn't sell to the kid. JIMMY says he didn't sell to the kid. YOU say you didn't sell to him. One
     of you is lying.
  827: |-
    JULES says he didn't sell to the kid. JIMMY says he didn't sell to the kid. YOU say you didn't sell to him. Either
     you all are lying, or...somebody else is responsible.
  828: Can you tell me anything else about Richard Wright? Who did he hang around
    who might have used chems?
  829: All right...look, I had some other questions...
  830: 'Okay, okay...I''m going now. '
  835: |-
    I can answer that easy. One of those two mongrels is lying to save their behind. Between the two, they
     sell 90% of the Jet in Reno, and that's the only place the 'boy' we're talking about could've gotten it from.
  836: |-
    Or somebody that bought from one of you three. Who were your customers last month who might have had contact
     with…the victim?
  837: Can you tell me anything else about Richard Wright? Did he hang around anyone
    else who might have used chems?
  838: I see...I had some other questions...
  839: 'I''m going now. '
  845: 'You STUPID bastard. '
  846: 'You STUPID bitch. '
  847: |-
    I TOLD you not to say his name in here. Get out! I see you again, I'll SHOOT YOU DEAD. If Mr. Wright comes looking
     for me, thinks I killed his boy, YOU'LL die first.
  848: Don't threaten me, old man…
  849: 'Whoa. I''m going now. '
  855: |-
    I have NO idea. I didn't know the boy, so I don't know his friends OR his habits. The only one who could tell
     you for sure is too busy being dead in Golgotha to tell you.
  856: Golgotha?
  858: 'Maybe I''ll do that. Goodbye. '
  865: |-
    Then you wasted a trip. I PAID Mr. Salvatore his 'tribute' *two weeks ago,* as per the schedule. I don't know
     who you are, or what you think you're doing, but you aren't getting one red chip from me. Get.
  866: Look, gramps. Stop giving me a hard time. Cough up the chips, or you'll be
    coughing up blood.
  867: I am Mr. Salvatore's representative. You will give me the tribute I have asked
    for, and you will do so now.
  868: 'I''ll check with Mr. Salvatore about the schedule, then I''ll be back. '
  875: 'You lose your hearing, boy? '
  876: 'You lose your hearing, girl? '
  877: I SAID I. PAID. THE. TRIBUTE. ALREADY. *Two weeks ago.* If you were really
    from Salvatore, you would know that. Now git!
  878: 'Look. Last time: Hand over the chips.'
  879: You are the one who has lost your hearing. I am Mr. Salvatore's representative,
    and you will pay the tribute.
  880: I warned you, gramps. Looks like we'll be doing this the hard way. Time to
    die.
  881: 'I''ll check with Mr. Salvatore about the tribute, then I''ll be back. '
  890: Prove you're from Salvatore, and I'll CONSIDER giving you the chips. Else,
    you aren't getting shit.
  891: I do not need to prove myself. I am his representative, and that is all you
    need to know.
  892: What, you think this laser pistol is just for show?
  893: If you do not give me the tribute in five seconds, I WILL kill you.
  900: Get the hell out of here, you penny-ante thug! You so much as show your face
    in here again, and I'll shoot you myself!
  901: I warned you. Time to die.
  910: Hmmmph. Don't matter, I can't pay. The last collection nearly wiped me out.
  911: That is not my concern. You will get me the money now. Mr. Salvatore does not
    want to hear your excuses.
  920: |-
    Threatening me ain't gonna help. Mr. Salvatore wants his money. I don't have it. He'll be mad at me, but he'll
     be mad at you, too. Salvatore doesn't LIKE people who let him down…you better figure out something quick.
  921: I already have. I will pay your share for this period. In exchange, you will
    give me a discount at your store.
  924: I'll try and figure something out…I'll be back.
  930: Now hold on, you neanderthal…
  931: I will not argue with you anymore. My patience is at an end. Those are my terms.
  940: I...look, now, I...hmmmm...all right, then. You get a…"discount."
  941: Let me see your stock. I will make my 'purchases' now.
  943: 'I don''t want anything now, but don''t worry, I''ll be back. '
  950: |-
    (Folds arms.) Adequate. If you are expecting some handout for being a good samaritan, you are GRAVELY
     mistaken. Now…what do you want?
  951: |-
    Goddamn whatever Deathclaw or marketing director spawned you! You WANT something?! Here! HERE! Take THIS!
     Take ALL I have! Anything to get you to LEAVE ME ALONE!
  952: Let me see your stock.
  953: I had some questions…
  955: 'What the hell IS this…? '
  960: Poisoned? What are you babbling about?
  961: |-
    The body's condition was consistent with Radscorpion poisoning. I think he died because his Jet was poisoned,
     NOT because of an overdose.
  962: I found an empty Jet canister in his room. It had traces of Radscorpion venom
    in it.
  963: Nevermind. I had some other questions...
  964: 'Forget it. I have to be going now. '
  970: Radscorpion...? (Renesco suddenly freezes, as if remembering something.)
  971: You son of a bitch. You *poisoned* the kid, didn't you?
  972: You know something about it, don't you?
  980: Whoa! Now wait just a minute...!
  981: Don't mess with me, Renesco! You try and weasel out of this one, and you'll
    be joining Richard. Understand?
  982: That's it. Me and Mr. Wright are going to have a little talk. Good day, Renesco...or
    should I say, "goodbye."
  990: |-
    Wait a minute! Look...I didn't SELL it to the kid! He never bought ANYTHING from me! I...was ASKED
     to make some Jet laced with radscorpion venom, but...but I DIDN'T sell it to the kid!
  991: You were ASKED to make poisoned Jet? For who?
  992: Who DID you sell it to?
  995: |-
    The Salvatores requested it -- they said it was a..."special order." I didn't know they were going to give
     it to the Wright kid. You HAVE to believe me...I don't poison kids!
  996: Just adults, huh, Renesco? You sorry son of a bitch...
  997: WHY did you poison the Jet?  You had to know they were going to kill someone
    with it.
  998: All right, all right, I believe you. I had some other questions...
  999: Just shut up. Look, I had some other questions...
  1000: 'The Salvatores, huh? I think Mr. Wright will want to know about this. '
  1005: |-
    The Salvatores OWN me, they OWN this place, and when they want something, I give it to them, or they'll kill
     me and have me replaced. I never meant any harm to that boy.
  1007: Just shut up. Look, I had some other questions for you...
  1008: Yeah, I'm sure you had the best of intentions while you were spiking that
    Jet with poison. Goodbye, Renesco.
  1009: 'Later, Renesco. '
  1020: It's empty. It's a Jet canister like the hundreds of others all over New Reno.
    Anything else I can help you with?
  1021: Does this belong to you?
  1022: Know anything about the radscorpion venom traces that are in this canister?
  1023: Yeah, I had some other questions...
  1030: No. Anything ELSE I can help you with?
  1033: 'No. Goodbye. '
  1040: Golgotha? Mass graveyard outside of town to the south. Follow the stench...the
    one OTHER than your own.
  1041: Oh. I had some other questions...
  1042: 'You keep sweet-talking me like that, Renesco, and you''ll be a long time
    dying. '
  1043: 'THANKS, Renesco. '
  2000: You have exposed Renesco's involvement in Richard Wright's death.
  5257: " is so big. Me go now "
  5259: " no shout WHY YOU KEEP SHOUTING BE STOPPING THE SHOUTING "
  6259: " KILL YOU"

ncResear:
  100: You see the lead researcher, Marjorie Reed.
  150: You see a tired-looking woman. Her head has been shaved bald, and she is wearing
    a white coat.
  151: You see Marjorie Reed. She is filling a hypodermic, grumbling slightly to herself.
  200: Hello, Myron.
  201: Myron, do you have a minute…?
  202: Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, Myron?
  203: Myron, these new results are very promising…
  204: Myron, a minute of your time?
  215: Where the hell is Myron…
  216: Get Myron up here. He has to see this.
  217: Wish these slaves would shut up…
  218: Where did I leave that syringe…
  219: Has anyone seen No. 31? He was here just a second ago.
  220: Have the slaves bring more of the Jet Beta.
  221: Test results from Jet Beta are very promising, but…
  222: '"High" lasts 15 min to an hour…calculate one dose/hour period…hmmmmnnn.'
  223: No. 12 still keeps having nasal bleeding…
  224: That's the fifth time No. 12 has had seizures…up the dose, see what happens…
  225: Well, what SORT of hallucinations was he having?
  226: Check that one's heart rate. If it's still within tolerable limits, up the
    dosage.
  227: Why did the slave in the control group kill herself? We weren't even testing
    her!
  228: Damn guards can keep track of their own asses…
  235: Hello, Myron, sir. Tests are proceeding as scheduled.
  236: Myron, sir, this new strain of Jet is extremely habit-forming. The slaves are
    almost willing to kill each other for it.
  237: Myron, sir, you'll be pleased to note that the slaves would rather take Jet
    than eat, it's so potent.
  238: Who are these people with you, Myron? New subjects?
  239: Myron, sir, the third test group seem to be doing the best of all the groups.
  240: Myron, sir, if you have a moment...I think the next test group should include
    at least three children, sir.
  241: Myron, sir, No. 46 had a heart attack; we are restricting doses to six times
    a day from now on.
  242: Myron, sir, please...we need a new shipment of hypodermics from Vault City.
    We can't keep re-using these.
  243: Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, Myron, sir?
  244: Myron, sir, we moved three slaves from the control group into the test group
    because of those respiratory failures we had last week.
  245: Myron, bad news, sir. We had to shoot one slave for trying to escape. What
    a waste.
  246: Myron, this new hallucinogen you've developed is promising, but it is not as
    habit-forming as jet…
  250: "(The bald woman doesn't even look up from her clipboard.) Yes?"
  251: No!
  252: Yes!
  253: Heh-heh. You bald. You look like man
  254: Delenn?
  255: Wander off
  256: Who are you?
  257: Sorry, I thought you were some other bald woman with a clipboard. I'll be going
    now.
  265: "(The woman looks up and glares at you.) Are you one of the control subjects?
    As if matters anyway...Guards! Detain this slave!"
  266: Where slave? Me no see one
  275: Look, I'm VERY busy, so if you don't mind… [Glances up from her clipboard at
    you, then scowls.] WHO are you? How did you get in here?
  276: Look, I'm VERY busy, so if you don't mind… [Glances up from her clipboard at
    you, then scowls.] You again? What do you want now?
  277: Your barn door's open. Heh-heh…get it? I kill me.
  278: I'm one of the new personnel assigned here.
  279: I'm looking for Myron. Is he around?
  280: Are those test results you have on that clipboard? Can I see them?
  282: Nevermind. Sorry to bother you.
  295: This area is not open for…visitors. Leave or I will call the guards.
  296: But hey, I had some questions for you…
  298: Are those test results you have on that clipboard? Can I see them? I'm something
    of a researcher myself.
  300: Very well. Sorry to bother you.
  310: Guards! Guards, detain this person!
  315: |-
    MORE guards. Ha! As if they do any good…look, you SHOULD have received instructions from whoever sent you here. Talk
     to the other guards to find out your assignment. Now go.
  316: I'm not a guard; I'm one of the new researchers. Do you have an assignment
    for me?
  317: |-
    Excuse me, but I was hoping YOU could show me around. I saw you standing over here and
     felt COMPELLED to talk to you. Perhaps after the tour we could have dinner…?
  318: Thanks. You've been very helpful.
  325: You're a RESEARCHER...? Hmmmm. I've never seen you before. How much do you
    know about pharmaceutical research?
  326: Uh, enough. Just sit back and watch me go.
  327: |-
    I know a fair amount about the composition and manufacture of base neurochemical compounds, and I think I
     could be of some assistance in your studies.
  328: I have to be going.
  335: Ha! I think I'll just watch you go, period. Leave before I call the guards.
  336: All right.
  337: I'm going…::mumble::…you bald-headed bitch.
  345: |-
    Hmmmm. All right then. Let me give you a run-down on what we do here: we test the effects and potency of a metamphetamine
     called Jet.
  346: I see. And how is the research coming?
  347: I think I have the idea. I'll examine the rest of the testing area myself.
  355: Not so well. Our schedule is tight, and we need to purify the Jet manufacturing
    process soon.
  356: Why? Jet seems habit-forming enough already.
  357: Why the tight schedule?
  358: Sounds like a tough job. Look, I have to take care of something real quick
    - I'll be back.
  365: |-
    No one's come out and said it, but it's probably due to Jet distribution in Redding. Jet's potent *enough,* but
     there's a good deal of room for improvement, and the 'brass' wants to increase Jet reliance in Redding.
  366: What's the deal with Redding?
  367: Well, good luck meeting the schedule.
  375: |-
    It's potent *enough,* but there's room for improvement. The 'brass' wants to increase Jet distribution in
     Redding, and they want the reliance rate as close to 100% as we can get it. It's going to require us pulling some long hours.
  377: Thanks for the information. I'll be back later.
  385: Hook the miners in Redding to Jet, and whoever controls the Jet, controls Redding.
    Typical power play.
  386: So…who does control the chems?
  395: |-
    Who controls the chems? The Mordinos. Of course, Myron laid all the groundwork for Jet's composition.
     We do mostly clean-up work.
  396: Is Myron your boss?
  405: |-
    You COULD call it that. He's a smart one, I'll give him that, but he doesn't care much about what goes
     on up here. He mostly stays in the basement vault…no visitors except for the train of prostitutes. Typical project leader.
  406: Could I see him?
  407: Yeah, though marketing's worse. Anyway, thanks for the information. I'll be
    back later.
  415: |-
    I suppose…let me give you a temporary badge; just show it to the guards. Keep it quick, though, Myron doesn't
     like people staying long.
  416: |-
    I suppose…let me give you a temporary badge; just show it to the guards. Keep it quick, though, Myron doesn't
     like people staying long…though he may make an exception in your case.
  417: Thanks for the badge. I'll see you later.
  425: Look, I'm VERY busy, so if you don't mind…
  426: Look, I…I'm, uh, very busy, so if you would please excuse me…
  427: Nevermind then...
  428: Thanks anyway.
  429: 'Thanks anyway...::mumble:: …you uppity cue-balled bitch.'
  435: This…hmm…I'm VERY flattered, but I'm also very busy at the moment…so…uh…
  436: |-
    Well, do you mind if I came by and picked you up after work then? No pressure…just some dinner, some
     conversation. You look like someone who might need to take a little break from work. Things here must keep you very busy.
  437: Well, I had to ask. Thanks anyway.
  445: |-
    Oh, not THAT busy…heh…well, no, pretty busy. I mean, mostly its routine chem testing, and occasionally we have
     a slave go over the edge…
  446: Doesn't purposely injecting experimental metamphetamines into enslaved humans
    make you question your basic humanity?
  447: Wow. That sounds dangerous. You ever get hurt? Do you have many patient fatalities?
  448: Chem testing? Really? How are things going?
  449: Sounds interesting, but I have to go….uh, I'll be back, though.
  455: Was that some poor attempt at a joke?
  456: Just asking. I mean, what if you had been sold into slavery, been taken here,
    then pumped full of chems?
  457: Uh, yes. I have to be going.
  465: |-
    I'm on THIS side of the stalls, they're on THAT side. Since we're getting into hypotheticals, would
     YOU like to find out what it's like to be them? We have an extra stall or two.
  466: Now hold on a minute…
  467: Uh, no thanks. Sorry to bother you.
  475: |-
    Slave deaths? A few. Mostly accidental overdoses - usually a tech's fault - or self-inflicted injuries.
     Some ingest too much Jet, and they REALLY want to fly.
  476: Other than that, how's the chem testing going?
  477: I bet. Well, thanks for the information. You've been very helpful.
  485: |-

  255: The Bishops talk big. Salvatores don't need to talk.
  256: All's quiet on the northern front.

  355: If you're looking to deal some slaves, talk to the boss.
  356: Don't think the boss is looking for any more slaves, but you might want to
    try him anyway.
  360: Looking for work? Talk to Mason.
  361: If you're looking for work, you should talk to Mason.
  365: Look, I ain't got the time. You want conversation, go to Virgin Street and
    talk to a whore.
  366: I haven't got time to talk right now.
  367: I can't help you.
  368: Can't help you. Sorry.
  369: Not now, sweetheart. Business.
  370: I'd chat, but the boss could be watching.
  371: Look, I ain't got the time for chit-chat.
  380: That ghoul better leave right NOW.
  381: If that ghoul's still here when I turn around, we'll burn it.
  382: That ghoul's asking to be a torch if it sticks around.
  1180: ". His name's gonna be corpse if he doesn't get out of here…"
  1185: ". Her name's gonna be corpse if she doesn't get out of here…"
  1278: ", but you better take it elsewhere."
  1279: ", but I'd take it somewhere else."

    You see Louis Salvatore. He is carrying an oxygen tank, and he seems

  202: "*Cough* *Cough*"
  210: Guards! Gu…*cough* *cough*…Guards!
  215: |-
    (Salvatore turns to you with a stone-faced expression. He studies you for a fraction
     of a second, then makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)
  216: Owwww! Turn down sound! Hurt ears! HURT EARS!
  217: ME CANT TALK OVER RINGING. TURN OFF, WE TALK
  218: I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!
  219: I knew I should have gotten permission first…
  220: Shit!
  221: Uh, please tell me that was room service.
  230: |-
    (The elderly man looks up at you. His face is gaunt and covered with liver spots. He is holding
     a breathing mask, which is connected to an oxygen tank by his side.) What… do you want of me?
  231: Me want…me no know what I want
  232: Me want
  233: 'Me '
  234: Wander off
  235: I have information for you.
  236: I have information for you, Mr. Salvatore.
  237: I'm looking for a job.
  238: Mr. Salvatore, you have a reputation for strength and fairness. I want to work
    for you.
  239: I wanted to know where you get the lightbringers.
  240: Word is you had Mr. Wright's son poisoned. Why?
  241: I think I've entered the wrong room. Pardon me.
  250: |-
    I have told you the reason the boy was killed. It will not leave this room. (Salvatore
     makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)

    (Salvatore studies you for a fraction of a second in disgust, then makes a strange motion with his hand.
     Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)
  254: I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!
  270: "(Takes a deep breath from his mask, then shakes his head.) You have\n nothing…that
    I need to know, "
  271: Um, I don't recall introducing myself. How do you know my name?
  272: Uh, okay. Well then, I'm looking for a job.
  276: Actually, I seem to have entered the wrong room. Pardon me.
  290: "(Looks at you silently for a minute. He might be either amused at your question\n
    or irritated…it's hard to tell.) Again, "
  291: Uh…hmmm. Well, uh, I'm looking for a job.
  305: |-
    (Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of…course you
     are. And WHY should I hire you?
  306: |-
    Well, why not? Name a job, I'll do it. I'm hard-working, and I got the skills to
     get things done.
  307: Whoa. Did I say I was looking for work? I meant to say I was leaving.
  315: |-
    (Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of…course. But
     I require a…token of your good faith. A sample of your…willingness to work for me.
  316: What do you want me to do?
  317: What would you have me do, Mr. Salvatore?
  325: |-
    (Shakes his head slightly.) Your naivetй has…no place here. Words are not
     sufficient: You wish to work for Louis Salvatore? Then I must know how much I can rely on you.
  326: Look, you can COUNT on me.
  327: Let me prove it, Mr. Salvatore. Assign me a task.
  335: |-
    (Takes a deep breath from the oxygen mask.) There is…a man…who
     has used his…skill with cards to rob me. The sum is...trivial. The insult is not. I want him killed and
     the money he stole returned.
  336: Who is this thief?
  338: How much has he stolen?
  339: 'It could be a rough assignment: Can I have one of those laser weapons your
    family uses?'
  340: Uh, I don't do contract hits. I'll be leaving now.
  350: Mason will have…the details. (Nods at exit.) Go now.
  351: All right.
  352: Thank you, Mr. Salvatore. I will go ask Mason.
  360: Then you are of…no use to me. Leave now.
  361: Uh, waitaminute…I changed my mind. I'll do it.
  362: Leave quietly.
  370: |-
    (Narrows his eyes. His next words are delivered in a rasping hiss.)
     ::You have not yet PROVEN yourself.:: Now go see Mason. He will have the…details of your assignment.
  371: All right, then. Forget the pistols for now.
  372: I understand, Mr. Salvatore. Forgive my question. I will go see Mason.
  373: 'Look: If you aren''t going to arm me properly, then I can''t continue working
    for you.'
  380: Talk to Mason. He will have the…details of your assignment.
  385: "(Salvatore looks up at you, takes a breath from the mask.) Have…you disposed
    of the thief?"
  386: Naw...Lloyd left town with the money.
  387: Yep. The vultures are probably shitting pieces of him out right now.
  388: Not yet.
  389: No, Mr. Salvatore. Lloyd left town with the money.
  390: Yes. I made an example of him, Mr. Salvatore.
  391: Not yet, Mr. Salvatore.
  400: Yet…you told Mason that you had taken care of the assignment.
  401: Well, yes, but…
  405: "(Puts his fingers together.) And…the money. Has it been recovered?"
  406: No, I couldn't find the money.
  407: No, Lloyd already spent the money.
  408: Yes.
  410: No, Mr. Salvatore, I couldn't find the money.
  411: No, Mr. Salvatore, Lloyd already spent the money.
  412: Yes, Mr. Salvatore.
  420: |-
    Your instructions were to recover the money he stole.
     Have you not done this?
  421: Well, no, because --
  422: Uh, I have the money --
  423: Well, you see, I don't --
  430: I will take the money now.
  431: Well, I don't have it on me…
  432: Give him 250 chips.
  433: Give him 500 chips.
  434: Give him 750 chips.
  435: Give him 1000 chips.
  436: Give him 1000 chips. (This is the correct amount.)
  437: "(Make a break for it.)"
  450: |-
    This amount…is not the amount that was stolen
     from me. Perhaps you don't know how much was stolen from me. Or perhaps you are holding
     out on me. Either way…
  451: Oh, well, I must have miscounted…
  455: |-
    (Salvatore nods as you give him the money, but he holds up his hands halfway
     through the transaction.) The…remaining half is yours.
  456: Hey, thanks.
  468: Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.
  475: "(Mr. Salvatore takes a breath from the mask.) I have another…matter that requires
    your attention."
  476: Sure, why not? What's the job -- another kill and fetch assignment?
  477: I am interested in the job, Mr. Salvatore. What do you want me to do?
  478: No, I'm done doing hit jobs. I'm making a clean break.
  479: No more jobs for me, Mr. Salvatore. I have to be going.
  485: |-
    A constituent in my…district has not paid me…tribute…for the services I provide.
     Collect it. If he objects, inform him you are my…representative in this matter. Talk to
     Mason for the details.
  487: Yes, Mr. Salvatore. I'll go see him.
  488: No thanks, I don't do extortion jobs.
  495: You are...lying to me. I know that he still lives.
  500: Have you done as I asked?
  501: Yes, Mr. Salvatore, I have the tribute you asked me to collect.
  502: Yeah, the 'tribute' is right here.
  503: Not yet. I haven't got the old guy to cough it up yet.
  504: Not yet, Mr. Salvatore. When I return, I shall have it with me.
  515: You told Mason you had collected my tribute. Have you not done this?
  525: Very well. (He waits.)
  527: Give him 900 chips.
  528: Give him 800 chips.
  529: Actually, I don't have the tribute ON me…
  540: |-
    This amount…is not the amount that was stolen
     from me. Perhaps you don't know how much the required tribute is. Or perhaps you are
     holding out on me. Either way…
  545: |-
    (Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done…well. You have
     earned 25% of the cut.
  546: |-
    (Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done…adequately. You have
     earned 10% of the cut.
  555: |-
    (Takes a breath from his mask.) You have...done as I asked. I have no
     further need of your… services. (Points to the exit.) Leave now.
  556: Uh…okay.
  557: Could I have one of those laser pistols as part of my payment before I go?
  565: |-
    (Takes a deep breath from the mask.) I have another…matter that I could
     use your assistance with.
  566: Sure, why not? What's the job - more extortion?
  568: No, I'm done doing extortion jobs. I'm making a clean break.
  575: |-
    A…sensitive transaction will be taking place soon. I am in need of an extra… guard
     to insure that the transaction goes smoothly. You will speak with Mason and do as he directs you.
  576: What is this transaction?
  577: Where is this transaction taking place?
  578: Can I have one of those laser weapons you use?
  579: I can't do this mission right now, Mr. Salvatore. I must be going.
  585: Mason will have…the details. Go now.
  595: |-
    Yesss. This time, yes. But you will
     carry other armaments as well. Talk to Mason about the details. He will give you
     one of the lightbringers.
  596: All right, then.
  605: 'Sit, '
  607: I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore.
  608: I can't. I have other obligations. Thanks for the offer, though.
  610: |-
    I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore, but I cannot. I have other duties to another
     family… notably, my mother.
  615: "That is... unfortunate. I cannot take the risk that you will remain... silent
    about\n what you have seen in the desert. Goodbye, "
  616: Whoa! Wait a minute...!
  617: Oh yeah? Bring it on so I can slaughter your entire family, one by one.
  620: Very well. You must choose a name…
  621: How about…
  630: |-
    (Nods) That is a…good name. Now go speak to Mason. He will have…
    something for you.
  640: 'Greetings, '
  645: 'I have no further need of your services, '
  650: "..."
  651: "...hurkkk..."
  652: "...*gasp*...I...*cough*...*wheeze*..."

  658: "...I..."
  659: "::Stops breathing.::"
  660: Heh-heh. I love killing old people.
  675: |-
    (Mr. Salvatore looks at you for a long time in silence, then speaks.) We
     Salvatores...we will rule New Reno. If a child must die to insure that, it will
     be...done. There is no other reason.
  676: What did killing Wright's son have to do with ruling New Reno? That makes no
    SENSE.
  677: |-
    You murdered someone's SON, Salvatore. You might as well have just signed
     your own death warrant...
  678: All right then. I just wanted to know why you did it.
  800: You have assassinated Boss Salvatore.
  825: You have whacked Boss Salvatore.
  850: You have resolved the Lloyd "situation".
  875: You have collected Mr. Salvatore's tribute.
  900: You have become a made man of the Salvatore family.
  925: You have successfully completed the secret transaction.

  5290: ": What…do you WANT of me?"

  155: Myron...sir, do you have a minute…?
  156: Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, Myron, sir?
  157: Myron...sir, these new results are very promising…

  159: Where the hell is Myron…
  160: Get Myron up here. He has to see this.
  161: Wish these slaves would shut up…
  162: Where did I leave that syringe…
  163: Has anyone seen Subject 31? He was here just a second ago.
  164: Have the slaves bring more of the Jet Beta.
  165: Test results from Jet Beta are very promising, but…
  166: '"High" lasts 15 min to an hour…calculate one dose/hour period…hmmmmnnn.'
  167: Subject 12 still keeps having bleeding in the lungs…
  168: That's the fifth time Subject 12 has had seizures…up the dose, see what happens…
  169: Well, what SORT of hallucinations was he having?
  170: Check that one's heart rate. If it's still within tolerable limits, up the
    dosage.
  171: Why did the slave in the control group kill herself? We weren't even testing
    her!
  200: Tests are proceeding as scheduled, Myron.
  201: |-
    This new strain of Jet is extremely habit-forming, sir. The slaves are almost
     willing to kill each other for it.
  202: The slaves would rather take Jet than eat, it's so potent.
  203: Who are these people with you, Myron? New subjects?
  204: The third test group seem to be doing the best of all the groups, Myron, sir.
  205: Myron, I think the next test group should include at least three children,
    sir.
  206: |-
    Myron, sir, Subject 46 had a heart attack; we are restricting doses to six times
     a day from now on.
  207: |-
    Myron? We need a new shipment of hypodermics from Vault City, soon. We can't
     keep re-using these.
  208: Myron, at last! Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, sir?
  209: |-
    Myron, sir, we moved three slaves from the control group into the test group because
     of those respiratory failures we had last week.
  210: Myron, sir...we had to shoot one slave for trying to escape. What a waste.
  211: Myron...this new mild hallucinogen you've developed is promising, but it is
    not as habit-forming as jet…
  212: |-
    If you have any suggestions, please write it on a piece of paper and then put it right
     in the trash bin over there.
  213: Yes, yes, what?
  214: We won't be able to get results if you keep interrupting us.
  215: Seems they let everyone and their mother run through here nowadays…
  216: What do you want?
  217: Please excuse me, *I* have work to do.
  218: If you have questions, talk to the guards, not me.
  219: |-
    Yes, I'm certain that whatever you need is of *great* importance, but I have duties
     of my own.
  220: Are you authorized to be in here?
  221: Who allowed you in here?
  222: When Myron hears strangers were entering the lab…
  223: Do you have those test results I asked for…oh, sorry. Thought you were a lab
    tech.
  224: Too busy to talk right now, sorry.
  225: Need a new crop of slaves soon…these ones are running out of steam.

  269: Please go away, slaver. I don't want any trouble.
  270: Escape? I…have never tried to escape from here. I would not dare disobey my
    master.
  280: If they catch me talking to you, they will start testing chems on me.
  281: I used to work with this other slave, but he died of an overdose a few days
    ago.
  282: They test new chems on us. Some are poisonous.
  283: My master is...good to me.
  284: My master said not to speak to others.
  285: Please…I am not allowed to speak to you.
  286: Please let me be. My master will be back soon.
  287: If my master catches me talking to you, he will beat me.
  288: My master is good. He does not beat me often.
  289: I do not miss my family. My master is kind.
  290: I was taken from a tribal village north of here. Life is much…better here.
  291: I was first captured in the Den.
  292: I cannot speak to you. I have work to do.
  293: I must finish my duties before my master returns.
  294: Speaking is against the rules.
  295: Please go away. I beg you. You're only going to get me in trouble.
  296: Escape? There is nowhere to escape TO. The Wastes are filled with horrible
    monsters that will eat runaways alive.
  297: Slaves who become sick are usually killed.
  298: I was one of the slaves who made it to New Reno. Two others got sick during
    the trip, so the slavers shot them.
  299: Yes? How can I help you?
  300: I hear rumors of an underground railroad, but I don't know anyone who escaped.
  301: Julia escaped, but they caught her in Golgotha the next day. They tied her
    to a wheel and let her starve to death.
  302: Runaway slaves are caught and left to die in Golgotha.
  303: No, I don't know where my family is now. I still think about them sometimes,
    but not so often anymore.
  304: New Reno is…well, it is not as bad as the Den. In some ways.
  305: "::Turns away, frightened.::"
  306: "::Ignores you, frightened.::"
  307: Once you learn your new master's needs, the beatings become less…frequent.
  308: I was captured by slavers long ago. I barely remember it.
  309: I used to have two children, but they were shipped northwards. I hope they
    ended up somewhere better than here.
  310: I'm sorry, but I don't have time to talk.
  311: My master recently has become upset with me. He says he will sell me to the
    stables if I anger him again.
  312: Runaway slaves die on Golgotha or are shipped to the Stables for testing.

    INSECT, stoo-pid! We SAW one when we were out in the desert! It was as big… (Takes a deep breath.) …as big as a HOUSE!
     N'it had metal PEOPLE in it.
  351: Nuh-uh
  352: Don't call me stoopid
  353: 'Don''t shout. '
  5353: " no like shout."
  354: 'You lie to '

  7354: " not like."
  355: " has killed a lot of little loud people like you…maybe you next?"
  356: Wander off.
  360: UH-HUH. We saw it.
  362: Uh-uh-uh-uh
  363: Huh-huh-huh-huh
  364: Wander off and make "uhhh" noises at someone else.
  370: 'Uh-huh! I''ll show you! A bunch of us are going over there when it gets REALLY
    dark. '
  371: 'Uh-huh! I''ll show you! A bunch of us are going over there tonight. '
  372: Wanna come? (The little person squints at you.) But you gotta be reeeally quiet.
    Reeeeally quiet.
  373: Okee-dokee (Follow him.)
  374: Okee-dokee, me go wit…oooooh, that sand over there?
  380: I don't like you. You're a big stupid-head! (Sticks out his tongue.) Get outta

  381: DON'T CALL ME STOOPID! YOU STOOPID! YOU STOOPID!
  382: 'No shout! No shout at '
  5382: "! "
  6382: " SMASH!"
  383: Bite back your tears and run away
  384: All right…this time. Go easy on the Jet, kid.
  390: "(Squints at you.) You sound like my Mom and Dad when they go to bed."
  391: Where you see incest? I wanna see too
  400: 'I''m not lying, stupid! A bunch of us are going over there when it gets REALLY
    dark. '
  401: 'I''m not lying, stupid! A bunch of us are going over there tonight. '

  412: Wanna come? (Squints at you.) But you gotta be reeeally quiet. Reeeeally quiet.
  420: It's not a pot, STUPID! It's my helmet!
  421: Whoa, sorry there, fearsome helmed warrior.
  422: Call me stupid AGAIN, you little shit, and we'll see how well that 'helmet'
    protects you from a gaping head wound.
  423: "(Let him play with his 'helmet.')"
  430: "(Glares at you suspiciously.) Whaddya want?"
  432: I just wanted to know what kind of game you're playing. It looks like fun!
  433: Uh…where are your parents?
  434: Nothing.
  440: "(The little man turns white, takes a step back, then turns and runs, screaming
    his head off.)"
  441: "(The kid turns white, takes a step back, then turns and runs, screaming his
    head off.)"
  442: Hee hee...run, little mann! RUN!
  443: Little punk…
  450: 'Metal insects n'' soldiers. '
  451: "(Looks at your equipment, spots one of your pistols.) Can I play with yer
    gun?"
  452: No, no...it's too dangerous to play with, youngster.
  453: No. You'll shoot your eye out.
  454: Why, sure you can, you little pothead. Here you go. (Give him an unloaded pistol.)
  455: Why, sure you can, you little pothead. Here you go. (Give him a loaded pistol.)
  456: '"Metal insects?"'
  457: Oh, okay. I was just curious.
  458: Nooooo...I think I better be going.
  470: "(Glares at you.) C'mon, I know how to use guns like that! I'm in Family Wright!
    Let me see it! Pleeease?"
  471: 'Look: In the wrong hands, a gun is a deadly weapon. Well, I mean, it''s ALWAYS
    a deadly weapon, but in the wrong hands…it''s, uh…deadly…hold on, let me start
    over.'
  472: Look, if your family trusted you with a gun they would have given you one.
    Forget it.
  473: I don't care if you're in Family Badass, you ain't getting this gun.
  474: Well, all right. (Give him an unloaded pistol.)
  475: Well, all right. (Give him a loaded pistol.)
  476: Forget it. Go play with your friends.
  485: |-
    Yeah, metal insects! We SAW one when we were out in th' desert! It was as big… (Takes a deep breath.) …as big as
     a HOUSE! N'it had metal PEOPLE in it.
  486: Really! Wow! Where did you see it?
  487: You're lying!
  488: I don't believe you. You're lying.
  489: You better go easy on the Jet, kid. That stuff'll kill you. Later.
  490: Really? That's amazing. I may have to go out there sometime and see for myself.
    Bye.
  500: In th' desert. (Squints at you suspiciously.) It's probably not there anymore,
    though.
  501: Are you sure you wouldn't want to show it to me anyway?
  502: Can you show me where you saw it anyway?
  503: Oh, okay. See you, then.
  510: 'In th'' desert. (Glances around, starts whispering.) A bunch of us are going
    out there when it gets REALLY dark. '
  511: 'In th'' desert. (Glances around, starts whispering.) A bunch of us are going
    out there tonight. '
  513: I'm never quiet when I come. But just this once…
  514: I'll be quiet. Lead on, MacDuff.
  515: Uh, I don't think you'll be seeing that 'metal insect' anymore. It was actually
    a helicopter.
  516: Not tonight, thanks. Early day tomorrow.
  530: Hunh? (Frowns and adjusts the pot on his head.) What's a hello-copter?
  531: It's a…flying machine. It can hold people and stuff inside.
  532: |-
    A helicopter is...I guess the closest approximation you'd be familiar with is 'automobile.' A helicopter is like
     an automobile that's able to rise off the ground and hover through the use of vertically rotating blades. The helicopter's
     engine spins the blades so fast it keeps it aloft. Isn't that incredible?
  533: Nevermind. Just don't go wandering around outside of town again. It could get
    you killed.
  540: I'm NOT lying! We SAW it in the desert! (He glares at you sullenly.)
  541: Hmmm. Maybe you ARE telling the truth. Can you show me where you saw it?
  542: Okay, I believe you. Will you show me where you saw it?
  543: Okay, okay. Nevermind. Go back to playing your game.
  550: 'I''m NOT lying! We SAW it in the desert! I can PROVE it! (Glares at you.)
    A bunch of us are going over when it gets a little darker. '
  551: 'I''m NOT lying! We SAW it in the desert! I can PROVE it! (Glares at you.)
    A bunch of us are going over there tonight. '
  552: Come along, and I'll show it to you. (Sneers.) If yer not SCARED.
  556: No thanks. Go back to playing your game.
  560: "(You take your crappiest gun from your pack and give it to the kid. He smiles
    and holds it up, admiring it.) MY gun! Cool! "
  561: I know where I can get ammo for it, too!
  562: Uh, you can't keep it. It's just a loan...
  563: Yep, all yours. Now tell me about these metal insects…
  564: |-
    Lock and load, kid. Say...why don't you go show your gun to Daddy? Be sure to wave it around a lot and pull that little
     switch beneath the gun there.
  565: Sure is. Enjoy. Catch you later.
  570: Tribal giver! It's mine! You gave it to me! It's my gun!
  571: Give it back, you little shit!
  572: No, it's mine. I had to hurt a lot of people for that gun. Can I pleeeease
    have it back?
  573: Oh, hell. This post holocaust world can't get any worse. Go on and play with
    it.
  580: Nuh-uh! (He runs off with your gun.)
  581: Come back here, you little shit!
  590: Okay! (He runs off.)
  591: Well, THIS little act of evil might take a while to bear fruit…better leave
    the area and come back.
  592: "(Calmly leave the vicinity, whistling innocently.)"
  600: "(Shrugs.) Daddy's in the house, Mommy's at church."
  603: All right then. Just curious. Thanks.
  610: "(The kid lets the pot fall down over his head, and resumes *bzzzzing* around.)"
  620: "(The kid shrugs. He lets the pot fall down over his head, and resumes *bzzzzing*
    around.)"
  630: "(He shakes his head. He lets the pot fall down over his head, and resumes
    *bzzzzing* around.)"
  631: Uh, okay.
  632: You little punk…see if I save you when I'm saving the world...
  640: You wait until it gets a little darker...
  641: You wait until it gets dark...
  642: "...then you follow the kids into the desert."
  700: GET AWAY FROM ME!
  701: Ahhh...
  702: Help me, help me...
  703: MEAN PERSON! GET AWAY!
  704: GET AWAY FROM ME!
  710: Hey, thanks for the cool gun, mister.
  711: Hey, thanks for the cool gun, lady.
  720: Did one of you jerks take my gun this guy gave to me?
  721: Where did my gun go?
  722: I know you gave me a gun, what did I do with it?

  151: You see one of Wright's sons. He looks like he's packing a few weapons and
    looks a little too young to know what to be doing with them.
  152: You see one of Wright's sons. He glares at you unsuccessfully.

  162: You see one of Wright's daughters. She ignores you, but drops her hand to her

  205: 'Way to smash the Enclave, '
  1205: ". That took some serious guts."
  206: You must have been tougher than Tommy the Balls to break the Enclave like you
    did.
  207: Those Enclave fellas sound like real bastards.
  208: They were gonna dump some new VIRUS into the air? Bastards. Hope you shot a
    few for me.
  209: I thought the President was a myth, a boogeyman used to scare children.
  210: You look like you've been through hell and back. Relax for a while. You deserve
    it.
  211: You gonna replay the game as a different character? I recommend an Outdoorsman
    type.
  212: F.E.V.? What's that?
  213: New Reno was designed by Chris Avellone and scripted by Tom French. Tom plays
    in a band. Chris plays with himself.
  214: I hope I get to be a major character in Fallout 3, like Tandi or Ian. Bein'
    a thug sucks.
  215: Heard you busted up that Enclave down South. You're pretty brave.
  225: How do you go to the bathroom with that thing on?
  230: Keep that weapon outta sight around the youngsters, okay?
  231: Don't be flashin' that weapon 'round the youngsters, okay?
  235: You nearly scart the devil outta me, sneakin' around like that!

  275: Drop the weapon! Now!
  276: Put that weapon down, or we'll shoot!

  281: What th' hell…er, heck, you sneakin' around for? You lookin' to get shot?

  288: That some kind of rovin' brain display case you got with you?
  289: That a robot? I ain't never seen one of those before.
  295: Tell me that ain't a mutant.
  296: That a mutant?
  297: Holy brahmin turds. Mutants in New Reno. Must mean trouble…
  298: That mutant is one big mutha.

  305: What do you want?
  306: Help you with somethin'?
  307: Damn hot…

  310: If you're lookin' for alcohol, head on over to the train station in the north
    part of town…we don't sell it here.
  311: Watch yer step around here, friend. This here's Wright Family territory.
  320: You should go play with the youngsters with that armor on. They'd love it.
  321: Don't step on any of the little ones with that armor on, y'hear?
  322: Aren't you hot in there?

    You look like you belong in a battle mech computer game. This is Fallout 2. Maybe you opened the

  1335: "? Run into any trouble with anybody in town?"
  336: Good to have you in the family, uh, even though you aren't family, y'know?
    Uh…nevermind.
  337: I heard Tommy the Balls was back in town. Scary.
  338: We Wrights are the strongest family 'cause we ARE family.
  339: Shame about my lil' brother. He was a good kid, but Jet's all over this town,
    hard to avoid it…
  340: Dad said he'd strangle us if he ever hears about us takin' Jet.
  341: Dad's still upset, so be careful when you talk to him, y'hear?
  342: Chris's gonna get a whippin' if he keeps sneakin' inta the whorehouse.
  343: Damn hot…
  344: Ain't seen Mom for a while. If you see her, don't mention nothin' about the
    stills, 'kay?

  347: If you're lookin' for alcohol, head on over to the train station in the north
    part of town…we don't sell it here.

  349: Can you teach me to fight, too?
  350: 'Yer that fighter, '
  1350: ", aincha? Yer good in the ring, best I ever seen in these parts."
  351: You fight good. You should talk to Dad…er, the boss, about a job.
  352: We could use a strong arm around town, if yer interested.
  353: When you gonna fight again?
  354: I'd bet on you, but Mom gets so pissed off when we gamble.
  355: They built you tough, no doubt.
  356: Watch out for the Masticator, all right? He's a mean one. Sooner bite your
    ear off than look at you.
  360: Mom says yer a tool of the devil. Or that you have a devil's tool. Something
    like that.
  361: Better not stick around…Mom might see you and start preaching.
  362: So what's it like in the movies? Mom won't let me go see your films.
  363: Don't tell the little ones what you do.
  364: Mom'll throw a fit if she sees you. She's so histrionic.
  365: If you're lookin' for alcohol, head on over to the train station in the north
    part of town…we don't sell it here.

  374: Are you REALLY talkin' to God when you're havin' sex on stage?
  375: Mom says yer a tool of the devil.
  376: Mom says yer a harlot. A brazen strumpet. I have no idea what's she goin' on
    about.
  385: You here to see Dad about business? Well, good luck, I don't think he's hiring
    any hands now.
  386: If you're lookin' for alcohol, head on over to the train station in the north
    part of town…we don't sell it here.
  387: Watch yer step around here, friend. This here's Wright Family territory.
  390: Better take off…we don't take kindly to slavers.
  391: Don't you even THINK about kidnapping anyone here. You cause any trouble, we'll
    gut you.
  392: Just keep your distance, slaver. If you've got business with Pa, do it, then
    get.
  393: You better not have brought any chems, or else Dad'll kill you. Then I'LL kill
    you.
  394: I'm watchin' you, slaver, so you watch what you do, hear?
  395: You touch any of those kids, slaver, and I'll shoot you so much you'll fly
    outta your boots.
  396: Touch any of those kids, slaver, and I'll kill you.
  397: If you're lookin' for alcohol, slaver, head on over to the train station in
    the north part of town…we don't sell it here.
  398: You harm any Wright, slaver, and our Family won't rest until yer hide is rotting
    in Golgotha.
  399: You here to see Dad about business? I don't think Dad does business with slavers.
    You better git.
  410: Better take off…no offense, but Dad doesn't like tribals much.
  411: Don't you even THINK about causing any trouble. We Wrights outnumber you by…uh,
    by a lot.
  412: Just keep your distance. If you've got business, do it, then get.
  413: You better not have brought any chems, or else Dad'll kill you. Then I'LL kill
    you.
  414: I'm watching you, so you watch what you do, hear?
  415: Where you from? Ain't seen your kind around here in a while.
  416: If you're lookin' for alcohol, head on over to the train station in the north

    Golgotha.
  418: You here to see Dad 'bout business? Good luck, I don't think he's hiring any
    hands now.
  425: That ghoul shouldn't be around here. You better send him back to Gecko.
  426: You better not bring that ghoul around the kids. They might get radiation poisoning.
  427: I suggest you and yer ghoul friend leave before there's trouble.

  100: You see Myron! Myron, baby, Myron!
  150: You see a pasty-faced teenager leering at you. His hair is greasy, and he smells
    faintly of formaldehyde.
  151: You see Myron. He's scoping you out from the corner of his eye.
  200: You see a pasty-faced teenager. His hair is greasy, and he smells faintly of
    formaldehyde.
  201: You see Myron. He's looking around like a ferret.
  202: You see Myron. He sniffs occasionally, as if he has a cold.
  203: You see Myron. He looks bored.
  204: You see Myron. As you watch, he gives a wide yawn, then rubs his eyes.
  210: Get off your asses and get in here, guys! We got an intruder!
  215: What the hell do you want?
  216: If you're here for Jet, don't waste my time, just get out.
  217: Thought I smelled something…
  225: Hell-oooo, beautiful.
  226: Come over here and talk to me a minute. I don't bite.
  227: Don't tease. Come on over.
  228: I think loooove just walked in.
  229: Come here often?
  230: Mmmm-mmmm. Those legs go all the way up?
  235: What is that smell? Smells like a tribal.
  236: Nice bone on your friend, there. Tres chic.
  237: That tribal your slave?
  238: Your tribal friend over-compensating for something?
  239: How the hell did that thing get in here?
  240: Great. Now they're letting mutants in here.
  241: Is that really a vise on yer mutant's shoulder?
  242: That mutant your slave?
  243: Does yer ugly mutant friend get mad easy?
  244: What is that smell? Smells like a mutant.
  255: What stinks? Smells like something died.
  256: Great. Now they're letting ghouls in here.
  257: You need to air out that ghoul of yours. He smells pretty ripe.
  258: That ghoul radioactive?
  259: Rub a skunk on your ghoul so it smells better, OK?
  265: Are we going to do something sometime soon?
  266: Let's get more women in this chicken-shit outfit.
  267: Could we go somewhere where there's more women?
  268: You should be glad I'm with you to point out all your stupid mistakes.
  375: Hey, I'm dying over here! Give me a stimpack already!
  376: Is this my blood?
  377: Medic!
  378: Owwwww. Fuck! Owwwww, that hurts!
  379: Ow! That smarts!
  380: Owwwwwwww Owwwww Ow. Ow. Ow?
  381: Owwww. Wish SOMEONE would patch these wounds.
  390: Give me a goddamn stimpack before I pass out!
  391: Give me a damn stimpack! I'm going into shock!
  392: Somebody give me some first aid, fast! I'm dying here!
  400: Whoa…I'm feeling a little weak…
  401: Let's see…I'm nauseous…palpitations…fever. Most likely poison.
  402: Uh…can't…last…much…longer…poison…spreading…
  403: Could someone please suck this poison out?
  410: Is that me glowing? Give me some RadX next time we dick around in radiation
    zones, okay?
  411: I need some Rad-away before the radiation eats my Gnads-away.
  412: Why don't we just drink the radioactive goo next time? At least we'll die faster!
  413: I could power New Reno with all the radiation in my body.
  414: I'm glowing brighter than New Reno at midnight. Anybody got some Rad-away?
  415: Great. A little radiation, and I'm a human flashlight.
  416: Somebody let me hold the Rad-Away. I won't use all of it. I promise.
  425: Why don't we go back to the first level of the dungeon where all the kobolds
    are?
  426: Good thing playing D&D all those years taught me a few things about courage.
  427: Pass the Buffout. I think I'm going to need it soon.
  428: Great place. Great place to visit. How about we keep our stay short?
  429: Oh, this is MUCH better than being in some cozy whorehouse.
  430: Let's get in, get out, all right?
  431: How about we visit this place later?
  432: Why the hell are we here?
  433: This place ain't doing much for my morale.
  434: I say we send ol' Bonenose to check out the area. Alone.
  435: Why don't we send ol' Bone-nose out to scout the area?
  445: Why don't we send ol' Marcus out to scout the area?
  446: I say we send Marcus out to check out this area. Alone.
  447: Pass the Buffout. I think I'm going to need it soon.
  448: Why don't we go back to the first level of the dungeon where all the kobolds
    are?
  449: Good thing playing D&D all those years taught me a few things about courage.
  450: Great place. Great place to visit. How about we keep our stay short?
  451: Oh, this is MUCH better than being in some cozy whorehouse.
  452: Let's get in, get out, all right?
  453: How about we visit this place later?
  454: Why the hell are we here?
  455: This place ain't doing much for my morale.
  456: Let's send ol' Lenny to check out this area. Alone.
  457: Why don't we send ol' Lenny out to scout the area?
  465: Hey, thanks. I could use a little pick me up.
  466: Nothing like a strict chem regimen to keep my mind limber.
  467: This doesn't mean we're married, does it?
  468: Got any weed?
  469: Let me hold the stimpacks, okay?
  470: Ahhhhhhhhh.
  471: Ooooooohhh. Aaaaaaaah. Mmmmmm.
  472: I love it when you do that.
  473: Chems make me feel all pixellated.
  485: Hey, don't use that shit on me! Save it for reliants!
  486: Look, I don't want to fly, and you don't either. Bury that shit somewhere.
  487: Why don't you give that shit to ol' Bone-nose?
  495: Why don't you give that shit to ol' Marcus?
  496: Hey, don't use that shit on me! Save it for reliants!
  497: Man, I don't want to fly and you don't either. Bury that shit somewhere.
  498: Why don't you give that shit to ol' Lenny?
  505: All right, all right. I'm on it.
  506: Stand back, idiot. I'll figure it out.
  507: This looks simple. Stand back, all right?
  508: No problem.
  509: Time for the ol' 'magic fingers' routine…
  515: Bingo!
  516: Eureka!
  517: Fuckin' Ay!
  518: Myron does it again. Crowd goes wild!
  519: Hey, I found something.
  520: All done. Fineto.
  521: Easier than riding a bicycle. Or your mother! Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!
  522: Yes. Myron is -- the Science God.
  523: Beep. Myron has used the SCIENCE skill successfully.
  530: Nothing.
  531: Nada.
  532: No luck.
  533: Crap! I tried everything…
  534: I can't do anything with this.
  535: I didn't find out anything. This time.
  536: Maybe with some mentats I could pull this off…mmmm. Mentats.
  537: My skill ain't high enough. Spend some skill points on me, then I'll try again.
    Ha-Ha.
  538: I didn't learn anything.
  539: I can't make a successful Science Roll under these conditions.
  540: Beep. Myron has used the SCIENCE skill unsuccessfully.
  550: All right, all right! Stop pushing!
  551: You better stop pushing me, or I'll...well, just stop pushing me.
  552: Well, excuuuuuuse me.
  553: All right. But next time, YOU get out of MY way.
  554: I was here first. But have it your way.
  560: Don't need to tell me twice.
  561: I could use some womanly healing, know what I mean?
  562: Ahhhhhhh. Good thing stimpacks aren't too habit-forming.
  563: Oooooh, yeah. Good thing stimpacks aren't too habit-forming.
  570: Don't inject me with that shit. I'm fine, okay?
  571: Stop mothering me. I'm all right.
  572: Hey, don't sweat it. I'm fine. But let me hold the stimpacks anyway.
  580: Hey, let me join you again! C'mon!
  581: I'm sorry I was being such a jerk. Give me another chance.
  582: I'm getting sick of waiting around for you.
  583: I'm so bored. C'mon, let me hang out with you.
  584: I wish I'd brought a book.
  585: I'm NOT going to wait for you much longer.
  590: So...is Miria really your wife?
  591: Miria's kinda cute. Can I...well, you know…how about it?
  592: Your wife suuuure is a looker.
  593: So...you and Miria. Are you two serious, or...?
  594: So...you and Miria. Are you both free to see other people, or....?
  595: You wanna swap wives? You can have mine as soon as I get one.
  600: Ready to go?
  605: Why the hell are we HERE?
  606: Everybody in this town needs an enema.
  607: Being in Vault City makes me…disgruntled.
  608: What is it about Vault City that makes me want to crap?
  609: When are we going back to Reno?
  615: So you finally came around, huh? I knew you would. You need me.
  616: So you finally came around, huh, beautiful? I knew you would. All right, I'll
    join up with you again.
  617: Yeah, what? Can'tcha see I'm thinking here?
  618: So you finally wise up, beautiful? Finally realize that I'm the only one for
    you?
  619: You don't look too good, Myron. Heal yourself.
  620: Wait here until I, uh, come back.
  621: Put that weapon away before you hurt yourself.
  622: Keep close to me.
  623: Put a little distance between us, Myron.
  624: Spread out a bit, Myron. It's best for both of us.
  625: I had some questions…
  626: Not now, Myron. I had some questions…
  627: All right, then. Hurry up and let's go.
  628: No, you keep waiting here. I'll be back. I promise.
  629: I'll let you get back to doing nothing then.
  630: Myron, your hand is the only "one" for you.
  640: It's around on Golgotha somewhere...I'll let you know when I see it.
  641: All right, Myron.
  645: Yeah. What's on your mind?
  646: Tell me about Jet.
  647: Can you make any Chems?
  648: You don't look in top shape, Myron. Try and patch yourself up.
  650: Where was that Mordino stash you were talking about?
  655: Ah, my finest little addiction. What about it?
  656: We've been over this. I'm not here to be your memory.
  657: We've been over this. Look, I'll be your love slave, beautiful, but I ain't
    gonna be your memory.
  658: How did you create it?
  659: Is there any cure for it?
  660: Can you make me some Jet?
  661: You'll be a corpse if you don't answer my questions. How did you create Jet?
  662: Cut the shit, Myron. Is there any cure for Jet?
  664: I'd sooner lance a boil with my tongue than let you be my sex slave, Myron.
  665: Myron, 'love slave' is the last thing that crosses my mind when I think of
    you.
  666: I was thinking of using you more as a practice dummy than a love slave, actually.
  667: I'd sooner kiss Sulik than let you be my love slave. Uh…no offense, Sulik.
  668: I'd sooner kiss Marcus than let you be my love slave. Uh…no offense, Marcus.
  669: Nevermind, Myron.
  680: Uh, in my lab. Next question?
  681: HOW did you develop it, smart guy?
  682: Forget this. Different topic…
  683: I can see where this is going. Nevermind, Myron.
  690: Ah, Christ. Well...when I came across the Mordino family way back when, they
    were farming peyote cacti and trying to sell it to tourists as the 'Reno experience.'
    Total bullshit.
  691: Go on.
  692: Forget this. I had some other questions…
  693: Forget I mentioned it.
  700: I mean, peyote? C'mon. It isn't even half the strength of, say, old school
    LSD.
  701: Uh, about the Jet --?
  710: Plus, a peyote trip is too long. The profit's in fast turn around and high
    addiction. Like, uh, barbitutates before the Big One, y'know?
  711: I hope this is leading somewhere.
  712: If you say so.
  713: Barbiturates…like old school cocaine, crank, all that?
  714: You mean barbiturates…like old school cocaine, crank, all that?
  716: Nevermind, Myron. I don't have time for your long-winded bullshit.
  725: 'Right. Can I finish? '
  5725: Fine, fine. What was the problem with making barbiturates?
  726: Problem is, in the new climate, we can't grow most of the veggies needed for
    the best drugs.
  727: You just like hearing yourself talk, right?
  728: I'm with you.
  729: You mean 'veggies' as in coca plants, opium poppies, that sort of thing.
  740: 'Couldn''t grow coca plants, opium poppies -- and man did we try -- so we figured
    our best bet was shrooms. '
  741: 'Right, sherlock. And we tried -- so we figured our best bet was shrooms. '
  5741: Why?
  742: You can grow 'em if you use plenty o' brahmin shit as fertilizer.
  743: Speaking of plenty of shit...Go on.
  744: OK...
  755: Plus, hallucinogens have low overhead, so I start experimenting with derivatives
    of lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin. Still…
  756: Still...?
  765: Still, I really wanted to whip up a hard-hitter that didn't rely on veggie
    extracts. Man, was I an idiot, 'cause the answer turned out to BE the extracts,
    or, more precisely, what they were growing IN.
  766: You don't really care what I say, do you? You just love telling your story.
  767: How do you mean?
  775: See, old Jesus Mordino wanted something that the Redding miners would get addicted
    to fast AND make them work harder. So, I said, 'no prob,' right?
  776: What was that about Redding?
  777: What was that about Redding, again?
  778: Right. Go on.
  779: Yeah, no prob.
  790: Well, wasn't too hard to come up with a good upper. A sample of that pre-war
    protein extract, corrupt it and bam -- decent amphetamine.
  791: Explain to me about Redding, again?
  792: Uh, "protein extract?"
  800: Redding? Town full o' gold diggers. Mordino wants to control it all. So he
    comes to me in his wheezing voice and says, 'Myron, Myron, make me something that'll
    give me Redding.'
  801: And you say…
  810: And I say, 'okay, what timeframe we looking at?' He goes - of course - 'yesterday.'
    Crime lords. Want everything done fast and sloppy. Least they don't have a marketing
    department.
  811: I see. Go back to talking about Jet production.
  820: |-
    Before the Big One some meat companies were experimenting with a cheap protein extract for growing food, but they had to ditch it.
     One little skin bacteria contaminates it, and it's all screwed.
  821: Screwed? How?
  830: The contaminated version acted like an amphetamine when ingested. Little side
    effect. Don't ask. It's, uh, technical.
  831: So…did you somehow get a hold of this protein extract?
  840: I didn't have to. When they first screwed up, they contaminated tons of that
    shit. And rather than ditch it, they fed it to their brahmin herds to try and
    recoup their losses.
  841: Uh, okay...
  842: This better be going somewhere, Myron.
  843: So you used brahmin shit as fertilizer for the shrooms, except the pre-war
    protein contamination gives whatever shrooms grown in brahmin shit…certain extra
    ingredients?
  850: Close...
  5851: Yes...?
  851: See, we start experimenting with the brahmin shit as fertilizer for the shrooms,
    except get this; then, we noticed the slaves working fertilizer vats were getting
    high from the fumes…
  853: So the fumes were enough to produce the effect?
  860: Riiiight...
  5861: I thought so.
  861: By putting tons of brahmin shit in the vats, we found out that the fumes give
    more than enough of a kick. Eureka. Literally. 'Course, we had to test to get
    the mix right…
  862: Uh, how much testing?
  863: How much testing exactly?
  865: Nevermind, Myron.
  866: This sounds like a load of crap…literally. It doesn't sound like you know anything
    about chem manufacture. "Brahmin Shit Fumes?" Please. I've heard enough.
  870: Hmmm...about a hundred slaves? Mostly heart attacks, cerebral hemorrhages,
    psychotic episodes...that sort of thing.
  871: Are you insane? You killed a hundred human beings just for chem testing?!
  872: Figures…Jet can be pretty powerful stuff. Least nobody important died. Still,
    hard to believe you killed that many, though…
  873: I see. Look, I had some other questions...
  880: Well, not on purpose. I mean, slaves are expensive. Still, we made the money
    back in the first few months, so the Mordino Family wasn't too pissed at me.
  881: I think you and I are going to get along, Myron. Ends justify the means. Say,
    I had some other questions…
  882: Myron, you are lower than a snake's shadow. Killing humans for chem testing…that's
    the coldest thing I've ever heard.
  883: Myron, you killed over a hundred humans beings for the sake of chem testing?
    Did you get your conscience lobotomized when you were a kid?
  884: Tell me about it. Slave prices keep going up. If humans only bred faster. Anyway,
    I had some other questions…
  885: I…see. Look, I had some other questions…
  886: I think I've heard enough.
  887: Oh, well, THAT makes it all right, then. I've heard enough. I'm out of here.
  890: You getting bent at me over a bunch of slaves? Hey, we had to make sure Jet
    wouldn't kill our customers.
  891: You have a point, Myron. I had some other questions…
  893: Oh, well, THAT makes it all right, then. Congratulations, Myron. You have hit
    the lowest common denominator possible for a human being. I'm out of here.
  894: Sounds sensible. Maybe we'll talk later.
  900: How quaint. A cure. Sure. You go cold turkey. Course, I made sure that was
    a reeeal difficult option with Jet.
  901: Beautiful, look. This is drug addiction, not an STD. Only cure is to go cold
    turkey, heh heh, and that's a reeeal difficult option with Jet.
  902: How did you create Jet?
  903: Myron, you're a pretty smart fella. Consider it a challenge. What would it
    take to make a cure for Jet?
  910: Ah for fuck's sake, it can't be done, all right? It's a goddamn drug, not a
    bacterial infection.
  911: It's basically a highly habitual meta-amphetamine, right? Couldn't you use
    a nervous system suppressant to break the reliance?
  913: Nevermind, Myron. Forget I asked.
  920: Nice try, no dice. Jet ain't blocked that easy. Once it's in your system, it
    ain't coming out.
  921: What about using some kind of endorphin blocker? That would repress the chemical
    and psychological addition, wouldn't it?
  924: Nevermind then.
  930: Kee-rist. That has got to be the dumbest...hmmmm...
  931: Well?
  940: Well...maybe it would work, but I'm pretty sure Jet would just chew right through
    that shit. Now wh-wh-why the hell are we even talking about this?! Wh-where would
    you get your hands on endorphine blockers anyway?
  941: You tell me, Myron. You're a bright guy.
  950: Maybe Vault City. They have a pretty good medical warehouse. A lot of old pre-holocaust
    bases also used to stock them to prevent combat drug addiction.
  951: Why don't we try Vault City?
  952: Pre-holocaust bases? Where?
  954: All right. Maybe I can find some somewhere.
  960: Ha! You'd have better luck convincing a radscorpion to part with its tail than
    get Vault City to give up anything.
  961: What about those pre-holocaust bases? Where are those?
  962: Yeah, maybe. Look, I had some other questions...
  963: No harm in trying.
  970: Do I look like a cartographer? You want to scour the desert for them, you go
    right ahead.
  971: What about Vault City?
  973: Thanks for nothing, Myron.
  974: I just might do that.
  980: Oooh...with a wit like that, you're sure to wise up and go for me, beautiful.
    You'll see.
  981: Whatever. How did you create Jet?
  983: Yeah, we'll see. Can you make me some Jet?
  985: Forget I asked anything, Myron.
  990: Wha-a-a-are you fucking serious? Whoa, whoa, hey, hey...you keep me around,
    I'll do you a favor. Huh? Wh-Whadda ya say?
  991: Like what kind of favor?
  992: Forget favors. Now buzz off, you annoying pest.
  993: Forget favors. Now wait here, you annoying pest.
  994: Forget I said anything. You can stay.
  1005: Hoh! Oh, so-o-o what was that, like tribal humor? Yea, hardy-har-har. Pretty
    fucking funny.
  1006: Yeah, we tribals are famous for it. Let's get going.
  1010: Okay! Okay! I'll wait here. Phew! You could show me a little more respect,
    you know. I am MYRON.
  1020: I've heard of a secret building with lots of strange vegetation around it.
    If I'm with you, I can point it out on a map.
  1021: Could be I know one of Mordino's little stashes in Golgotha outside of Reno.
    Lotsa chips. Lotsa drugs. Just gotta keep me around.
  1022: I'll...I'll carry more of your stuff! No hassles when you ask me to make drugs!
    Just keep me around, okay?
  1023: Okay. You can stay.
  1026: Forget it, Myron. Wait here until I get back.
  1035: '"Can I make drugs?" I''m Myron. Whaddya need?'
  1036: Hey, can't get enough, huh? Whaddya need?
  1037: An antidote for radscorpion venom.
  1038: Some jet.
  1039: Some stimpacks.
  1040: Can you make super stimpacks?
  1041: Nothing. I had some other questions…
  1042: Nevermind.
  1050: Uhm, I'm gonna need some radscorpion venom sacs first. Ironic, in'it?
  1051: Oh, well, I'd looove to, beautiful, but I need radscorpion tails. Oh, well.
  1052: Can you make any other chems?
  1053: Forget it then. I had some questions…
  1060: Hmmm, Shouldn't be too hard. How many bottles of antidote you want?
  1061: Ah, for cryin' out loud. Ever think it might be easier to just stay away from
    the friggin' scorpions in the first place, genius? How many you want this time?!
  1062: Anything for you, beautiful. He-ha! How many you want?
  1063: Just one.
  1065: Three's a charm.
  1066: Make antidote out of all the tails that we have. They aren't good for much
    else.
  1067: Forget it. Can you make any other chems?
  1068: None; I've changed my mind. I had some questions…
  1081: Done. Here you go.
  1082: There. That's it. No more of that shit, all right? Next time, go find some
    backwater medicine man to do it.
  1083: Done. Here you go, beautiful.
  1085: Thanks. Look, I had some questions…
  1086: Thanks, Myron. You're a real sport.
  1095: Sorry, ain't got the "raw materials" I need...don't really wanna get 'em,
    either.
  1097: Forget it then. I had some other questions…
  1098: All right. Thanks a bunch, Myron.
  1105: Piece of cake. How many packs you want?
  1106: Hey, genius. Ever cross your mind that it might be easier just to stay outta
    trouble, huh? OK, how many?
  1107: Just tell me how much and where you want it, beautiful.
  1111: Make as many stimpacks as you can from what we're carrying.
  1113: Can you make super stimpacks?
  1114: Forget it. I had some questions...
  1125: 'Sorry, we just ain''t got what I need to whip up a stim. Let''s see: You''ll
    need some xander root…some rockflower...and an empty hypo.'
  1126: Can you make some other chems?
  1127: If you can make stimpacks, couldn't you make some super stimpacks?
  1128: All right then. I had some questions...
  1135: Of course I could…'cept we ain't got what I need. Some of that mutated fruit
    for the citric acid…a splash a' Nuka Cola...and a normal stim pack.
  1145: 'Repeat after me: Myron''s a genius. How many packs you want?'
  1146: How about. Stay. Out. Of. Trouble? Nevermind, obviously too tough a concept.
    How many this time?
  1147: Myron's your man, beautiful. How many?
  1149: Give me two.
  1151: Make as many stimpacks as you can from what we're carrying.
  1170: Who're you an' how the hell did you get in here? Wh-where are those jackass
    guards?
  1171: Why, helll-ooooo there, beautiful. What can Myron do to, ah-uh, for you?
  1172: Gud. Nuh-uh.
  1173: 'Hell-oooooo Moron. Me '
  1174: Gud. Ded.
  1175: Weak people watching door stop breathing when I hurt them
  1176: Bye-bye
  1177: Your guards are too busy being dead to be watching the door.
  1178: I used this badge. Marjorie sent me.
  1179: Who are you?
  1180: You Myron?
  1181: Easy there, tiger. Keep those hormones in check. Who are you?
  1182: Easy there, tiger. Keep those hormones in check. You Myron?
  1183: Sorry. I seem to have entered the wrong room.
  1195: So. Who are you? Spill it, or I'll have the guards BEAT it out of you.
  1196: Your guards are too dead to do much of anything. Got any other questions,
    you little shit?
  1197: Who are you?
  1198: You Myron?
  1199: I think I'll just go take a walk out of here. Nice meeting you.
  1205: Great. One of the mental midgets from upstairs. Look, I ain't got much here,
    but you can, tuh-tuh-take whatever you want.
  1206: WAN YOU DED
  1207: Wan Ull. Now.
  1208: 'Hoo yoo? Yoo FREN of '
  6208: "?"
  1209: Byeeeee
  1215: Sure! You bet! Uh, here you go. Here's all of it. Now uh, you go back to your
    stall now, okay?
  1216: Nuh-uh. Kill.
  1217: 'Hoo yoo? Yoo FRIEND of '
  6218: " go"
  1225: Abso-fucking-lutely! Heh, you bet! You and I are gonna be the best of friends,
    okay?
  1226: 'Lie? '
  6226: " KILL"
  1227: 'Fren give ull '
  1235: Of course you are. Have a seat on the bed. Can I get you a drink, maybe a
    little...Jet?
  1236: Sit. Drenk.
  1237: Yoo fren?
  1245: Excellent...here you go. A little drink - help you re-lax, y'know what I mean?
  1246: Drenk
  1247: 'Yoo '
  6247: "'s fren?"
  1255: Uh, hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute! Stay - have a drink first! We can talk,
    be friends. You DO want us to be friends, right?

  1275: Now, you just relax, sweetmeat…
  1276: Okeezzzzzzz Zznnzznn Zzznnnzzzz
  1285: Hmmmm. You must have the constitution of a Brahmin. Get outta here, beautiful.
  6287: " go."
  1295: Guards ain't worth the chips you pay for 'em...well, my retarded friend, we've
    been introduced, so why don't you GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE NOW!
  1296: OW EARS. KILL.

  1325: God-DAMN it! I told Jesus those two morons couldn't guard a stone! So uh,
    you iced them, huh? Gonna kill me, too?
  1326: Whoa. Hot and deadly! So you iced them, huh? You gonna kill me, too?
  1327: I'm thinking about it. You got something to convince me otherwise…kid?
  1328: Not unless you do something stupid. Who are you?
  1329: Not unless you do something stupid. You Myron?
  1330: 'Yeah, why not? I ain''t killed anyone since I started this conversation. '
  1331: 'Not now. Maybe later. '
  1345: 'Sure, pal. '
  1346: 'Sure, lady. '
  1347: 'You bet, beautiful. '
  1348: I-I can give you drugs. You lookin' to fly?
  1349: Actually, I want everything you have. Hand it over, and I'll let you live.
  1350: Sure. Give me all the chems you got.
  1351: I don't want anything right now. Maybe later.
  1365: All right, all right. Here you go. Now will you leave me alone?
  1366: No. Who are you?
  1367: No. You Myron?
  1368: Sure. For now…I may be back, though.
  1375: M-maybe. W-who the hell are you?
  1376: Say, you one of Mordino's new whores or just a big fan of Myron? Ooh, you
    got a name to go with those legs, beautiful?
  1377: Who the hell are you?
  1378: I'm someone who's been looking for someone like you, beautiful. And you are...?
  1379: "."
  6379: 'I''m '
  1380: I'm just a traveler passing through.
  1381: I'm someone who's in the wrong room. Later.
  1395: That so? Why are you here? Huh? Thought you could hit Myron up for some free
    drugs?
  1396: Whatever, beautiful. Want some drugs to break the ice, or should we just get
    down to some mattress dancing?
  1397: I would, but I don't have ten seconds to spare right now. What chems are you
    talking about?
  1398: Chems? Like what?
  1399: I'm definitely in the wrong room. Pardon me.
  1405: Hey stupid! Jet, mother fucker, Jet! Yer talkin' to its maker. Its creator.
    Its...God.
  1406: Are you stupid? Jet, bitch, Jet! Yer talkin' to its maker. Its creator. Its...God.
  1407: You ever heard of Jet, beautiful? Well, yer talkin' to its maker. Its creator.
    Its...God.
  1408: Bullshit. You didn't make Jet.
  1409: You made Jet?
  1410: You made Jet? No way! That stuff is making a KILLING on the streets!
  1411: Big deal. I'm out of here.
  1412: Your mother must be proud. Later, kid.
  1413: Really? Interesting. I have to go now.
  1425: I did so make Jet! What, you think this lab is for show?
  1426: Sorry to prove you wrong, beautiful, but look around. This lab ain't just
    for show.
  1427: All right. MAYBE you did make Jet.
  1428: Why did you make Jet?
  1430: Your mother must be proud. I'm out of here.
  1445: Damn right I did! I make the shit everybody wants and can't get enough of.
  1455: '"Why?" ''Cause I could. Family Mordino needed a product, Myron makes a product,
    Mordino makes Myron happy...at least as happy as they''re able. Nice lil'' circle
    o'' love, huh?'
  1456: How did you make Jet?
  1457: "'As happy as they're able?' Are you happy here?"
  1458: How about I suggest a new circle to you? Mordino doesn't know talent when
    they see it - I do.
  1459: Yeah, great. I have to be going now.
  1465: Ha, you wouldn't understand. It's WAY above you.
  1466: Don't you worry your pretty little head about it, beautiful. I can give you
    something else for your head to work on.
  1467: You happy here?
  1468: Yeah, I guess an idiot like me couldn't be expected to understand the process
    of manufacturing a hallucinogenic-amphetamine hybrid like Jet, huh?
  1469: Yeah, I guess a bimbo like me couldn't be expected to understand the process
    of manufacturing a hallucinogenic-amphetamine hybrid like Jet, huh?
  1472: I think you'd be surprised about how much I know about your amateurish hallucinogenic-amphetamine
    hybrid. I'm not convinced a child like you didn't just STUMBLE across it, Myron.
  1473: Well, thanks for making the effort, Myron. I have to be going now.
  1485: Pretty much. They give me whores, cash, drugs. My own lab. The creative freedom
    I need to make magic, but, well...no, naw, it's a good gig.
  1486: Well what? Are they treating you right?
  1487: Good to hear it, Myron. I have to be going now.
  1495: Well, see, the Mordinos don't show Myron the R-E-S-P-E-C-T, right? I tell
    'em what they should be doing, they say 'shut up, Myron' or 'go back to the lab,
    Myron.' Bastards.
  1496: Maybe I could help you. You want to ditch this town? Travel with me, and then
    the Mordinos will wake up to how valuable you are and quick.
  1497: You're too valuable to be here, Myron. You should leave.
  1498: Too bad, Myron. I have to be going now.
  1505: |-
    They've forgotten I'M the reason they control Reno AND the reason why Redding'll be sucking at their tit in a few
     months. Most Mordinos got more hair on their butt than brain cells, y'know what I'm saying?
  1506: Uh, I said, maybe I could help you...
  1507: You're definitely too valuable to be here, Myron...you should leave, like
    I was saying.
  1509: I'm beginning to see why they don't listen to you.
  1510: You bet, Myron. I have to be going now.
  1515: 'And another thing: The Mordinos can''t get it through their skulls that I
    ain''t interested in purifying Jet. It does what it''s supposed to do. I want
    to make NEW drugs, not re-tool old ones, y''know?'
  1516: I can help you. Why don't you ditch this town, travel with me, and then the
    Mordinos will wake up to how valuable you are.
  1517: You're absolutely right. You're too valuable to be here, Myron! You should
    leave!
  1518: What was that stuff you were saying about Redding?
  1525: 'Hmm....their boy wonder leaving town. Ha. That''d wake ''em up. Yeah. '
  6525: Sure would. I'd make them see what they'd really lost.
  1526: I like that.
  1527: I like the way you think, beautiful.
  1528: So where we headed?
  1529: So where we headed, beautiful?
  1530: Just follow me.
  1531: Then come with me.
  1532: Hold on a minute. I haven't said yes yet. What can you do, Myron? I can't
    just have anyone traveling with me. I got standards.
  1533: First off, what are you good at, Myron?
  1534: Nowhere yet. Say, I had some more questions…
  1535: Nowhere yet, Myron. I'll be back for you, though.
  1545: Naw, you look full up. Whydoncha ditch the tribal. Looks like he takes being
    a bone-head too seriously.
  1546: Naw, you look full up. And Myron doesn't hang with mutant trash. Ah-heh, no
    offense, big guy.
  1547: Uh, naw, you look full up. And uh, Myron doesn't hang with ghouls. Never know
    when they're gunna drop a body part on your shoe.
  1548: Naw, I don't want to hang out with another family. The Mordinos were enough.
    Lose some baggage, and then come talk to me.
  1549: Yeah, right. Flies wouldn't follow you if you were covered in shit. Huh, forget
    it.
  1550: All right then. Well, I have some other questions…
  1551: Pretty enlightened attitude. I'll think about it, Myron.
  1552: No, he's worth at least two of you. Later, kid.
  1553: Kid, your ego just wrote a check your body can't cash. Get ready to die.
  1554: They would, too! You'll see.
  1555: Your loss, Myron. Later.
  1565: Yeah? I'm listening...
  1566: Maybe we can help each other. I could use a man with your skills. Why don't
    you ditch this town, travel with me for a while, and then the Mordinos will wake
    up to how valuable you are.
  1567: Oh, forget what I said. Say, I had some other questions...
  1568: Forget it. It wouldn't work anyway.
  1575: 'All right. '
  1576: 'All right, beautiful. '
  1577: Why the hell not? Let's blow this popsicle stand.
  1578: We're outta here.
  1579: It's 106 miles to Arroyo, we got a full fusion cell, half a pack of Radaway,
    it's midnight, and I'm wearing a 50-year old Vault 13 jumpsuit. Let's hit it.
  1585: Ah! What, you need Myron's resume? I'm the science guy. Know all, see all.
    Not to mention I can make whatever drugs you need. With the right raw materials.
  1586: All right then, you've passed the interview. The part about the chems helped.
    Follow me.
  1587: I'll think about it. I have a few more questions for you...
  1588: Well, I'll think about it...it's just that, well, no offense, but science
    guys have a notorious reputation for being near worthless in combat.
  1589: I'll need to think about it. I'll be back.
  1595: Redding? Town full o' gold diggers. Mordino wants to control it all. So he
    comes to me in his wheezing voice and says, 'Myron, Myron, make me something that'll
    give me Redding.'
  1596: And you say...
  1597: Hmmm. I had some other questions...
  1605: And I say, 'okay, what timeframe we looking at?' He goes - of course - 'yesterday.'
    Crime lords. Want everything done fast and sloppy. At least they don't have a
    marketing department.
  1615: 'Yeah. Why? You gonna try and prove me wrong, pal? '
  1616: 'Yeah. Why? You gonna try and prove me wrong, lady? '
  1617: 'Yeah? But hey, don''t get all defensive on me, beautiful. You weren''t built
    for brains, y''know? '
  5616: Sure am. Try me.
  5617: I think I could show you a thing or two.
  1618: I've forgotten more about pharmaceutical research than you'll ever know.
  1619: Is there any cure for Jet?
  1620: Fine. Then how did you make Jet?
  1621: 'First off, answer me this: how did you make a hybrid hallucinogen-amphetamine?
    Jet seems to have some…unique properties.'
  1623: Forget it. I had some other questions…
  1624: Forget this. I'm outta here.
  1625: Kiss my ass, you arrogant shit. I'm outta here.
  1635: Amateurish? Ama-amateurish?! Jet's pure genius, and don't you forget it! And
    I didn't stumble across it, I MADE it.
  1636: I don't believe you. Show me the process.
  1637: Whatever, kid. I'm out of here.
  1645: 'Two words: brahmin shit.'
  1646: That what you use to grow the hallucinogen in?
  1647: You use brahmin shit as fertilizer to grow the Jet crop, right? What about
    it?
  1648: Don't want to tell me? Fine. Then I have some other questions…
  1649: All right then. I can see where this is going. Nevermind.
  1655: Very good. And that's all yer ever gonna learn, pal. You wanna know, you figure
    it out.
  1656: Very good. And that's all yer ever gonna learn, lady. You wanna know, you
    figure it out.
  1657: 'Very good, beautiful. But that''s all yer ever gonna learn, so don''t trouble
    your pretty little head about it. Enough talk: why don''t you and me, uh, hehh...'
  1658: So the brahmin shit has some chemical properties that stimulate the human
    nervous system?
  1659: I just might. I had some other questions…
  1660: "-- talk some more? Excellent! I had some questions…"
  1661: Fine. I have to be going.
  1662: Uh, why don't you and me talk later? Good idea. See you.
  1675: You sure do ask a lot of goddamn questions. The answer is yeah, maybe...say,
    wh-where did you learn all this stuff anyway? You from Vault City or something?
  1676: To answer your question, yeah...MAYBE. Where did YOU learn all this stuff?
  1677: Not exactly. I just pick this stuff up. It's pretty easy, really.
  1678: No. Look, I had some other questions…
  1679: Vault City. Where's that?
  1680: I'll let you wonder. You already told me everything I need to know.
  1685: Yeah, keep mouthing off, smartass. I could oxidize circles around you. I'm
    a natural. Self-taught. None of that bullshit Vault City 'purer-than-thou' 'tude,
    see?
  1686: Heh, huh, ha! You're a sharp one, beautiful...raven hair, teeth, claws…mmm-mmm.
    So you learn your shit at Vault City or what?
  1687: I didn't learn at Vault City. I just pick this stuff up. It's pretty easy,
    really.
  1689: I had some other questions…
  1695: What didja wanna know?
  1696: Tell me about this place.
  1697: Tell me about the Mordino Family.
  1699: I'm going to go now.
  1705: The Stables? We test new kinds o' Jet here. What about it?
  1706: The Stables? Uh, we test new kinds o' Jet here. What about it, beautiful?
  1715: They're my patrons. They're all right...I guess.
  1716: Well what? Aren't they treating you all right?
  1725: You again. So…ready to go?
  1726: Sure, Myron. Let's get out of here.
  1727: Hold on a minute. I haven't said yes yet. What can you do, Myron? I can't
    just have anyone traveling with me. I got standards.
  1728: First off, what skills do you have Myron?
  1729: No, not exactly. I had some questions...
  1730: Not at the moment. Why don't you just cool your heels for a while?
  1735: You're kind of weird...I like that.
  1736: You're kind of weird...I like that.
  1745: Stop mothering me.
  1746: Owww! Hurts! It hur - oh, it. No. No, I'm pretty much okay. Stings a little.
  1747: I'm dying over here! Gi-give me a stimpack. Or two. Or three.
  1748: Is...that...you? Can't...see...losing...consciousness. *Cough* *Cough* Help...me...
  1749: Hmmmm. Heal yourself again.
  1753: Give me a little distance, Myron.
  1756: Nevermind then. Let's go.
  1757: Suck it up, Myron. We got a lot of ground to cover.
  1765: Eh, excuse me. Wait for you here? Are you kidding? Tell me you're kidding.
  1766: Stay. Here. Until. I. Come. Back. Understand?
  1767: I'll be back. Don't sweat it.
  1775: Aw, c'mon...fine, whatever. Still want to try out that new burst-fire technique
    I've been working on, though.
  1776: Uh, this weapon? Oh...sorry about that, beautiful. It just seems to...pop
    out all the time, you know?
  1781: Maybe you better back off a little, Myron.
  1784: Not while you're hanging with me, you won't. Now let's go.
  1785: I heard it goes off prematurely, too. Now let's go.
  1795: Eh...all right. You ain't hitting on me, are you?
  1796: Whatever you say, gorgeous. Rrrrooow.
  1802: Actually, give me a lot of distance, Myron. It's best for both of us.
  1804: When I hit you, you'll know. Now let's go.
  1805: Calm down, Myron. Let's go.
  1815: Well...all right. But I hear it's the guys in the middle who always get it
    first.
  1816: All right, I'll just watch your ass...er...uh, back carefully.
  1820: 'Actually, forget that: Stay close to me instead.'
  1822: Spread out even more, Myron. It's best for both of us.
  1824: I'm counting on it. Now let's go.
  1825: Greeeeat. Let's go.
  1835: All right, I'll keep an eye on things back here. Gives me a good position
    to practice my burst-fire technique.
  1836: Wha -- do I have B.O. or something?! Sheesh.
  1841: Come a little closer, Myron.
  1844: Whatever. Now let's go.
  1845: If it was just your body odor, I could stand it. Let's go.
  1860: All right.
  1863: Kid, your ego just wrote a check your body can't cash. Get ready to die.
  1866: Let's go.
  1870: Mee feel oogy now.
  1875: You have convinced Myron there might be a cure.
  1880: That's the grave where Big Jesus' stashed those extra chips.
  1885: You have convinced Myron to leave the Stables.
  1957: All right, all right! Stop pushing!
  1958: Hey, give me a break. I didn't program my A.I.
  1959: Well, excuuuuuuse me.
  1960: All right. But next time, YOU get out of MY way.
  1961: I was here first. But have it YOUR way.
  2091: You got some chips to share? I need to save some women from their virginity.
  2675: Easy, huh? I'm the best. Twice as good as any of those Vault City pecker checkers.
  2676: Oh yeah, you're right about that. Easier to learn than that stuff those Vault
    City pecker checkers would lead you to believe.
  2678: Let it go, Mr. Insecurity. I had some other questions...
  2679: What a wonderful command of the language you have. I'll see you later, Myron.
  2685: A city to the northeast. Buncha "genetically pure" humans. They got their
    noses so high in the air they'll drown when it rains.
  2686: Well, I didn't learn at Vault City. I just pick this stuff up. It's pretty
    easy, really.
  2687: Interesting. I had some other questions...
  2688: What a wonderful command of the language you have. I'll see you later, Myron.
  2004: What the hell are you talking about?
  2001: This sucks.
  2033: Beats me.
  2023: I'd sooner lick Marcus's balls.
  2024: I'd sooner lick Lenny's wrinkled balls.
  2025: I'd sooner let that cyber-dog bite off my testicles.
  3000: Myron, I think we need to discuss...distance.
  3001: Let's talk about your gear for a second.
  3002: Forget I brought it up. Keep the same distance.
  3003: I need you to take off that armor you're wearing.
  3004: What weapons are you skilled with Myron? Any?
  3005: Nevermind, there's something else I needed from you.
  3025: Whatever.

    I was holding Sandy behind me, trying to keep her from the monster that had shot Rand. He stood
     next to my husband's body and laughed at me as he aimed his gun at my head. Suddenly, this huge claw
     came out of the darkness, grabbed him from behind and... well, thank goodness that Sandy didn't see
     what happened next. Anyway, the raiders were being wiped out by this group of deathclaws. The one that
     saved Sandy and me stood near us and talked to me. He kept reassuring me that I was safe, and that he
     was sorry that he couldn't have gotten there sooner to help us. Afterwards, the deathclaws brought us
     here.

    I don't know any more about them than you do, I guess. I'm still trying to get used to

  136: Na, me used to it.
  137: Yes it is, in a lot of ways.
  138: No, I've come to accept it.
  139: |-
    After I left the Squat I didn't know what to do with myself. I figured I'd just drift into
     another town and another hired gun job... so I was wandering the desert trying to decide exactly where
     I should go. Well, one day I was looking for a good place to camp. It was getting late, and I didn't
     want to be out in the open after dark. Off in the distance a ways, I thought I saw a campfire -- so I
     decided to see who was there.
  140: Wow.
  141: That's interesting.
  142: |-
    When I let you by me in the Squat, I broke my contract with my employer. I was sure that I'd be
     hunted down and killed because of it. Seeing you here convinces me that I don't have to worry about
     that. I can only assume that my previous employer is no longer in any condition to be concerned with me
     or my whereabouts.
  143: You safe now. Dalia no worry.
  144: You're safe now, Dalia. You'll have no need to worry about any retribution.

  152: 'I have no quarrel with you. '
  153: ". I hope everything worked out for you at the Squat."
  154: |-
    So, I sneak up on this camp site and there are these two deathclaws sitting around the fire just
     chatting away. Idiot that I am, I let out a little cry of surprise, jumped up, and turned to run -- right
     into the arms of another deathclaw standing right behind me. Anyway, to make a long story short, it
     took awhile for me to realize that I wasn't about to be put on a spit and barbecued. Instead, I was
     brought here and 'interviewed' by Gruthar. Now I can live here if I want.
  155: ". That takes a load off my mind."

     six ribs. When I was five, my uncle was decapitated by a watermelon.  When I was six, my parents hit me
     in the head with a shovel. When I was seven, I lost my right index finger to my pet rat.

  128: I really don't want to hear this. I think I'll be leaving.
  129: |-
    Well, there I was, traveling through the desert, when suddenly my brahmin falls over dead. About
     then I realized I was low on water and hadn't had a drink in quite a while. Later, my bones began to
     ache, my head started to hurt, my bowels became loose, and I got this rash that just wouldn't go away.
     It was time to sit down and die.
  130: Me... uh... you... You no have wife or child?
  131: You no talk no more. Me go.
  132: I don't want to hear anymore. I've got to get out of here and away from you.
    Bye.
  133: Please tell me that you don't have any children.
  134: Nope.  When I turned twenty-two this strange fungus started to grow on my test...

  136: Stop! I don't want to know!
  137: Oh. Hi. What can I do for you?
  138: Uh, what you story again?
  139: Sorry, me go.
  140: I was wondering if I could hear your tale once again?
  141: Wait a minute, I thought you were someone else.
  142: At last, my time has come. Are you going to kill me now?
  143: Yes.
  144: No.
  145: |-
    When I was eight, my dog Spike got hit by a tractor. When I was nine, my mother lost her arm to a
     rabid brahmin. When I was ten, my sister was torn to bits by a pack of dogs. When I was eleven, my
     grandfather killed himself because I was ugly. When I was twelve, my grandmother killed herself because
     I was ugly. When I was thirteen, my father poked out his eyes with a pitchfork in a drunken stupor.
  146: "When I was fourteen, my brother lost his hand to a wallaby. When I was fifteen,
    my aunt choked to\n death on a chicken bone. When I was sixteen, I lost my cousin
    to a badger. When I was seventeen, I cut\n off my left big toe with a hoe. When
    I was eighteen, my father lost his right leg to the same tractor\n that killed
    my dog. When I was nineteen... "
  147: |-
    Well, there I was sitting in the desert, waiting for the world to swallow my miserable existence,
     when a pack of deathclaws shows up. Well, I'm thinking to myself, this is it. Now I can die. I can wind up
     as a pile of deathclaw shit in the middle of the desert. But no... fate had yet another cruel
     card to play against me.
  148: |-
    You see, the deathclaws didn't kill me. Instead they gave me water, brought me here, gave me
     this room, gave me food, cleaned me up, and now they won't let me leave. I know they're fattening me up
     for some unknown, horrible fate. I keep telling them that I would probably taste better if I was
     leaner, but it does no good. They just smile -- if you can call it that -- and pat me on the head and
     say 'Don't worry, human, things will get better.' Ha! We both know what that means.
  149: |-
    Anyway, to make matters worse, then they started giving me some sort of medication. It was
     making me gassy, so I stopped taking it -- and it's a good thing I did. I think it was some sort of
     'mind control' pill, because I started to feel like things weren't actually as bad as I thought!
     Anyway, that's about it. I'm just waiting for the dinner bell to chime, so that they can feast on my
     bloated body.

    No, my friend, I was not. I left a few months ago to visit the statue of the Vault Dweller
     erected in the central court of the NCR (the New California Republic east of here). When I returned to
     the vault, I found the deathclaws were already here. Needless to say, I was in shock. However, I am
     convinced that they are not responsible for what happened to my fellow citizens. If, by chance, you
     want more information on this matter, you can seek out Goris in the library.
  140: Okay, thanks.
  141: Okay, bye.
  142: I'll keep this in mind.
  143: I don't need you telling me where to go or who to see.
  144: Thank you for your help. I have more questions, though.
  145: |-
    I have lived with the deathclaws for several months now. They seem to be honorable and
     forthright in their dealings with me and the other humans who live here. I trust them and, in time, I
     think you will as well.
  146: Uh... Okay.
  147: Humph. Me go now.
  148: I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.
  149: You can trust the lizards if you want to, but I'll reserve my opinion for now,
    thank you.
  150: Thank you. I need to know more.
  151: My place is here at the Shrine. I will not leave it willingly.
  152: Ah.
  153: Me leave you now.
  154: OK.
  155: You are either dedicated or a dumbass. I vote for dumbass!
  156: Your dedication is admirable.
  157: |-
    You are a rude and verbally abusive individual. Perhaps if one of the guards were present with
     us, you would curb your tongue.
  158: |-
    I warned you earlier that I would not tolerate your abuse. Obviously you have chosen to ignore
     that warning. (Gordon looks towards the door) Guards! To the Shrine, please!
  159: |-
    So you still choose to be an ass. (Gordon motions toward the deathclaw guard) Guard, please take
     out the trash.
  160: Bring on your stooge! I can kick both your asses in the wink of an eye.
  161: Sorry, I'll curb my tongue.
  162: My apologies to you, Gordon. Please forgive my outburst.
  163: I'm sorry. I forgot myself. Please forgive me.
  164: Ooops, sorry.
  165: I've been looking forward to doing some lizard plinking!
  166: Guards! To the Shrine!
  167: "[]"
  168: "[]"
  169: |-
    So, you've returned. Well, I had you removed once and I can have you removed again. Guards! To
     the Shrine! The trash is back!
  170: "[]"
  171: "[]"
  172: Hello again. What can I do for you?
  173: Ask question?
  174: Me been here before? Sorry. Got go.
  175: I wanted to talk with you once again.
  176: Just saying hello.
  177: ". Can I ask you some questions?"
ocgrutha:
  100: You see a large deathclaw. The creature is composed of rippling muscle, sharp
    teeth, and claws.
  101: You see Gruthar, leader of the deathclaws.
  102: |-
    You see the most impressive deathclaw you could imagine. The creature must be unique among its
     kind.
  103: |-
    Do not fear me, human. I do not intend to harm you. I am Gruthar, leader of this deathclaw pack.
     Why have you come here?
  104: Why have you come here?
  105: Uh...
  106: To kick your ass!
  107: How is it possible that a deathclaw can talk... and so well?
  108: I want to know what happened to the people who once lived here.
  109: I'm looking for something called a GECK. I was told I could find one here.
  110: I've been asked to eliminate a den of dangerous deathclaws...
  111: I'm investigating raids on the local brahmin ranches. Do you know anything
    about this?
  112: I think I'll be leaving now.
  113: |-
    You are no idiot, human. I can see the truth of this in your eyes. Please do not try to deceive
     me. I have no patience for such games.
  114: |-
    Very well. If you wish to be thought of as an idiot, then so be it. Return to me if you change
     your mind.
  115: |-
    My apologies. You seem to be intellectually challenged. You are no threat to me or the pack. You
     are welcome here, and may consider this place a safe haven from the outside world. Harm no one, stay
     out of trouble, and you will always be welcome here.
  116: |-
    Forgive me. I do not mean to be rude, but I do not see that this is relevant to our conversation.
     I can speak your tongue, I can read your written word. What more needs be said?
  117: I see.
  118: I don't mean to pry, but surely you can understand my interest in this matter.
  119: Yeah, well, how about letting me decide what is or is not relevant?
  120: |-
    Yes, I certainly can. Very well. If we part as friends, human, you should speak with Goris. He
     has more understanding in this matter than I. He can usually be found in the vault library.
  121: Thank you. I look forward to meeting Goris.
  122: I have no intention of adding a deathclaw to my list of friends. Bye!
  123: All right.
  124: |-
    They are gone, human. We did not kill them and take their home. It is not our way to kill. I
     understand that you may not believe me, but I hope that you will judge me by my actions toward you and
     not out of fear or prejudice.
  125: Hey, maybe you figure I can kick your ass?
  126: You seem to be an honorable being, Gruthar.
  127: Yeah, I suppose.
  128: |-
    A geck. Is that not a small lizard... no, wait... that is a gecko. I am sorry, but I do not know
     what a geck is, nor where it can be found.
  129: |-
    Yes, I believe you mentioned this once before. I do not know what a geck is, nor where it can be
     found.
  130: Will you let me in to look for it?
  131: Hey, that small lizard comment was really funny. That a relative of yours?
  132: It's obvious that talking to you is a waste of time. Good-bye.
  133: |-
    To be honest with you, I'm not exactly sure what it is myself. Would it be all right with you if
     I looked for it?
  134: |-
    I am sorry, but I do not allow just anyone to wander these halls. I am responsible for the
     safety of all who live here and I must exercise caution. However, I will look for this geck, and if I
     find it, I will let you know.
  135: |-
    I am sorry, but I do not allow just anyone to wander these halls. I am responsible for the
     safety of all who live here and I must exercise caution.
  136: Look. It's not like you own the place. Maybe I'll look around whether you like
    it or not!
  137: I understand, Gruthar, and I'll respect your wish for privacy.
  138: |-
    I can understand your concern. You don't know me well enough to trust me. What if I could help
     you out somehow, and in return you allow me to look around?
  139: |-
    (Gruthar stares at you intently for a moment.) You would be interested in helping us? Yes, I
     sense little evil in you. Very well, I shall place my trust in you.
  140: |-
    (Gruthar stares at you intently for a moment.) I think not. I can sense the evil in you, human.
     I can not risk the lives of those I protect by taking a chance with you.
  141: Thank you.
  142: Fine. I think a bullet lobotomy is a viable solution to my problem.
  143: Sorry you feel that way, Gruthar.
  144: I'll be leaving, then.
  145: |-
    There are many machines here, machines built by humans. Deathclaw hands can not use these
     machines. However, there is one machine that understands questions. I ask it to run the other machines
     and it obeys. This machine no longer listens. It will no longer run the other machines. We are running
     out of food and water. I have ordered raids on the human lands so that we may survive. I am not proud
     of this and I would put an end to it. If you repair this machine, I will be able to feed my people once
     again. I will gladly stop the raids. Will you agree to this?
  146: Sorry, I have no idea how to fix such a thing.
  147: I'm no tech, but I can give it a try.
  148: Hmm... sounds like the voice recognition module has gone bad on you. Let's
    go take a look.
  149: I've changed my mind. I'll have to think about this some more.
  150: I will do what I can for you.
  151: I refuse to help deathclaws.
  152: |-
    Thank you. The machine is in the vault control center on the third level. If you can repair it,
     please do so. I am placing my trust in you. Please do not betray it.  You are welcome here.
  153: I won't let you down, Gruthar. You have my word on that.
  154: Thanks. I'll get on it.
  155: There really is one born every minute...
  156: |-
    I see... Well, deathclaws are dangerous by nature and great care must be taken when encountering
     them in the wild. However, I am certain that you have noticed that we are an exception. My pack poses
     no threat to you or your human communities. We have evolved beyond our base cousins and wish simply to
     be left alone.
  157: Uh... yeah.
  158: |-
    Your heightened intellect could make you even more of a threat than the average deathclaw,
     Gruthar.
  159: I can see that you are not the savage killers that deathclaws are known to
    be.
  160: |-
    I have spent many sleepless nights, deep in thought, pondering just such issues. I have finally
     come to the conclusion that the burdens and responsibilities associated with the gift of intelligence
     are countless. There are only two choices available to any thinking being. Either accept life as it
     comes and make the best of it for yourself and others, or simply cease to be. I have chosen to accept
     the challenges of life. If this makes me a threat to humankind, then I pity the small mind that finds
     it so...
  161: Yes, well... I may have a small mind but I also have a BIG weapon.
  162: I couldn't agree with you more. I don't think you're a threat, Gruthar.
  163: Uh... yeah. What you said.
  164: |-
    (Gruthar pauses and seems to be carefully considering his response to you) I am sorry to say
     that I ordered the raids on the human lands. I am responsible for the lives of many here. We are
     running out of food, water, and other supplies. Until I can get the situation corrected, I need to take
     what I, a deathclaw, can not ask humans for.
  165: Well, now that I know the source of the raids, I'll just eliminate it!
  166: |-
    I'm sorry to hear that. Is there some way that I may be able to help you so that you can stop
     the raids?
  167: I've heard enough for now. I need some time to think.
  168: I see...
  169: |-
    I am displeased with your decision but I accept it. You may leave, but please return if you
     reconsider.
  170: Done.
  171: Hello
  172: No. I'll get to it, though.
  173: I'm sorry, Gruthar. The voice module has gone bad. I'll have to go get one.
  174: I do not understand the workings of such things but I trust you,
  175: Done.
  176: I shall return, you have my word.
  177: Hello
  178: No, I'm still looking.
  179: Yes, and here it is!
  180: "[]"
  181: |-
    You have restored my faith in humans. I thank you for all that you have done for the pack. Is
     there something that I can do for you in return?
  182: You said you would let me know if you found a geck here. Did you locate one?
  183: |-
    Yes, I am looking for a geck. I have been told that I could find it here. Do you know where it
     is?
  184: No, thank you. I have everything that I need.
  185: Yes, there was a geck in the vault storage room. It is yours with many thanks.
  186: |-
    Yes, there was a geck in the vault storage room. However, it is missing. I am sorry
     that I can not give it to you as a reward for all your generous help.
  187: Thanks!
  188: Uh... that's okay. I'll try to locate one elsewhere.
  189: Hello again, human. I hope that you do not intend to play the fool with me.
  190: I want to apologize and start over, Gruthar.
  191: Sorry, I gotta go.
  192: Uh, me sorry.
  193: Greetings, human. Have you reconsidered? Will you help me?
  194: Hell, no. I just wanted to listen to you butcher the language some more.
  195: No, I don't think so.
  196: Yes, Gruthar. I will help you.
  197: Greetings, friend. Have you examined the machine yet?
  198: Not yet, but I'll get on it.

  207: You're a deathclaw and that means a death sentence... for you, that is!
  208: I'm sorry, Gruthar. Let's talk.
  209: Whatever. I'm gone
  210: No. I am leader here, so I decide. If you do not like this, you can return
    to your human lands!
  211: Blow me!
  212: OK, I'll be going now.
  213: Of course, Gruthar. I forgot myself for a moment.
  214: |-
    I assure you that I was not trying to be funny or toy with you. Please excuse me if I gave you
     that impression. I would help you if I could.

     us will regret it!
  219: I'm sorry; I've been impolite and overstepped my bounds.
  220: Screw you and everyone who looks like you!

    sensitive equipment in here.

  118: What would you like to know?
  119: What you do here?
  120: What all this machine?
  121: Vault have overseer. This overseer room?
  122: You here in vault cause you want be?
  123: What you think about D'claws?
  124: Computer need part. You know where get?
  125: Me know enough. Me go now.
  126: What do you do here?
  127: What's all this machinery for?
  128: Isn't this the vault overseer room?
  129: Are you here in the vault because you want to be?
  130: What do you think about the deathclaws?
  131: The computer needs a part. Do you know where I might be able to get it?
  132: I think I'll be going now.
  133: Well... we're having some computer problems and I'm looking into it. Unfortunately
    my forte is software, not hardware.
  134: What problem?
  135: What's the problem?
  136: Yes, Gruthar mentioned this to me and asked me to take a look. Do you mind?
  137: The voice interface to the mainframe has failed so Gruthar can't give the system
    instructions for running the vault. The food and water processors have already
    shut down. The power systems could very well be next.
  138: Why you no use keebored?
  139: Why not just give it keyboard input?
  140: Well, you see, that's the weird part. The system refuses to accept keyboard
    input. I'm at a loss as to what to do at this point.
  141: Okay me look?
  142: Mind if I take a look at it?
  143: Yes, Gruthar mentioned this to me and asked me to take a look. Do you mind?
  144: Well... no offense, but are you sure you're qualified? Oh, never mind. You
    can't possibly make matters any worse than they already are. Go right ahead.
  145: You can't make matters any worse than they already are. Go right ahead.
  146: Okay, but me ask more questions first.
  147: All right, but I need to ask you a couple of things first.
  148: This is a mainframe computer system and related support devices. From here
    all functions of the vault are remotely controlled.
  149: Uh... what you said.
  150: Ah, I see.
  151: Normally the vault overseer would be stationed here but Vault 13 has been fully
    automated.
  152: Why?
  153: Okay, me ask more.
  154: Why? I mean, isn't that unusual?
  155: I see. Let's change the subject.
  156: I don't know the full story but at one point in the vault's history there was
    a rebellion. The overseer was either killed or overthrown, I'm not sure which.
    Anyway, the leaders of the revolution didn't want to entrust the fate of the people
    to another overseer so they installed this mainframe. The records say it was purchased
    from... oh, what was that name... Ah, I remember, the 'Brotherhood of Steel.'
  157: You tell about Brotherhood?
  158: Can you tell me anything about this Brotherhood?
  159: No, I'm sorry, but I have no information on them. This all happened ages ago
    and I've never found any references to them other than this one. However, it's
    my understanding that the Brotherhood was a military outfit and there are some
    ruins of what appears to be a military base west of here. That may be what's left
    of them.
  160: Ok. Me ask other thing.
  161: All right. Let me ask you some other things then.
  162: Oh yeah. I've liked it here ever since I stumbled upon the place and I don't
    really want to leave. I've always been a loner and don't much care for people,
    no offense intended.
  163: Me take none.
  164: None taken.
  165: Well... In some ways I admire them for what they are and what they are trying
    to become. In other ways they scare the hell out of me. I don't think I'll ever
    get used to the fact that they are just as smart as I am... well, some of them
    are that smart.
  166: You think they threat to people?
  167: Do you think they are a threat to human society?
  168: Oh, absolutely. They are far superior to us physically and they are our equals
    mentally. That makes them a pretty big threat. However, it all comes down to morals
    and ethics in the end. Fortunately, they seem to be ethical and morally well developed.
  169: Me see.
  170: Yeah, I see what you mean.
  171: Hi there. It's good to see you again. What can I help you with?
  172: Need ask question.
  173: Just say hi. Me go.
  174: I need to ask you something.
  175: Just saying hi.
  176: Well, let's see... I suppose the best place to look would be Vault City since
    they're the most modern place I can think of. You might want to give New Reno
    a try though. They're closer and they do a lot of trading with Vault City.
  177: Thanks.
  178: Thanks for fixing the computer. You've saved all our butts.
  179: I've got better things to do than shoot the likes of you, but everyone needs
    a vacation!
  180: ". Me ask question?"
  181: ". Can I ask you some questions?"
  182: ". I'd be happy to answer some questions."
  183: You should let Gruthar know that you fixed the computer.

    Why, certainly. Hmmm. You'll need to take some of this. I'll apply this balm to the wound.
     Now just lie back and rest for a couple of hours.
  115: Me thank. Bye.
  116: Thanks, Doc. I feel much better.
  117: |-
    Why, certainly. Hmmm. This will take a while, so you'll have to stay here overnight. You'll
     need to take this, drink this -- all of it, I know it tastes foul. Now, just lie back and I'll wake
     you in the morning.
  118: Me feel good. Bye.
  119: Thanks. That did the trick.
  120: |-
    I'm sorry, but I'm not a medical doctor and I can't perform surgery. I would suggest that you
     go to one of the bigger cities and see a surgeon. Try the New California Republic. It's east of here.
  121: Okay. Bye.
  122: All right. Thanks anyway.
  123: What would you like to know?
  124: You prisoner?
  125: You leave here when want?

  130: Can you leave here if you want?
  131: What can you tell me about the deathclaws?
  132: How did you come to be here in the first place?
  133: Thanks for the information. I'll be heading out now.
  134: |-
    No, I'm not a prisoner. I stay because I'm needed here. I've learned to accept the fact that
     some of my patients are deathclaws.
  135: Okay. Need know more.
  136: Thanks. Bye.
  137: That's very commendable of you.
  138: I see.
  139: That's a decision that I can't agree with, but it's your life.
  140: |-
    Yes I can, and often do. I have to collect my herbs from time to time, and I've never been
     stopped. I used to wonder if the deathclaws were secretly following me and whether or not they would
     stop me if I tried to leave. So one day I put the theory to test.
  141: Me got it. Go now.
  142: Need ask more.
  143: You took a foolish chance and you're lucky it paid off.
  144: All right.
  145: Good idea. I'm glad to see it worked.
  146: |-
    Well, let's see... Deathclaws appear to be mutated Jackson's Chameleons, the horned variety.
     There are a lot of similarities still present, but an even greater number of differences. The mutation
     factor is quite high. This species is highly intelligent, about the equivalent of an eight-year-old,
     with some individuals reaching human normal level. Their learning capacity is very high and they are
     capable of abstract thought and reasoning.
  147: Uh... what you said.
  148: Got go now.
  149: Uh-huh.
  150: Wow, I'm impressed with your knowledge.
  151: Sounds like a bunch of hogwash to me.
  152: |-
    I was gathering some herbs one night when a voice called to me out of the darkness. 'I have been
     watching you,' it said, 'and I know that you are a healer. Are you dedicated to your art enough to heal
     someone foreign to you? Someone whom many would consider an enemy?'
  153: Ugh.
  154: Thanks. Me be leave now.
  155: What a waste to be here when you could be helping others.
  156: You are truly a dedicated man who deserves recognition.
  157: Interesting.
  158: I'll not help someone like you. Go away.
  159: |-
    I traveled to another town and stayed there a week or so before returning. When I got back, I was
     warmly welcomed. Gruthar, the pack leader, came to me privately and personally thanked me for coming
     back. No, I am definitely here because I want to be.
  160: |-
    Although they do not have vocal chords, the deathclaws seem to mimic human speech much the same
     as a parrot does. I have yet to discover the exact mechanism behind this, so I am unable to say more at
     this time. Socially, they are pack animals with a very rigid code of ethics. They are led by an 'alpha
     male' who rules with the mutual consent of the pack. They appear to be extremely loyal to the pack as a
     whole, treating it as a family unit rather than having individual families as humans do.
  161: |-
    Their sense of right and wrong is very well defined. They do follow a code of ethics that is
     enforced by the pack as a whole. Violence is never used as a solution to a problem among the pack as
     far as I can see. There have been no 'capital crimes' committed here, so I can't say how those are
     handled. Hmmm. That's about all I can think of for now. I hope this helps you.
  162: |-
    I answered that I respected all life and would do my best to heal the injured, regardless of who
     or what they were. I thought it was some thief or raider who had gotten himself hurt and needed
     a doctor. You can't begin to imagine my surprise when a couple of deathclaws stepped out of the
     night with an injured companion. Somebody had shot him up real good. I told them I couldn't work on him
     where we were, so they blindfolded me and brought me here. I've been here from that day forward.
ocjul:
  100: You see a deathclaw. It watches you with strangely intelligent eyes.
  101: You see Jul, the deathclaw.
  102: |-
    You see a typical deathclaw. The creature is huge, with a powerful body, sharp teeth, and long
     claws.
  103: Stop. You not go here. This place off limits.
  104: Okay. Me go.
  105: What this place?
  106: Who you?
  107: All right, I'll leave
  108: I go where I please, lizard breath!
  109: What is this place?
  110: Who are you?
  111: This hatchery. Pack mother inside. Eggs inside. I guard. All of pack guard.

  119: Me
  120: Me go now.
  121: Guard mother important job. You important.
  122: I'm
  123: Guarding mother is a position of great responsibility. You must be an important
    pack member.
  124: I guess I'll be leaving now.
  125: You wait. I ask mother.
  126: Okay.
  127: |-
    Mother say she talk to you. You go in. You not cause trouble. I not want hurt you, but I hurt
     you bad if you cause trouble.

    Mother say she talk to you. You go in but you go alone; friends stay here. You not cause
     trouble. I not want hurt you, but I hurt you bad if you cause trouble.
  129: Okay.

    you.

  132: Me want talk mother.
  133: You're welcome. I've got to go now.
  134: May I talk to mother?
  135: |-
    Lizard breath... Oh, I get it. Ha ha! Now you get this. I guard here because I meanest,
     toughest, ruthless son of bitch in whole damn vault. Screw with me, you screw with best.
     You leave here or I rip you head off and make you watch me crap down throat.
  136: I'll be going now.
  137: Oh yeah? Let's see just how tough you are!
  138: It you again. What you want?
  139: Me say hi. Me go.
  140: Who you say you be?
  141: What this place?
  142: Just dropped by to say hello.
  143: What is this place?
  144: Who are you again?
  145: You already dead. You just too dumb to fall over.
  146: ". Me want talk mother."
  147: ", Jul, and I'd like to talk to the mother, please."
ockerith:
  100: You see a deathclaw.
  101: You see Kerith, the deathclaw mother.
  102: |-
    You see a typical deathclaw. The creature is huge, with a powerful body, sharp teeth, and long
     claws. This one appears to be female but you can not tell with any certainty. You notice the scars of several injuries on her torso.
  103: A human visitor is an unexpected but not unwelcome event. I am Kerith.
  104: What can I help you with?
  105: You D'claw mother?
  106: Who D'claw father?
  107: Door look like crap. What happen?
  108: Who build nest room?
  109: Me go now.
  110: So, you are the deathclaw mother?
  111: Who is the deathclaw father?
  112: What happened to the door? It looks like it has seen better days.
  113: Who built this hatchery?
  114: I'll be leaving now.
  115: Yes. I am the current pack mother. After my eggs hatch, the other mothers will
    have their turn.
  116: Okay.
  117: Other mothers?
  118: I see.
  119: There are other mothers?
  120: |-
    Yes, there are more mothers. Should anything happen to me, one will be chosen to take my place.
     The pack must survive.
  121: Uh, me understand.
  122: I understand.
  123: |-
    These eggs were sired by Gruthar, the pack leader. It is Gruthar who decides who will mate and
     who will not. The pack will be made strong by Gruthar.
  124: Uh, okay.
  125: Hmmm. I see. Selective breeding to improve the strain.
  126: |-
    That is a painful memory. A treacherous human sneaked in here and planted a bomb among the eggs
     while I was asleep. Fortunately he was not as stealthy leaving and I awoke to find the bomb. There was
     not enough time to deal with the device properly, so I threw it at the door and placed myself between
     it and the eggs. The eggs and I survived. The door did not.
  127: What happen to human?
  128: How get by guard outside?
  129: Me got more questions.
  130: What happened to the person who did this?
  131: How did this person get by the guard outside?
  132: I have some more questions.
  133: |-
    His name is Matt, and he is a prisoner here. Personally, I wanted him dead -- but Gruthar would
     not allow it. I do not see the wisdom in this, but Gruthar's word is law and he will be obeyed. Should
     you talk to this human, take care. He can not be trusted!
  134: How get by guard outside?
  135: Okay.
  136: How did this person get by the guard outside?
  137: Okay.
  138: |-
    The guard was added after this incident occurred. We were more trusting back then. Now we are
     more careful.
  139: What happen to human?
  140: Me got it.
  141: What happened to this person?
  142: I see.
  143: |-
    We built the cave portion, and a human friend installed the door. He got the parts from a settlement
     north-east of here.
  144: That nice.
  145: That's nice.
  146: Hello again. It is good to see you. What can I help you with?
  147: Me just say hello. Me go now.
  148: Just saying hi. I'll be going now.
  149: It saddens me to have to kill you.
ocmatt:
  100: You see a tall, slender man.
  101: You see Matt.
  102: |-
    You see a tall, slender man with short hair and a wild look in his eye. You can feel him staring
     back at you.
  103: Is there something that I can help you with, stranger?
  104: Me ask questions?
  105: No, wavy.
  106: Yes, I'd like to ask you some questions.
  107: No, I'll be leaving.
  108: What do you want?
  109: Who you?
  110: You prisoner?
  111: Me go now.
  112: Who are you?
  113: Are you a prisoner here.
  114: I'll be leaving now.
  115: My name is Matt. Does it matter?
  116: Guess not.
  117: Humph. Me go.
  118: Okay, I'll just leave.
  119: Not really.
  120: |-
    Yes, as a matter of fact I am. I stumbled upon this place and got myself captured by the deathclaws.
    They give me freedom of movement within the lower levels of the vault, but I can never go to level 1 where the exit is.
  121: Why?
  122: Okay.
  123: Me outta here.
  124: Why?
  125: I see.
  126: I'll be going now.
  127: |-
    Because, unlike the rest of the sheep who live here, I recognize them as a threat to humanity.
     They know that if I get out of here I will see to it that they are wiped off the face of the earth!
     Look: They can think for themselves, they can learn, they can read and even write if they dip a claw
     in ink. They are fast, tough, perceptive, and deadly. If their numbers grow large enough, they will be
     the greatest threat that the human race could ever face. Think about it. They need to be eliminated!
  128: Hmm. You make sense.
  129: Me think you wrong.
  130: I realize that they are a potential threat, but I trust them.
  131: You do have a point. What should we do?
  132: Alone I don't stand a chance, but together we can fight our way out of here.
    How about it?
  133: Yes.
  134: No.
  135: Arrgh! You're a fool to trust them. If you change your mind come back and get
    me.
  136: Bye.
  137: Have you changed your mind? Will you help me get out of here?
  138: Yes.
  139: No.
  140: You seem to have bought yourself a shit storm!
  141: Me not here about escape. Me here because someone break computer. You do?
  142: I'm not here to talk about escape plans. Someone sabotaged the mainframe computer
    interface. Know anything about that?
  143: You seem to have bought yourself a shit storm!
  144: Yeah. I destroyed the voice module and then I disabled all keyboard input.
  145: Why?
  146: With the mainframe offline the vault will eventually shut down. Without food
    or water the deathclaws will be forced to begin raiding human lands for their
    needs. Eventually they will be discovered and their threat to humanity can be
    dealt with.
  147: Others here. They need food, water. You no care about them?
  148: What about the others who live here. Aren't you concerned with their fate?
  149: Not in the least. They are simply casualties of war.
  150: Me go now.
  151: Me think me shoot you now.
  152: Good job.
  153: I see. I'll be going now.
  154: I think I'll shoot you now. You are obviously dangerous.
  155: Good job!

    You see a small girl wearing a yellow dress with flowers on it.  She appears to be meowing like
     a cat.  She has on a name tag that says "Sandy".

    What are you?

     name?
  109: Never mind.

  122: Are you forced to stay here?
  123: Do you like it here?
  124: Are you safe here?
  125: Never mind. Bye
  126: |-
    Yeah. My mom always tells me where I can and can't go. She tells me where I can play and when
     to eat and when to go to bed and when to go potty and when to go to school and everything. I don't think
     it's fair that she can do anything she wants but I've gotta do what she says all the time.
  127: Ok.
  128: Me got leave now.
  129: I see.
  130: I think I've heard enough for now. Bye.
  131: |-
    I guess. I miss not having other kids to play with but Mom says that will change some day. She
     thinks other kids will come to live here. Until they do I like to play with Valdis. He's funny and he
     gives me piggy back rides. Mom says I should leave Valdis alone. He's busy and doesn't have time to
     play but he always plays with me when I ask him. I just don't tell Mom about it anymore.
  132: Piggy... (confused puppy look)
  133: Me go.
  134: That's nice.
  135: Ok, see ya.
  136: Yeah. Mommy takes care of me and Valdis wouldn't let anyone hurt me. I'm safe
    here.

  128: Intruder. Human, deathclaw, whatever. Pack threatened, I attack.
  129: Ah.
  130: I see.

    You examine the computer terminal, but cannot find anything obviously wrong with it. What do
     you do?
  104: Hit it in that 'special' way.
  105: Kick it in that 'special' spot.
  106: Run the diagnostic program.
  107: Open it up and look inside.

  109: |-
    You gaze at the console for a while and decide upon the best spot to place a punch. After giving
     it your best 'this'll fix it' hit, the monitor flashes a couple of times and then stabilizes. There is
     no other effect.

    What do you do?

  111: Run the diagnostic program.
  112: Open it up and look inside.
  113: Leave it alone.

    This well-known repair method produces two results. First, the monitor seems to go haywire for
     several seconds and then stabilizes. Second, you hear a breaking metal type of sound and the panel you
     kicked falls to the floor. What do you do?
  115: Run the diagnostic program.
  116: Damn thing's open. Might as well look inside.
  117: Leave it alone.
  118: |-
    You are certain that the system should have a set of diagnostic routines available. However, the
     keyboard input seems to have been disabled. The unit accepts voice commands only. What do you do?
  119: The only thing left is to look inside.
  120: Leave it alone.
  121: |-
    Peering into the mass of cables and circuit boards, you find that the system has been deliberately sabotaged.
     One of the circuit boards, the voice recognition module, is beyond repair and must be replaced.
     Now all you need to do is find a replacement module.
  122: Done.
  123: Done.
  124: You install the module in the terminal. The system is repaired.
  125: The terminal needs a voice recognition module installed before it can become
    operational.
  126: Done.
  127: The system is working fine now.
  128: Accessing security footage, loading holographic playback...
  129: You are the last, Gruthar. The stain of your kind will soon be wiped clean.

  131: Whatever. You were never anything more than a talking animal.
  132: That may be, but we were created through your experimentation. Your gave us

    Vault 13, I see. You've been doing your country an invaluable service.
  120: President? Who are you anyway?
  121: A service to my country? Just what's going on here anyway?
  122: Uh, I guess I took a wrong turn on my way to the lab. Sorry, sir. Goodbye.
  123: Hello, doctor. Do you have a report? Good news, I hope. Our salvation is in
    your team's hands.
  124: You there, shouldn't you be working on the Project? Mankind's salvation depends
    on you.
  125: Who're you?
  126: Salvation? Just what's going on here?
  127: Sorry, sir. Wrong turn on my way back to the lab. Goodbye.
  128: Oh, that's quite all right. All those inoculation shots would disorient anyone.
  129: Inoculation shots? What do you mean?
  130: I guess I do feel a bit groggy. But knowing that I'm helping my country makes
    it all seem worthwhile.
  131: You can say that again. Well, I better get going.
  132: Let me get one of the Secret Service to escort you back.
  133: That's kind of you but I think I can make it on my own. Goodbye.
  134: That would be nice of you. Thanks.
  135: It's no problem at all. (talking to intercom) Hello. I could use a little assistance
    here.
  136: Uh. Gee, thanks sir.
  137: You better not call your guards if you want to leave this room alive.
  138: Ah...well. I'm sure we can work something out. What's on your mind?
  139: I want to know what's going on here.
  140: I just want to leave quietly. Keep your hand off the alarm until I'm out of
    here. Or else….
  141: I'm leaving here and taking you as a hostage to make sure my people get out
    safely.
  142: Do you really think you can intimidate the President of the United States?
  143: Without a doubt.
  144: Maybe not, but I suggest you stay out of my way until I leave.
  145: For your information, the guards have orders to shoot me rather than let anyone
    or anything endanger the Project. I... wouldn't be of any use as a hostage.
  146: You don't really expect that to work do you? Ha! If you try it, my guards have
    orders to shoot me rather than let anything, or anyone, endanger the Project.
    I'm staying right here. Now, are you going to shoot me or not?
  147: Maybe not, but I'm leaving. Don't touch that buzzer.
  148: The Project? What Project?
  149: Yes, it will. I'll enjoy it.
  150: Uh, now, now, now. Now, let's...let's... Uh, Wh-wh-what is it you want, anyway?
  151: I want to know what's going on here.
  152: I want to know just who the hell you are.
  153: I want you dead.
  154: Okay, okay, whatever you say. I'll just sit here quietly. It's, uh, nice to
    meet you. Goodbye.
  155: That's too easy. Before I go, I'd like to know just what you're doing here.
  156: Watch yourself.
  157: Nice to meet you, Mr. President. Goodbye.
  158: Ahhh. Ahhh. Guards? Guards!
  159: Say goodnight, Mr. President.
  160: I am the President of the United States of America. The Vice-President is in
    the office outside. If you belonged here you'd know that.  Who are you and what
    are you doing here?
  161: You're the President of what United States?
  162: You're a loony.
  163: Vice-President? You mean that drooling idiot next door?
  164: What a coincidence, I'm Emperor of the planet Quetzl, here for the surrender
    of Earth.
  165: I'll just let you get back to business Mr., uh, President. Goodbye.
  166: Ah-ha. Oh, of course, your eminence. Why don't I just call for... some refreshments?
    We can talk and work things out - can't we all just get along?
  167: That sounds just grand.
  168: Nice try, Mr. President.
  169: Uh, well, just one second. (into intercom) Ahh, I'd like refreshments for myself
    and an *unexpected guest*. A very important - unexpected - guest. Right away?
  170: Thanks. I guess you're not such a bad guy after all.
  171: That was stupid. Now someone's going to have to get hurt.
  172: 'Somebody''s loony here, all right. Oh yeah. Oooooh yeah. '
  173: Don't look at me. I'm not claiming to be the President of a United States that
    fell long before either of us was born.
  174: I am the elected representative of the people. The United States does still
    exist. God bless us, every one. We've just had to adapt in order to survive after
    the war.
  175: I don't understand. What do you mean?
  176: You really don't know, do you? Let me tell you about mankind's salvation.  A
    little history first...
  177: A little history….
  178: Go on, Mr. President….
  179: First, why do you have a base at Navarro?
  180: Before you get into that…I saw some of your vertibirds doing some trade with
    New Reno. What's that all about?
  181: I don't have time for this lunacy now. Goodbye.
  182: Well, hello there. Glad to make time for one of our gallant troopers. But,
    I am rather busy. So, uh, what can the President of the United States of America
    do for you?
  183: You're back? What is it you want?
  184: You can tell me just what's going on here.
  185: I, uh, I'm just checking this area, sir. Security check. Yeah. Everything's
    fine here. Uh, goodbye.
  186: Hello. I'm the President of the United States of America, and you are…?
  187: Hello there. I'm the President of the United States of America and I must say
    I've seldom seen a stranger, or sorrier, delegation of misfits in all my life.
    Just who are you to barge in on me this way?
  188: I'm damn curious as to what's going on here.
  189: I'm your executioner.
  190: The President? What are you talking about?
  191: I'm lost. I can see you're a busy man Mr. President. I'll just be leaving now.
    Goodbye.
  192: That's a shame. A conversation with a genuine mutant like you? It'd certainly
    paint me a picture of what life's like in that radioactive hell on the mainland.
  193: Mutant? Why are you calling me a mutant?
  194: Radioactive hell? You don't get out much, do you?
  195: That's it. Enough talk. Time to die.
  196: Yeah, well, we all have to learn to live with disappointment. Goodbye.
  197: There was a great war long before we were born. Our gallant soldiers fought
    from the Yukon to the Yangtze.
  198: Yeah, I knew about that part. Go on.
  199: Vice-President Bird may look like a drooling idiot, but I'll have you know
    that man's a national hero.
  200: To you, probably.
  201: He's one of the bravest men I know. He volunteered to try one of the early
    versions of the F.E.V. toxin antidote. (sigh) Unfortunately, it didn't quite work
    out the way we'd hoped.
  202: You mean that wasn't what you'd hoped for?
  203: It's tiny mocking minds like yours that prove the superiority of real humans
    over mutants.
  204: He's still a gibbering idiot.
  205: Why are you calling me a mutant?
  206: He may yet come around. In fact, there may even be some unforeseen benefits.
    His spelling ability has actually improved.
  207: I'm happy for you. But why  did you call me a mutant?
  208: Because you are. Your tribe's DNA has changed since your ancestor left the
    vault. Unavoidable. All that background radiation you've been exposed to.
  209: OK, so I'm a mutant. Guess what smart guy, you're about to become a dead pure-strain
    human.
  210: So we're mutants. So what.
  211: Creatures change all the time. It's called evolution. Without that change you
    and I would still be two bits of protoplasmic goo.
  212: We try to keep ourselves safe and secure from radiation. That's what separates
    humans - like me - from mutants like you.
  213: Why do you keep calling me a mutant?
  214: Enough talk. Time for you to face that great electoral college in the sky.
  215: I've killed men for less than that. But I'm in a hurry today. Goodbye.
  216: We were winning, too. And then those damn Reds launched everything they had.
    We barely got our birds up.
  217: Doesn't seem as though it helped us much.
  218: Well, no it didn't. But at least it knocked the damn Red menace back into the
    stone age.
  219: And us with it.
  220: 'Well, no. No... not quite. You see, we had planned ahead. We were ready. '
  221: What do you mean?
  222: We had a number of sanctuaries that would enable the glorious American civilization
    to endure. These facilities - the vaults  - were part of the great plan.
  223: Those damn vaults didn't work the way they were supposed to. A lot of people
    in them died.
  224: 'Actually, they worked almost exactly the way they were supposed to. You might
    call it a social experiment on a grand scale. '
  225: An experiment?
  226: The vaults were set up to test humanity. Some had not enough food synthesizers,
    others had only men in them, yet others were designed to open after only 6 months.
    They each had a unique set of circumstances designed to test the occupants.
  227: What about Vault 13? What was it's purpose?
  228: Ahh. Vault 13 was a special case. It was supposed to remain closed until the
    subjects were needed. Vault 13 was, in scientific parlance, a control group.
  229: But they would all have died if my ancestor didn't get them a replacement water
    chip. That doesn't seem to fit in with your plan.
  230: An unfortunate, and unforeseen, accident. However, as it turns out, a rather
    fortuitous one.
  231: What do you mean?
  232: As it turns out we needed test subjects from untainted, pre-war, human stock
    - your ancestors in Vault 13 - and some freshly mutated stock - the villagers
    from Arroyo.
  233: Why?
  234: For the Project. It's almost ready. Humanity's salvation is almost at hand
    and the United States of America will be the progenitor of that rebirth.
  235: Rebirth? What do you mean?
  236: The only way for true humans, and democracy, to be safe is to cleanse the mutants
    from the globe. We humans will take back that which is rightfully ours.
  237: The Project will cleanse all the mutants from our fair land - and the rest
    of the globe. Once again, America will be the world's policeman.
  238: I'm a true human, too.
  239: Cleanse the mutants? That sounds a bit drastic. How are you going to do that?
  240: We found a research facility in operational shape about 70 years ago. A former
    military base that had been used to research a special virus.
  241: A virus?
  242: Yes, the F.E.V. virus. It was originally developed to turn soldiers into super-warriors
    but it failed. The warriors were tough and strong, but far too stupid. However,
    our brilliant Chemical Corps altered it.
  243: Altered the virus? Why?
  244: To turn it into a staggeringly effective killer. Any humanoid that isn't inoculated
    against its effects before its release, will die. That is the Project.
  245: That's insane.
  246: No, no. That's humanity's last, best, hope. That's what we've been working
    towards all these years.
  247: Great, so you have all this poison and no way to spread it around.
  248: We've run short of certain critical chemicals. We can get them from the drug
    labs of New Reno. If the mutant-mobsters use our guns to kill each other, just
    saves us the trouble.
  249: Everything works in your favor, huh? Tell me the rest of the story.
  250: Simple. Navarro is an isolated base. Our vertibirds have a limited range. They
    refuel there.
  251: Makes sense.
  252: I'm sure you think so. But tests performed on your tribesmen have all shown
    that you are guilty of mutation. It's a damn good thing the Project is ready.
  253: Why?
  254: Some of the members of your tribe are showing some extremely interesting changes.
    If the danger to true humanity weren't so great I would think about studying them.
    But that's not to be.
  255: Not to be? Why not?
  256: Oh, but that's one of the advantages of the F.E.V. virus. We can release it
    right here and the jetstream will carry it worldwide. It'll have plenty of time
    to cleanse every nook and cranny of the globe.
  257: OK. Then why did you have to kidnap my villagers and the people from Vault
    13?
  258: Test subjects. Your villagers are all descended from vault stock and we had
    to make sure that the F.E.V. toxin was still effective. The subjects from Vault
    13 test that and an inoculation against the FEV.
  259: You're not testing the inoculation on my people?
  260: It's hardly necessary. I'm sure we could and it would work, but there's no
    reason to do so.
  261: Did it ever occur to you that what you're doing is wrong?
  262: Never. Part of the president's job is to make the tough decisions. A lot of
    near-humans will sacrifice their lives for the return of humanity. Humans will
    prevail.
  263: There's no way in hell that I can let you do this.
  264: Just because everyone out there doesn't have an exact copy of your DNA that
    doesn't give you a license to exterminate them.
  265: You can't stop it. The tests are complete and the toxin is ready for release.
    In hours, your villagers will be the first to make the ultimate sacrifice. The
    other mutants will follow. An unfortunate footnote in the continuing history of
    the human race.
  266: Why don't we start that footnote off with your epitaph, Mr. President?
  267: Oh, I don't relish this decision. If there was another way- but there isn't.
    No price is too high for the survival of the human race. If you were human, you'd
    feel the same way.
  268: You really believe that, don't you?
  269: Yes, I do. Even killing me won't help you. There's nothing you can do to stop
    the release.
  270: Maybe I'll just figure out a way to give you a taste of your own medicine.
  271: We'll just see about that. I've got things to do. Goodbye, President Richardson.
  272: I disagree, Mr. President. I think killing you will help. I'll feel a lot better.
  273: You could try, I suppose, but soon the staff of the Enclave and Navarro will
    be inoculated.
  274: They aren't already?
  275: We just have to distribute the supplies. A matter of hours. Besides, the Enclave
    is a sealed unit. No air or contaminants get in or get out.
  276: We'll see. In the meantime, I'm taking you out of the picture, personally.
  277: You might find that tougher than you think. If you do, I'll go to my reward
    knowing that I died a patriot and a servant of humanity.
  278: Time for your reward.
  279: Right now, I'll let you think about your coming death. Don't touch the alarm.
    Goodbye.
  280: 'Very moving. But the radical changes your villagers and other mutants show
    is a far cry from the gradual changes of natural evolution. '
  281: Maybe we're changing into a better version of the human race. Did you ever
    think of that?
  282: 'Very possible, indeed. In which case, our mission is even more vital to the
    survival of the human race. '
  283: Huh? What do you mean by that?
  284: That's the spirit. God bless America. You should probably get back to your
    isolation ward now, though.
  285: Uh, yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir.
  286: Oh, I'll be able to find my own way back, sir. Goodbye.
  287: Why, against the F.E.V. toxin, of course. Damn brave sacrifice you and the
    other members of Vault 13 are making. On behalf of the United States government,
    and all humanity, I thank you. Now, we better get you back to your ward.
  288: F.E.V. toxin? What the hell are you talking about? What's going on here?
  289: Uh, yes sir. Whatever you say, sir.
  290: Oh, I'll be able to find my own way back, sir. Goodbye.
  291: So what? If your kind is allowed to flourish it'll mean the end of the human
    race as we know it. We can't allow radioactive freaks to squeeze humans into extinction.
  292: I think you're overestimating things a bit.
  293: Not at all. Look to the future. Sure muties and men could get along for a while,
    but before you know it, the numeric pressure of your kind would tell. No, a line
    must be drawn in the sand - the buck stops here.
  294: What do you intend to do about this so called threat?
  295: I don't have time to listen to your bigoted, mad ravings. Goodbye.
  296: The government of the United States of America has been working towards a solution
    for quite some time.
  297: How so? What are you doing here?
  298: I assure you, I'm quite sane, as is everyone on the Project. We're dedicated
    to the salvation of the human race. You can call single-minded dedication to a
    cause madness, I suppose, but if so, it's divine madness.
  299: What are you talking about? What are you doing here?
  300: How about my single-minded dedication to killing you right now?
  301: You're mad. I don't have time for your lunacy right now. Goodbye.
  302: I don't think this tired old planet's big enough for two top dogs. If it's
    us or you…. Well, I'm going to choose us.
  303: I don't think you get to make that kind of choice.
  304: As the embodiment of the executive branch, I bear the burden of ensuring the
    survival and prosperity of the United States and of humanity itself. A heavy burden
    and yet if it means the return of the earth to our children and to their children,
    I bear it gladly.
  305: How do you intend to do that? What are you doing here?
  306: Let me remove your burden. Permanently.
  307: It must be nice in your dimension. See you later,  Mr. Nutcake.
  308: To the North
  309: To the Northwest
  310: To the West
  311: To the Southwest
  312: To the South
  313: To the Southeast
  314: To the East of here
  315: To the Northeast
  316: 'Yes'
  317: 'No'
  318: Ouch
  319: "(cry of pain)"
  320: Why are you talking to me like that?
  321: I don't know anything about that.
  322: You're not very nice.
  323: 'Thank-you. '
  324: This is good.
  325: This isn't good.
  326: I have a good feeling about this.
  327: I have a bad feeling about this.
  328: You people are crazy.
  329: What are you talking about?
  330: Is everyone else crazy here?
  331: There must be another way.
  332: Come here.
  333: I don't understand.
  334: I don't know.
  335: That hurts.
  336: That really hurts.
  337: That's got to hurt.
rcfannie:
  100: You see a rather worn-looking woman.
  101: You see Fannie Mae, one of the hostesses at the Malamute Saloon.
  102: You see a woman who shows more wear from mileage than from years.
  103: |-
    (Fannie looks distinctly unhealthy as she wobbles towards you) Hey there, lover. I'm feeling a
     little under the weather lately. Want to give me some money for a quick boost? I can make it worth your
     while. (grins)
  104: |-
    (Fannie looks distinctly unhealthy as she wobbles towards you) Hey there, sister. Can you spare
     a few bucks to help a gal who's down on her luck? Just 'til I get back on my feet again.
  105: |-
    (Fannie doesn't look very well at all) Hey there, pal. Ready for a li'l fun with Fannie?
     Half-price for you, lover. Where'd I put my Jet?
  106: |-
    (Fannie doesn't look very well at all) Hey there, lady, spare some money? Or a bit o' Jet fuel
     even?
  107: Fannie, you look like hell. Why don't you lay off the Jet for a while?
  108: I think you've enjoyed enough of my charity, and it didn't seem to help you
    at all.
  109: You've had enough for now.
  110: Why don't you just sleep it off?
  111: |-
    Jet's the only thing that makes me fly. ./~Come fly with me ./~ Give me a little something
     special, won'tcha?
  112: |-
    Oh, you're just full of great ideas now, aren't you. Well, I don't need you. Plenty of people
     still want to pay for Fannie's charms. If you won't give me money for Jet, then just get out of my
     sight.
  113: I have something that should cure you of that reliance on Jet.
  114: Find yourself another sucker, Fannie. Goodbye.
  115: |-
    You're going to kill yourself if you keep on this way. I don't want to watch you do that.
     Goodbye.
  116: Ain't you a sight.
  117: Fannie don't flop for no morons.
  118: Come back with some money and maybe Fannie can learn you something.
  119: You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are ya?
  120: You're 'bout as smart as bait. Ain't ya?
  121: |-
    A cure? What, are you crazy? Do I look like I want to be cured? You want to make me feel better,
     sugar? Give me some more Jet.
  122: Well, I guess just a little more to get you by wouldn't hurt. Here's some Jet.
  123: |-
    You've already had more than enough Jet. Last thing I need to do is watch another Jet reliant.
     Goodbye.
  124: If I had any Jet, I'd be using it myself. Goodbye.
  125: Yeah, that's what I need. Oh yeah. What a rush. Mmmmm...
  126: Uh, well, I guess I'll just let you enjoy yourself now. Goodbye.
  127: Sounds like you're really Jetted-up, now. I'll see you around. Goodbye.
  128: Hey there, sailor. Come here often? You come here to visit with Fannie Mae?
  129: Hello, sister. Looking for work?
  130: Uh, yeah. I'm here to visit you.
  131: Work? What kind of work?
  132: Uh, I was just looking around. Goodbye.
  133: |-
    Well, aren't you sweet. Acting so bashful and all. It's going to cost you $60 for a visit with
     me, sugah.
  134: Maybe you'll last a bit longer this time, honey. You'll get more of your $60
    worth that way.
  135: Nice and slow, baby. I'll show you a real nice time for your $60.
  136: "$60, huh? Sounds like a good price to me. Here's my money."
  137: Thanks for the offer, but maybe another time would be better. Goodbye.
  138: "$60? I don't think I want to visit you if it's going to cost that much. Goodbye."
  139: |-
    You've been so nice to me. I felt that you really meant something when you did that. (sob) I
     sure wish it was like that all the time.
  140: Well, when you're with me, it is.
  141: You sure know how to talk the talk.
  142: |-
    I don't want to do this anymore. Me an my fella' are going to get away from here and live life
     straight. Just as soon as I can pay off Lou.
  143: Pay off Lou?
  144: Hey, I gave you money already. What are you talking about?
  145: |-
    Yeah, well...I owe Lou some money and I can't leave until I pay her off. But as soon as I do
     (sniff) I'm going to take my beau and get myself as far away from this life as I can. If I could only
     raise a little extra dough.
  146: How much extra money do you need to pay off Lou?
  147: Can't your boyfriend help you out of debt?
  148: |-
    That's a sad story, but you should have the money you need soon enough. As long as you keep your
     back to the mattress, that is. Goodbye.
  149: |-
    All I need now is $200 and I'm in the clear. My man and I are out of here clean and free. No
     more strange, grubby, people pawing at me all day and night. Uh, I didn't mean no offense.
  150: None taken. I don't really paw, do I? Anyhow, I could pay your way out of here.
    Here's $200.
  151: Sounds sad, alright. Well, I guess you'd better get busy then. Goodbye.
  152: |-
    Oh thank you,thank you. I didn't think that there was anyone this kind outside of my
     dreams. You're the best. Thanks again. Hey, want a freebie? On the house?
  153: Why sure, Fannie. I think I'll take you up on that offer.
  154: That's not really necessary, Fannie. Just use the money to get yourself out
    of this life. Goodbye.
  155: |-
    He really wants to, but he's just barely getting by as a miner. We keep hoping he'll make a big
     strike but that hasn't happened yet. And last week a beam fell on him and broke his leg, so he can't
     work. Now I have to give him what little money I can spare 'til he gets better.
  156: Sounds as though you two have had some bad luck. How much did you say you need?
  157: |-
    Thanks again. I can't wait to tell my guy. We'll be out of here as soon as his leg
     heals up.
  158: |-
    That was quite a thank you, Fannie. I just better get myself out of here while I can still walk.
     You're welcome. Goodbye.
  159: It'll be a loss to the profession to see you go, Fannie. Goodbye.
  160: Hey there. You want to spend some time with Fannie?
  161: Didn't I give you some money so you could stop doing this?
  162: Sure, sounds good to me. Good thing I caught you before you left.
  163: Well, yes...but it turns out that I owe Lou more than I thought.
  164: How much more?
  165: I've heard enough of this. Goodbye.
  166: |-
    Uh, I know, and I'm real grateful...but I guess I owed Lou more than I thought. I need more
     money.
  167: I can't believe it! How much more money do you need to get out of this?
  168: Well, you've got all you're going to from me. Good bye.
  169: That's okay, baby. You've already helped enough. (sniff) I only need another
    $150, though.
  170: Well, I guess if that's all you need. But this is it. I mean it.
  171: Yeah, sure. I'm out of here. Goodbye.
  172: |-
    Hey there, you came back. Looking for a little fun, or did you come back to give me some money
     for Lou?
  173: Just here for some fun this time, Fannie. We'll see how it goes.
  174: How much do you need for Lou?
  175: Just stopping by, Fannie. Goodbye.
  176: Always nice to get some repeat business. For you, I'll even change the sheets.
  177: You sure know how to make a guy feel special. Thanks.
  178: Uh, I think I've changed my mind. See you around, Fannie. Goodbye.
  179: You know, back-floppin' work. With looks like yours, I bet you could make a
    good living.
  180: |-
    You know, back-floppin' work. Even the way you look, you could make some money. Those miners
     ain't too particular, ya know.
  181: You think so? Hmm, maybe I should.
  182: I don't think that's for me. Goodbye.
  183: Well it shore helps if'n your nose ain't to keen. Those miners ain't too fond
    of soap and water.
  184: Really? Maybe this isn't for me after all. Thanks for the offer, though. Goodbye.
  185: I don't know how you can stand it, but then I guess you don't. Stand, that
    is. Goodbye.
rndbess:
  100: You startle a flock of vultures feeding off a dead herd of brahmin.
  101: Whew! Nothing worse than flesh rotting out in the hot sun.
  102: Oh my God, it's Bess!
rndexcow:
  100: |-
    You have a funny feeling about this place. The enchanting smell of cow dung and rotting flesh
     emanates a few feet from here.
rndtoxic:
  100: Who did you piss off to get stuck in this?
scbgrd:
  100: You see a someone wearing combat armor.
  101: You see a guard.
  102: He looks to be standing here waiting for something to happen.
  103: Yeah, yeah. Move along.
  104: You make sure you're nice to Mr. Buster so we don't have to waste any ammmo.
  105: I'm here to kick ass and chew bubble gum. Good thing for you I have one stick
    left.
  106: What the hell you looking at? Blow.
  107: Hey, I am not in to that. Just make sure you keep a good distance from me.
  108: Yeah, that's right come over to papa. Why don't we meet later for a drink?
  109: Honey, I'd sleep with a brahmin before I looked at you twice.
  110: Just buy something and get the hell out of here.
scbuster:
  100: You see a little grease-stained guy.
  101: You're looking at Buster, the gun guy.
  102: This guy's clothes are ragged and he's got gun-bluing all over his hands, arms,
    and face. Still, he seems pretty cheerful.
  103: Hey, welcome to Buster's Fine Emporium of Armament! I'm Buster and there ain't
    nobody else. Got some fine goods here and on my shelves. Check it out. I'm ready
    to deal.
  104: Hey, back again? What can I do for you?
  105: Anything else?
  106: Want gun.
  107: What do you got?
  108: Maybe you can fix me up something special?
  109: I've got some questions
  110: Goodbye.
  111: A fine choice!
  112: Well, you got yourself a steal there, partner.
  113: Not to rush you, stranger, but I got work to do.
  114: Sure, stranger, what do you want to know?
  115: Tell me about NCR
  116: What's the deal with Merk?
  117: What can you tell me about Frank Westin?
  118: I'm looking for a meeting with Old Man Carlson. Know anybody who could help
    me?
  119: Do you have a GECK?
  120: That's nice stranger, but I ain't no charity.
  121: Maybe. Just might have a Triveld x10 rifle scope - would fit just fine on a
    hunting rifle, if somebody was interested.  Let it go cheap -- $500.
  122: Hey, you already cleaned me out.
  123: Sure, it's a deal
  124: No, thanks.
  125: New California Republic - that's what it is. President Tandi and the bunch
    say they're trying to rebuild the old days; I figure they're just trying to grab
    whatever they can. Hell, I got no complaint with them - the old days is all before
    my time. They're kind of a prissy bunch, though - don't like slaves, gambling,
    whatnot. That's why I set up out here. Don't like rules - never have.
  126: I see.
  127: Goodbye.
  128: I don't mess with Mr. Merk and it don't pay to go gossiping about him. You
    got questions, go ask about him at the Rawhide.
  129: I see.
  130: Goodbye.
  131: Frank Westin? You mean that Congress guy? Got himself a spread out west of
    town.  Brahmin man - big wheel in the Stockman's Association. He's always looking
    for hands, if you're wanting work.
  132: I see.
  133: Goodbye.
  134: Funny you go asking that after what happened to Frank Westin. Not that I'd
    know, but there's a fellow - Merk - down at the Rawhide who might be able to help
    you.
  135: I see.
  136: Goodbye
  137: That one of them pre-war imports? Let me guess, 14mm ammo? Nope, ain't got
    one.
  138: I see.
  139: Goodbye
  140: Look, I can't do this on anything but a hunting rifle. It's the way the mount's
    built, understand?
  141: I see.
  142: Goodbye.
  143: The joint's closed. Bug off.
  144: God! Come back at a decent hour, will ya?
  145: Come back when I'm open - and close the tent flap behind ya.
  146: I'm closed.
  147: Look, just get out or Mr. .45 is gonna get unhappy!
  148: Wrong move, stranger.
  149: Here is what I have on this shelf. If you need anything else make sure to check
    out the other shelves also.
sccargrd:
  100: Yet another guard. Somebody must breed them, since they all look alike.
  101: Still a guard. Probably doesn't like you.
  102: You look at him closely and you're convinced he's a guard.
  103: You're not authorized to be here.
  104: Can I see your pass?
  105: This is government property. Move on, stranger.
  106: So you're the new guy, eh?
  107: If you haven't talked to Carlson, you better do that.
  108: Mr. Carlson's expecting you.
  109: Mr. Carlson will see you now.
  110: I hope this is important. Mr. Carlson is a busy man.
  111: He's inside. I'd suggest not staying too long.
sccarkid:
  100: You see a snot-nosed little kid.
  101: It's Vice-President Carlson's kid
  102: Looks like a spoiled little runt. Fat, too.
  103: My dad's Vice-President Carlson, so you better treat me nice! Who are you?
  104: "[Player name]"
  105: I'm one of your dad's guards.
  106: Where's your dad?
  107: See this knife? I've gutted little kids nicer than you.
  108: I'm your worst nightmare, puke.
  109: Sorry kid, I'm busy.
  110: "? That's a crappy name. You got a stupid name! Stupid name!"
  111: Then you got to be extra nice to me or I'll tell my dad.
  112: Oh? How about I (whisper).
  113: Right. Oh boy.
  114: He's inside. In his office. He's always in there.
  115: Where's his office?
  116: Okay. Thanks.
  117: By the water tank. I play over there sometimes.  I peek on him while he's working.
  118: You're an annoying little brat, aren't you?
  119: Thanks kid, you've been a big help.
  120: You're not a nice man, you're a bad man! I'm going to go tell my daddy!
  121: Hey, it's you again. Whatcha doing?
  122: Go ask your father if I can see him.
  123: Tell you father I have news about Mr. Bishop. Can you remember that?
  124: Fnuh.
  125: You're a poop brain! Poop brain!
  126: Okay.
  127: News about Mr. Mishop. Okay?
  128: Good enough.
  129: Daddy says he can't see you.
  130: I told Daddy that. I think he doesn't like you.
  131: Daddy says you can come in the house.
  132: I told Daddy you were a bad man.
  133: That's right, I'm the boogy man! And I'm gonna eat you.
  134: You got me wrong, kid.
  135: I'm not supposed to talk to you anymore.
  136: My daddy's dead. Why didn't you save him?
sccarlsn:
  100: You seen an elderly, frail man.
  101: It's Vice-President Carlson.
  102: Though physically weak, his eyes reveal a powerful moral strength. This is
    a determined man.
  103: What are you doing here? Guards!
  104: You're not one of my men. Guards!
  105: Get out of here!
  106: I'm incredibly busy. Please come back another time.
  107: Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I need more time to work.
  108: Sorry, I don't have time to meet with you right now.
sccgtgrd:
  100: Yet another guard. Somebody must breed them, since they all look alike.
  101: Still a guard. Probably doesn't like you.
  102: You look at him closely and you're convinced he's a guard.
  103: You're not authorized to be here.
  104: Can I see your pass?
  105: This is government property. Move on, stranger.
  106: You're the one Merk called about? Okay, let him through, boys.
  107: This checks out. Stand aside, boys.
  108: Okay, you're clear. Open the gate, boys.
  109: You're the one Merk called about? Okay, let her through, boys.
  110: I'm on duty. No time for socializing.
  111: Hey, nice shoes.
  112: You should go about your business.
sccop:
  100: You see a person wearing the uniform of the NCR Police.
  101: A cop.
  102: Judging from the unsmiling face, don't expect much mercy here.
  103: Put your weapon away - NOW!
  104: Stranger, we got a no weapon policy in this town. Put your weapon away.
  105: Put the weapon away and nobody'll get hurt.
  106: It's after curfew, stranger. Why don't you head home?
  107: Move along now. There's nothing to see here.
  108: Night's not a good time to be wandering the streets.
  109: Good day, stranger. New in town?
  110: Move along now. There's nothing to see here.
  111: I'm on assignment. If there's trouble you might try reporting it to the sheriff.
  112: Hey, stop tampering with that.
  113: Get away from that.
  114: That is not to be tampered with.
  115: If you don't stop fooling with that I am authorized to shoot you.
scdocjub:
  100: You see an old, kindly looking fellow.
  101: It's Doc Jubilee.
  102: He's an old man with a snow-white beard and a slightly blank stare.
  103: I'm Doc Jubilee. What's wrong, young man?
  104: What's wrong, young man?
  105: Me hurt.
  106: I need a doctor.
  107: Can't you just take some pills or something and stop bothering me with this
    twaddle?
  108: Hell, you're hardly bleeding.
  109: I don't know. Don't think I can save it. We may have to cut that leg off.
  110: You're kidding.
  111: Ha-ha.
  112: There you are, sonny.
  113: Again.
  114: Thanks, Doc. Maybe you can help me out with some answers.
  115: Goodbye.
  116: It'll cost you $50.
  117: Just heal me.
  118: I'm not staying here.
  119: You make better.
  120: Me go now.
  121: Nope. Never joke. Best I cut that leg off before gangrene sets in.
  122: No way you're cuting anything off, understand?
  123: That's it, I'm leaving.
  124: Well, if it festers, don't blame me.
  125: I don't run a charity hospital. You'll need to get some cash before I do anything.
  126: So what can I do for you?
  127: Shoot.
  128: Vault 13?
  129: Know where I could find Vault 13?
  130: I heard somebody saying Mr. Westin's not well. That true? I'm worried something
    might happen to him. He owes me some money.
  131: There's this Saltbeef fellow says you stole a map from him. What's the deal?
  132: I'm looking for a job. Know of any?
  133: Doc, you wouldn't know anything about a group that's fighting those evil slavers,
    would you?
  134: Well you shouldn't worry, son. As long as he doesn't tax his system, he'll
    probably outlast us all. 'Course that's if he'd ever mind my doctoring or his
    medicine.
  135: Well, that's good to know. There's something else I was wondering.
  136: Thanks, doc.
  137: That old drunk! The only thing I ever got from him was my "Velvet Elvii" painting
    - in lieu of cash.
  138: A Velvet Elvii? Could I see it?
  139: Not exactly a map, eh? Well, let me pick your brains on some other things.
  140: Well, I've got to get on.
  141: I ain't heard that mentioned since old Saltbeef was brought in here. Sunstroke.
    Burned with fever for three days, all the time ranting how he'd found Vault 13,
    his mother lode.
  142: Mother Lode?
  143: So where is it?
  144: Where vault?
  145: Couldn't tell you. Saltbeef always claimed he had a map, but nobody's ever
    seen it.
  146: Saltbeef?
  147: Ask more.
  148: Well, that's more than what I had before.
  149: The big one. Saltbeef's an old uranium prospector - more accurately, a drunk.
    Lives out on the Westin spread these days.
  150: Another question...
  151: Thanks for the story.
  152: Well, I was really hoping to get some money for it. I'll let it go for $
  153: Maybe later, another question...
  154: Maybe later, I have to go.
  155: Saltbeef's an old uranium prospector. Lives out on the Westin spread these
    days.
  156: Another question...
  157: Thanks for the story.
  158: You best go talk to President Tandi. I've heard she's looking for a special
    type of person.
  159: Another question...
  160: Thanks.
  161: I might... There is a group set against slavery and- well, most the other vices,
    too. You can sometimes find them over at the big shop, working on some automobile.
  162: Another question...
  163: Thanks.
  164: Hey, get your hands off that, punk!
  165: Careful there! Just takes tiny amout to expose yourself.
  166: Put that back! You could seriously hurt yourself with that stuff.
  167: Those meds are for Mr. Westin, not you. Put them back.
  168: Get away from that. Got to be careful, see. Wouldn't want Mr. Westin getting
    the wrong meds now.
  169: Watch it! I just measured out Mr. Westin's dose.
  170: I'm Doc Jubilee. What's wrong, young miss?
  171: What's wrong, young miss?
  172: There you are, miss.
  173: Well you shouldn't worry, miss. As long as he doesn't tax his system, he'll
    probably outlast us all. 'Course that's if he'd ever mind my doctoring or his
    medicine.
  174: Sure. Here's the $
  175: Thanks, I've been trying to get the money out of Saltbeef, but that bum never
    had any.
  176: "."
scdoroth:
  100: You see a young woman, very much a tomboy, dressed in work overalls.
  101: It's Dorothy, the city engineer.
  102: From all the grease and dirt on her, she's a hands-on tool type, especially
    since that maintainence bot follows her everywhere.
  103: Oh my god, somebody's got to do something! What do I do? I need some help quick.
  104: Huh? Gug?
  105: What's going on?
  106: You come. Stop bad man. Stop him no break machine. Okay?
  107: Okay.
  108: No, no come.
  109: Oh, god, it's Jack. He's threatening to blow up the power plant. There's no
    time, you have to stop him for me. You can do that, can't you?
  110: Stop wasting time. Lead on.
  111: Not my job. Go find somebody else.
  112: Listen - Jack's inside. He's upset about his ex-wife. Things haven't been good
    for him lately. He says he's got a bomb. If so, it's probably right alongside
    the generating dynamo. Look, see if you can talk him out of it, but whatever you
    do don't let that bomb go off!
  113: How am I supposed to do that?
  114: Don't worry, I'm on it.
  115: I don't know! I'm just the city engineer. You figure it out!
  116: Crap! He's damaged the core unit. It's got to be fixed before things really
    go to hell. You any good at repairing things?
  117: Urrgh.
  118: Yes.
  119: 'No'
  120: What was I thinking?
  121: Look, do what you can with the generator. I've got to stablize the core. You've
    got about 30 seconds, I think. After that it'll be too late. Come on, Toto.
  122: Damn! Then stand back. Unless I'm real lucky, the whole thing's going to blow.
    Let's go, Toto.
  123: You fixed it? Without any parts? That's amazing! Where'd you learn to do that?
  124: Huh-huh!
  125: Just handy that's all.
  126: I get it. You're one of those moron types - what do they call them? Idiot savants.
    Well look, idiot or not, you've earned a reward. RE-WARD - you. I give you pretty
    books.  You see. Get money. Good... Not like you can read, after all.
  127: Look, it's not much, but I've got some books - old tech manuals. They're yours.
    Take them.
  128: Hey look, Toto. It's the stranger who helped us out. Thanks again, mister.
  129: Crap! The whole grid's down. This is going to take forever to fix. No time
    to talk. Come on, Toto.
  130: Look, I don't blame you for what happened, but I'm not in a real chatty mood.
  131: You killed him! I mean, did you have to kill him? Wasn't there some other way?
  132: Yes.
  133: No.
  134: You should have tried it then, instead of just killing him. Get out of here,
    you monster!
  135: It's terrible. I wonder what made him do it? The town owes you its thanks.
    Look, it's not much, but here's some manuals I've been collecting. Maybe you can
    sell them or something.
  136: Don't talk to me, you murdering swine.
  137: Can't chat, stranger. Name's Dorothy, city engineer, and that's Toto. Got to
    run.
  138: You don't have an illudium Q-38 space modulator, do you? Didn't think so.
  139: You talked him out of it? That's amazing! The town owes you big, mister. Look,
    it's not much, but here's some manuals I've been collecting. Maybe you can sell
    them or something.
  140: I just want you to know I'm still impressed by what you did with Jack. Me and
    Toto have to run now. `Bye!
  141: Crap! I got one word of advice-RUN!
  142: Hey look, Toto. It's the stranger who helped us out. Thanks again, miss.
  143: You talked him out of it? That's amazing! The town owes you big, sister. Look,
    it's not much, but here's some manuals I've been collecting. Maybe you can sell
    them or something.
  144: Don't waste time! He's serious.
  145: You've got to do something right now!
  146: Don't just stand there -- stop him!
  147: Just get out of here, brahmin dung.
  148: Don't talk to me, you coward.
  149: What use are you!?
scdthcla:
  100: The creatures came from the northeast. It shouldn't be hard to track them back
    to their nest. (Exit Grid to the northeast.)
  101: Wow, this sure is boring. I hope something happens.
  102: Look at the time...
  103: Hmmm, dis is boring.
  104: Zzzz...Zzz... huhh, wah...?
  105: Look - human guard brahmin.
  106: Gruthar say we go. No hurt human.
  107: Look. It
  108: ". We go."
  109: That strange. Bad things talk?
  110: Talking deathclaws? That's weird...
scduppo:
  100: You see a red-faced, friendly looking man.
  101: It's Duppo. He runs the Stockmen's Association.
  102: He's a stocky fellow and with constantly flushed face and shock of thin blond
    hair. He walks with a slight limp.
  103: Greetings, stranger. Don't know you from these parts, so that means you're
    not a rancher. You come looking for work or are you here to buy?
  104: What'll it be, stranger?
  105: Work.
  106: Buy.
  107: Well, my name's Duppo. Ranch supplies and hiring hall, all done right here.
    Gotta say, you don't look like a brahmin puncher. How are you with a gun?
  108: Still looking for some guards, if you're interested.
  109: Heh. Kill.
  110: Good enough.
  111: I'm not into violence.
  112: Well, here's my stock. Make sure to look at all my tables for more inventory.
    If you  don't like what I got, get your ass to that shyster Buster. Of course,
    he'll rob you blind.
  113: Well, sounds like you'll do. We're looking for guards for a brahmin drive up
    to Redding. Pay's $2000 minus any stock lost before you get there. If you're interested,
    be at the gate to Westin's place tomorrow. If you don't show, you don't go. Deal?
  114: Me come.
  115: No like. Me no do.
  116: Sounds good.
  117: Nah, I don't want to go to Redding.
  118: 'Well, then there''s no work for you here. Countryside''s a rough place. No
    place for weaklings, stranger. '
  119: Anything else?
  120: Good enough. Anything else, stranger?
  121: Buy.
  122: Work.
  123: Wes-tin?
  124: I'm looking for Roger Westin. Ever hear of him?
  125: Where can I find Frank Carlson?
  126: Carl-son?
  127: Goodbye.
  128: You mean Roger Weston? West of town.
  129: One of the stockholders in this place.  West of town. I don't think he's looking
    for ranch hands, if that's what you're thinking.
  130: He's the vice-president; I know that much. Otherwise, can't tell you anything,
    really. Spends all his time at the Presidential House. Hardly ever comes out,
    especially now what with all the trouble we've been having.
  131: Carlson. Big chief man. Lives in big house. That all.
  132: Sorry - cattle drive season's over. Come back in a few months.
  133: Yeah, yeah... Is there any other way to make a quick buck in town?
  134: There might be somthing like that. Let's just say the officials wouldn't want
    to know about an opportunity like this.
  135: Well, I would be willing to pay a little for some information.
  136: Hmm how much are you willing to part with?
  137: How about 500?
  138: How about 300?
  139: How about 200?
  140: How about 100?
  141: Well, you didn't hear this here, but the password to the door in the back is
    GANG PROBLEM LIMB.
  142: Hmm... Doesn't sound like somthing I would be interested in.
  143: Hmmm.. Don't forget about my 10 kids.
  144: Hmmm.. Well, the wife will want a new fur.
  145: Hmmm.. You're gonna have to contribute more.
  146: Ah, a little short on funds these days?
  147: I guess so.
  148: Come on now, don't be cheap.
  149: You're getting warmer.
  150: Look, I'm going to need a little more incentive.
  151: Hurry up, before someone sees.
  152: Are you sure your not involved with the law?
  153: Look, you're almost there, just keep it coming.
  154: Alright, just a little more, I promise.
  155: Be at the gate to Westin's place tomorrow. If you don't show, you don't go,
    understand?
scdusty:
  100: You see a dumpy-looking bald guy, polishing a glass.
  101: It's the bartender.
  102: He's a gruff-looking guy with a crooked nose and pinched up ears like he might
    have been a boxer years ago.
  103: What can I get you?
  104: Say, you're the one who got Jack to give up, ain't you? That was good work.
    So what do you want?
  105: Sure.
  106: Drink.
  107: Who's the big guy over there?
  108: What's to do in this town?
  109: Goodbye.
  110: That's Hoss, President Tandi's boy. Born trouble when he's drinking, so I'd
    stay clear of him if I were you.
  111: That was Hoss, President's Tandi's son. Boy, you sure whupped his ass good!
  112: President Tandi?
  113: Tough guy, eh? Thanks.
  114: Not much. If you're looking for trouble, go drink someplace else, like the
    Rawhide. If you're looking for work, there's the Westin place west of town. Heard
    some things about President Tandi looking for a specialist, too.
  115: Specialist?
  116: President Tandi?
  117: Thanks.
  118: Daughter of President Aradesh, the guy who founded NCR. She's been president
    for years. Does a good job too.
  119: And she's looking for a specialist? What kind?
  120: Who's the big guy?
  121: Thanks.
  122: Don't know. Gunther, her aide, probably does. He's down at the Hall of Congress.
  123: Who's the big guy?
  124: Thanks
  125: Would you like a drink?
  126: Sure.
  127: No.
  128: Let me buy you a drink! I've been wanting to smack him around for years!
  129: I've got some questions.
  130: Good! Bye.
scelise:
  100: You see a pretty young woman dressed in combat clothes.
  101: It's Elise.
  102: She's got a no-nonsense air about her, like she's used to giving orders and
    having folks obey them.
  103: What do you want?
  104: You again?
  105: Karl sent me.
  106: Doc Jubilee said I should talk to you.
  107: Who are you?
  108: Guh?
  109: I'm looking for an outfit. One that hates slavery. Calls itself the New California
    Rangers.
  110: Can you fix my car?
  111: Uh - I thought this place was deserted.
  112: Did he now? What did he tell you?
  113: Not much. That you were good folks and I might want to hook up with you.
  114: Said you'd paid good money.
  115: I'm Elise. That's Gond. We're members of a 'group' that's trying to do right
    for folks.
  116: You don't look like a charity or a church.
  117: Sounds interesting. Right in what way?
  118: I just want to get my car fixed.
  119: Just get yourself out of here. Saloon's back on main street.
  120: Hates slavery, huh. Interesting. What would you do if you found this outfit?
  121: I'd ask to join them.
  122: I'd kick their butts.
  123: Nothing.
  124: None of your business. Now get out.
  125: We've gotten out of the car business. Closed permanently. Goodbye.
  126: It's not. Goodbye.
  127: All right, so tell me. What's your opinion of slavers?
  128: Hate 'em. Disgusting, vile scum of the earth.
  129: If they leave me alone, I leave them alone.
  130: Some of my best friends are slavers.
  131: Money all you care about?
  132: Of course not. I believe in truth, justice and fighting for the oppressed,
  133: It's a start - until somebody names a better cause to fight for.
  134: What else is there?
  135: Don't bullshit me. I can see what kind of person you are. Goodbye.
  136: If you don't know, then I'm wasting my time. Goodbye.
  137: No, we are not a religious organization. Mind if I ask you a question?
  138: No, go ahead.
  139: Not so fast. You've got to pass a test to join the Rangers.
  140: Fine. Just tell me.
  141: Test? What is this - school?
  142: There's a slaver just outside town. Maybe you've seen his place. Free the slaves
    there and then come back and talk to us.
  143: I can do that.
  144: No way. I'm don't want to make any trouble here.
  145: Well, it's your lucky day.
  146: That's the kind of attitude that allows the atrocity of slavery to exist in
    the first place. I'm sorry, but there is no place for you in our organization.
  147: Ok.
  148: So, changed your mind? Ready to prove your worth?
  149: Sure.
  150: What was it you wanted done?
  151: Shouldn't you be doing something? Don't come back here until the job's done.
  152: I've heard the news already. You freed the slaves. Good work! So, you ready
    to become a Ranger?
  153: Yes.
  154: No.
  155: I hear you're the one who freed all the slaves outside the city gates. That
    was a fine thing you did and I just want to shake your hand.
  156: Thanks.
  157: Simple. We believe slavery is wrong and we'll do what we must to fight it.
    In NCR, we got a lot of friends in high places. Thanks to them we've already banned
    slavery down south, but now we're hoping to spread the word north.
  158: The Rangers sound like a group I'd be proud to join. Sign me up.
  159: Interesting... I'll have to think about what you've said.
  160: Do you swear to fight slavery whenever the opportunity arises and to help your
    fellow Rangers whenever they're in need?
  161: Yes.
  162: No,
  163: Congratulations, you're now a Ranger.
  164: Well-met, fellow Ranger. Afraid there's not much for you to do around here
    at this time. Most our people are already out on patrol. I'll spread the word
    that you're one of us now. I wouldn't want you getting shot by one of us.
  165: Well, we're always looking for good people to further our cause. If you change
    your mind, look me up. Are you sure you won't take the opportunity to join now?
  166: I'm sure.
  167: Well, now that you mention it, I think I would like to be a Ranger.
  168: I see. Well, I represent a group called the New California Rangers. Someone
    with views such as yours could qualify for membership. You interested?
  169: Great! Sign me up.
  170: Sounds interesting. What can you tell me about the Rangers?
  171: I see. Well thanks for stopping by but I can't see that we have anything more
    to say to each other. If you change your mind, come back and see me.
  172: Ok.
  173: That being the case, I have to ask you to get out of my sight. Now!
  174: Ok.
  175: A slaver! Get out of here before I remove that tattoo of yours with a bullet!
  176: Sure.
  177: Try it!
  178: We've got agents and sympathizers in some of the towns up north. We're spreading
    the word and hitting slavers wherever we can.
  179: Hello again. Have you changed your mind about joining us?
  180: Never mind.
  181: That doesn't belong to you. Now leave or I will get violent.
  182: I don't know what you did to Gond, but you're going to pay!
scenlone:
  100: You see a striking woman in a long robe.
  101: It's the Enlightened One.
  102: Her fixed stare and expression of mindless bliss would be disturbing were she
    not so tranquil.
  103: Greetings, child. Are you one of the Enlightened?
  104: "<Drool>"
  105: Sure, why not?
  106: Well, I am the Chosen One.
  107: Uh, I really don't know what you're talking about.
  108: So you're the itch Merk wants scratched!
  109: Yes.
  110: No.
  111: I just want to be alone.
  112: Hello? Anybody there?
  113: Guh.
  114: No-body here.
  115: Oh dear, a Level One. Still trapped in primitive state. Perhaps a zeta-scan
    alignment would help. Would you like that?
  116: Zay-ta!
  117: No!
  118: Please don't mock the Church of Hubology. It's oppressives like you who make
    things hard for the rest of us. Oh, dear. I'm all turbulent!
  119: Chosen One? Don't you mean AHS-One? Just what text are you working from?
  120: It's simple. I am the Chosen One because that is what must be.
  121: AHS one?
  122: That's what my Elder says I am.
  123: What are you talking about?
  124: Can we just get to the part where you sprinkle holy water on me or something?
  125: Oh. Well, are you seeking true understanding and spiritual peace? We can help.
  126: No, I'm looking for a GECK.
  127: Help? How?
  128: A rocket launcher gives me all the spiritual peace I need, lady.
  129: '"True understand" this! (rude hand gesture with the middle finger)'
  130: Merk? What's he want?
  131: Simple. He wants you dead. Say bye-bye.
  132: I don't know what you did, but he's put a contract out on you.
  133: Wonderful, brother. So what level are you?
  134: I asked you first.
  135: What level are you?
  136: Oh. I assumed you could see my aura. I'm sorry.
  137: Oh. I assumed you could see my aura. I'm sorry.
  138: " "
  139: Why, I'm at Transcendency, of course.
  140: Uhhh...isn't it really impolite to go talking about levels?
  141: Honestly! I don't know what they expect me to accomplish surrounded by such
    rim meat!
  142: Ah, such enthusiasm. Come with me.
  143: '"Lost are those who will not seek the Hub." If you should ever change your
    mind, you are always welcome.'
  144: Do not shout! Now I've got a neurodyne to align!
  145: Predestination? What about free will? By your belief, nothing you do has any
    meaning since it's all determined in advance. It's like you're just a pawn in
    a game.
  146: You misunderstand. Only my potential as the Chosen One is pre-determined. My
    choices and my actions determine the fulfillment of that potential.
  147: Of course the universe is deterministic! After all, we've been put here for
    some purpose that's already known to our creator.
  148: Nonsense. There is no organizing force determining our fates. In fact there's
    no 'higher power' behind anything. The universe is just chance. I am the Chosen
    One because others have declared it. That's all.
  149: Aligned Hub Seeker. You are obviously not Enlightened.
  150: A primitive belief - but you show signs of great promise.  We can show you
    the higher path. Would you like to know more?
  151: Yes.
  152: No.
  153: I can't help you with that. However, our scientists in San Francisco might
    know something. Perhaps you should travel there.
  154: By purging you of the negative psychic energy that keeps you in an oppressive
    state. Only then can you be Enlightened!
  155: Neurodynes are the psychic centers of the body. They become polluted by the
    spiritual remnants of the people who died in the War. Their psi-energies imprint
    into our neurodynes at birth and hold us in an oppressive state. Alignment erases
    these imprints.
  156: As long as your brain chemistry is affected by negative psychic energy, your
    true spiritual potential is oppressed. Worse still, oppressives can transmit this
    energy unless they are very, very strong-willed.
  157: Enlightenment happens when all your neurodynes are aligned. Then you become
    an AHS, Aligned Hub Seeker, which is the goal of all Hubonites.
  158: Neurodynes?
  159: Enlightened?
  160: Oppressive state?
  161: So how's this purging work? Is it painful?
  162: It's not painful. You just undergo a zeta-scan. I can do one now, if you like.
  163: Sure.
  164: No way!
  165: The Church of Hubology exists to free mankind from the chains that have kept
    his full spiritual potential in shackles.
  166: How do you do that?
  167: Oh yeah, like "Let my psyche go," right?
  168: That is not an ability that I possess. Is there something else that I can help
    you with? An alignment perhaps?
  169: I'll take the alignment.
  170: I need some information. Vault 13 - what do you know about it?
  171: How have things been going?
  172: Forget about it. No hard feelings. That's all.
  173: " "
  174: Yes!
  175: " "
  176: Transcendency?  Honestly, how do they expect me to spread the word out here
    when they don't even keep me up-to-date on the latest doctrine!?
  177: "(Continue)"
  178: Were you asleep during indoctrination? Hmmph - you are not one of the Enlightened!
  179: So you're saying there's some higher power who creates us with a purpose and
    then just abandons us? I can't believe any being would be so callous. Come, embrace
    the Church of Hubology. Let us show you the true way.
  180: What true way?
  181: No thanks.
  182: Without control of your own life, though, what's the point? Nothing you do
    has any value. Did you choose to get up this morning? No, you're just a puppet
    by your own philosophy. Now, we at the church of Hubology have a true answer.
  183: Which is?
  184: Sure you do.
  185: Oh, what a sad and empty philosophy that is! Even if it were true, the only
    course for you is to seek to develop yourself. It is the only thing you have any
    control over. The Church of Hubology can help.
  186: How?
  187: Oh, get out of my face.
  188: Vault 13? Our scientists have been searching for it somewhere to the west.
    That is all I know. Are you sure you don't want an alignment?
  189: Sure, why not.
  190: No thanks. I'm fine.
  191: I tell you, spreading the word of Hubology out here is harder than you can
    imagine! AHS-9 just doesn't understand the difficulty. In fact, I've written it
    all down. Say, would you be willing to deliver it to AHS-9 in San Francisco? I
    can't promise any reward, but I know AHS-9 will appreciate it.
  192: Sure, why not?
  193: No thanks. I don't get involved.
  194: Excellent. Here is the letter. Now, can I do anything else for you? A zeta-scan?
  195: A scan? Why not.
  196: You've already done enough. Bye.
  197: Then I've spoken too much already. Goodbye
  198: Greetings again. How can the Church of Hubology help you?
  199: "<Drool>"
  200: So you're the itch Merk wants scratched!
  201: Uh, I really don't know what you're talking about.
  202: What does the church do?
  203: Oops. Wrong door.
  204: Killing me will serve no purpose. I'm not a threat to Merk, I simply irritate
    him because of my beliefs. I hope you'll refuse to honor the contract.
  205: Yeah, you seem harmless.
  206: Forget it. You're one dead Hubologist.
  207: I don't have time for idiots. Please go away.
  208: Out, apostate!
  209: There is nothing you can say to gain favor in the Church of Hubology, blasphemer.
  210: Close your eyes. This won't hurt a bit.
  211: There. We erased a few nasty imprints! You are now an AHS-1. Now, if you'll
    excuse me, I have to tend my church.
  212: Greetings, fellow seeker. There is nothing more I can do for you. You must
    continue your journey as an AHS-1 on your own.
  213: The church is closed. Come back tomorrow.
  214: I would love to help you, but even an AHS-4 must sleep. Come back in daylight.
  215: Intruder! Do you plan to desecrate this place? Out!
  216: Wonderful, sister. So what level are you?
  217: " "
  218: 'You gain '
  219: experience for taking care of the Hubologist for Merk.
scfelix:
  100: You see a man wearing leathers and packing heat.
  101: It's Felix, the ranch foreman.
  102: He looks like a cooler, tougher customer than the rest of the lot hanging around
    here.
  103: What can I do for you, stranger?
  104: You again?
  105: Nyeh.
  106: The sheriff told me to come by - said Mr. Westin might have a job for me.
  107: I'm here to see the boss.
  108: I'm looking for work.
  109: I'm looking for Vault 13.
  110: Just looking around.
  111: Great, another idiot. I suppose you want to see the boss?
  112: Uh-huh.
  113: Nooo.
  114: Fine. Go on in.
  115: It's late. Come back in the morning.
  116: Well then, get on out of here.
  117: Dumont, eh? Well, that's good enough for me. Mr. Westin's inside.
  118: That's nice. Mr. Westin don't just see anybody. You got any cause?
  119: I'm looking for Vault 13.
  120: What if I said Bishop in New Reno sent me to kill him?
  121: Uh, no.
  122: Hah! Another crackpot. You ought to go talk to Saltbeef. You and he'd get along
    fine.
  123: Who?
  124: I'm out of here.
  125: Saltbeef Bob - over in the stables. Mr. Westin lets him stay there. Now stop
    wasting my time.
  126: Oh, thanks.
  127: Then I guess we got to kill you.
  128: Done with your meeting?
  129: Westin. Job. Me
  130: Me go.
  131: Fine, he wants you to have a job; I got a job for you. Someone, or something,
    kill moo-moos. You come me. You guard. Keep moo-moos safe. Make boss happy. Okay?
  132: Okay.
  133: No. Me no kill.
  134: Back again, are you? Job done?
  135: Yes.
  136: No.
  137: Yeah, he left orders. He's been expecting you.
  138: HEY YOU! Get away from there!
  139: Okay.
  140: Fuck you!
  141: Yeah. He said to see you about some problem with the brahmin.
  142: Yes. I'm out of here.
  143: Right. Someone, or something, has been killing brahmin on the west pasture.
    I'll take you out there and you take care of it. Let's go.
  144: Forget that!
  145: Mr. Westin is waiting for you.
  146: Well, we were having a problem with varmints, but they stopped hassling us.
    You can see Westin if you want.
  147: I'm here on business from Vault City.
  500: You touch that door again and there'll be hell to pay. Got that, buddy?
scfergus:
  100: You see a plain-looking young man in respectable clothing.
  101: It's the building receptionist.
  102: There's nothing partiuclarly exceptional about the guy. He looks like the epitome
    of a budding bureaucrat.
  103: Welcome to Congress House. How can I help you?
  104: Back again, I see. How can I help you this time?
  105: Now, what can I do for you?
  106: Uhhh...
  107: Me see Tandi?
  108: Me see Tandi?
  109: I'm here to see President Tandi.
  110: Can you help me find Vault 13?
  111: Not unless you've got a GECK.
  112: I've got some important news for your boss.
  113: I'm here to see President Tandi.
  114: I'm here to see President Tandi.
  115: I'm looking for a job.
  116: What is this place?
  117: You can't.

  120: Concerning?
  121: Hmmm... Why do you want see Madam President?
  122: Man say Tandi hire me.

  131: This is the Congress House, law-making body for NCR.

  138: Oh, that. Talk to Mr. Gunther, in back.
  139: Vault 15? They want to make a deal? Interesting. In the back - talk to Gunther.
  140: You can tell her yourself. Just go and talk to Gunther.
  141: That doesn't sound good. Now excuse me, I have work to do.
  142: I have to tell her something.
  143: Fine. Tell her there's a spy in her office.
  144: You just tell her I want to see her. Understand?
  145: Well then, I can't help you with that.

    that.

  150: Tell her I solved her squatter problem.

  152: You did? Well...I'm sure that's wonderful news. Did you learn anything else?
  153: 'No'
  154: Yeah, there's something else -- something about a spy.

  100: You see a woman in the armored uniform of the NCR.
  101: It's the captain of the guard.
  102: She may be a woman, but that shotgun on her hip says she ain't no pushover.
  103: You'll have to excuse me, I'm a busy woman. No time for chitchat.
  104: Just keep your nose clean and we'll get along just fine, stranger.
  105: You got questions? Look up Sheriff Dumont. He'll fill you in.
  106: Laws are on the bulletin board outside - no weapons, no drunks, no trouble.
  107: What can I do for you, stranger?
  108: You again?
  109: Me go in.
  110: I'd like to get into NCR.
  111: Nothing.
  112: You aren't going anywhere until you stow those weapons.
  113: Everybody's got to put their weapons away.

    it in the log book.

  103: Hey, did Elise say you could be here?
  104: Are you a Ranger, too?
  105: You ain't supposed to be here.
  106: Greetings (brother/sister).
  107: A Ranger's work is never done.
  108: Take heart! Our brother's hit a slave camp last week.

  102: Let's see - tough guy, has a gun, has a badge, has armor - hmm, might be a
    guard.
  103: Welcome the NCR. Just to let you know, if you got weapons, keep 'em holstered.
    This ain't a gun-toting town, stranger.
  104: Welcome to NCR, capital of the New California Republic, President Tandi ruling.
  105: Greetings, stranger. Come to do business with NCR, have you?
  106: NCR welcomes you - provided you don't make trouble.
  107: Hey you, put your weapons away. NCR don't welcome that kind of trouble.
  108: Stranger, NCR's got laws and one of them's "No weapons."  Put it away and there'll
    be no trouble.
  109: Read the sign on the way in? "No weapons," and we mean it. Understand?
  110: You drifters are all alike. This is a peaceful town - that means we don't need
    you toting hardware. Put your weapons away and there'll be no trouble.
  111: Gate's closed for the night. If you got pressing business, take it to the guardhouse.
  112: You gotta talk to the guard captain if you want through the gate.
  113: Kinda late for coming to town. Go see the captain; maybe she'll let you in.
  114: I'd turn and walk away real fast if I were you.
  115: You and your kind ain't welcome in NCR.
  116: Come any closer and you'll regret it.
  117: We've been warned about you, so just leave peacefully. Understand?
scgunthr:
  100: You see a slender young man wearing glasses.
  101: It's Gunther, aide to President Tandi. At least that's what the sign on the
    door said.
  102: He looks officious and busy, the type born to be a bureaucrat that other folks
    hate.
  103: Can I help you?
  104: You again?
  105: Uhhhh - work. Work Tandi.
  106: Who are you?
  107: I'm here to see President Tandi about a job.
  108: Sorry, wrong office.
  109: You want job?
  110: Let's try this again. You help Tandi? Do job for Tandi?
  111: Yesyesyesyes!
  112: Tandi job. Me want.
  113: What you do?
  114: Uhhhh...me kill, me kill big!
  115: Uhhhh...me smart. Elder say I got brain-of-child. I got 2 brain. Me smart.
  116: You can't take the president's job!
  117: No?
  118: Oh. Okay.
  119: |-
    Right. I'm not sure that's what she's looking for. Oh well, she said send them all in.

    You go. Talk Tandi now.
  120: NO! You are dumb. President must be smart, talk in two-syllable words! You
    no president.
  121: Oh. What me do?
  122: Me no like you. You yell. Bad man.
  123: My name is Gunther, personal assistant to President Tandi. Now, what can I
    do for you?
  124: I'm searching for Vault 13.
  125: I'm looking for the GECK.
  126: I understand the president has a job to be done.
  127: Madam President no longer grants interviews regarding Vault 13. I'm sorry.
    She's too busy to see every prospector who comes through.
  128: Huh? I don't get it.
  129: What about a GECK. She might know something about that?
  130: There was some talk about a job.
  131: You're useless. I'm going.
  132: Then I suggest you read the plaque on the statue outside. Now, good day.
  133: I have no idea what you are talking about. Do you have real question?
  134: I'm searching for Vault 13.
  135: I understand the president has a job to be done.
  136: Never mind.
  137: Ah yes. Well, she's instructed me to send in anyone asking about it. You're
    buzzed in. It's the door to my right.
  138: Madam President is finished with you? How did things go?
  139: Good. Me bye-bye.
  140: Just fine. Now, I'm out of here.
  141: Here to report the outcome of Vault 15?
  142: Yes.
  143: No.
  144: Well, I'm sorry, but Madam President is very busy. Why don't you come back
    when the job is done?
  145: Okay.
  146: Excellent! I'll buzz you right in.
  147: You bastard! Guards! Assassin! Murderer!
  148: Back so soon! Now what?
  149: Re-ward.
  150: The president said to see you about a reward.
  151: Mon-ey.
  152: I'm here to collect my pay.
  153: Your president said you should know there's a spy in your house - somebody
    named Feargus.
  154: Nothing.
  155: Of course, she just buzzed me about it. A reward of $6000 and NCR thanks you,
    she said. Now, there is work to be done. Goodbye.
  156: Let's see. Contract says $500. Here you are.
  157: In fact, she just buzzed me to change your amount - seems you earned a bonus.
    Here it is, $900 and NCR's thanks. Now, there is work to be done, so goodbye.
  158: Your president said you should know there's a spy in your house - somebody
    named Feargus.
  159: Goodbye.
  160: Feargus? I don't believe it!
  161: Take a look at this disk.
  162: Whatever. I'm out of here.
  163: Damn. Looks solid. Look, we'll take care of this. Here's $4000 for the info.
  164: I don't take blood money. I'm out of here.
  165: Thanks. Have a nice day.
  166: Oh, it's you. Look, this is not a good time. In fact, I think Madam President
    would rather not get you involved in anything else. Thank you and good day.
  167: Let me make myself clear. The President is not going to see you - now or ever.
    You've been paid. Now just leave.
  171: Me go.
  172: Absolutely nothing.
  173: You bitch! Guards! Assassin. Murderer!
  174: I've been to Vault 15 and I need to talk to your boss about it.
  175: Me need talk about Vault 15.
  176: You should know there's a spy in your house - somebody named F.
  500: We keep the doors locked for a reason.
  501: I must ask you to leave.
  502: This is your last warning. Leave before I have you removed.
  503: Security - please deal with this pest.
schal:
  100: He's a  muscular guy, with a barrel chest.
  101: It's Hal, the captain for the brahmin drive.
  102: He's chewing a wad of something you hope he don't spit this way, because it
    stinks to high heaven.
  103: You here for the drive?
  104: "[]"
  105: Yes.
  106: No.
  107: Need some redding floats!!!
  108: Yuep need those redding floats!!
  109: Wonder what Redding floats go here.
  110: Great. Let's roll out. Head 'em out for Redding boys!
  111: Well then, leave me alone. I got 500 head of brahmin to get on the trail.
  112: You again? Go away.
  113: Well, that was the crapper! Afraid there's no money in this run for any of
    us. Just be happy you're alive.
  114: Well, the ranchers are none too happy - it's only a $1000 run. Tough luck.
  115: Well we had little string of bad luck but did all right. Here's the $2000 you
    signed on for.
  116: Hot damn, you were just fine! There's a $1000 bonus in it for you. That and
    $2000 makes your pay. Redding better watch out tonight!
  117: You're on your own. Good travelling with you.
schenry:
  100: You see a pudgy guy with a shiny bald head and thick-lensed glasses.
  101: It's Dr. Henry
  102: This guy is so out of place it's painful. He's got that egghead, not living
    in the real world air about him, that's for sure.
  103: Excuse me, I'm Dr. Henry and I'm very busy. What do you want?
  104: You again? What do you want?
  105: Hurgh.
  106: I'm
  107: Enough chit-chat. You've got some papers Mr. Merk wants. Hand em over and nobody
    gets hurt.
  108: Ever heard of a place called the Enclave?
  109: None of your business.
  110: Hmm, sub-par cranial development... Stunted intellectual development. No gross
    physical mutation, though. No, you just simply won't do, I'm afraid. Good day.
  111: The Chosen One? Of course, that makes sense.  Interesting... I'm afraid I can't
    help you. I was assigned to cyber-genetics research, not the Vault Behavioral
    Project.
  112: What are you talking about?
  113: Vault Behavioral project?
  114: Cyber-genetics? I don't remember ever studying that one.
  115: Right. You're mad as a hatter. Goodbye.
  116: Oh my, I've said more than I should already. Never mind, and if anybody asks
    I didn't say anything.
  117: Something about extreme sociological conditioning. Mind you, I thought it was
    all so much mumbo-jumbo, no real science in it at all. But I did hear something
    about 13 having to be improvised during the course of the experiment.  Sloppy
    work, I'd say.
  118: Experiment? What experiment?
  119: What's this about cyber-genetics?
  120: You expect me to believe any of this? You are a loon.
  121: Oh, it's a whole new field - very exciting. Why I'm working on some projects
    right now - a radical new concept for the mutant problem.  You see, it's really
    quite simple - mutancy isn't absolute. It can be cured.
  122: Of course, my simple-minded colleagues were just trying to solve the whole
    problem the crudest way possible. Purification, indeed. I'll admit there were
    some early problems, but I've got them worked out now...I think.
  123: "[]"
  124: Continue
  125: In fact, you could help me perform the field testing. Interested?
  126: Field testing? What do you mean?
  127: Not a chance.
  128: I've prepared a small sample of the serum but it needs to be injected into
    a host.
  129: I'm not letting you stick any needles in me!
  130: That's it, I'm out of here.
  131: You? Oh, no - the serum's not refined enough to handle such a low mutagenic
    quotient. It must be used on a super-mutant. Inject the serum into a super-mutant
    and then come back and report the results. I understand Broken Hills is full of
    them.
  132: What's it do?
  133: What's in it for me?
  134: Well, it should cause a regression in the genetic matrix that results in the
    destabilization and assimilation of abberant DNA, leaving the host free of mutagenic
    potential. If I knew for sure, I wouldn't need you to test it.
  135: What's in it for me?
  136: You'll be participating in an important experiment, in fact, the most important,
    scientific-oh, you mean money. Well, I do have a Cyber-Hound Mk. II, Personal
    Security Model, that I brought with me. I suppose I could have it activated and
    on-line by the time you got back. Would that do?
  137: Cyber-hound? Sure, why not.
  138: You are out of your mind. Just completely loony.
  139: Excellent. Here's the serum, fitted up in an stim hypo. All you have to do
    is use it on a super-mutant and then report back to me. Like I said, Broken Hills
    - that's the place to look. Good luck.
  140: Tell your Mr. Merk that my answer hasn't changed. I have no interest in any
    of his "joint ventures." Thank you and good day.
  141: It's no use, I'm not going back. None of you appreciated the work I was doing,
    so don't pretend to be my friend. Thank you very much!
  142: Well then, we've nothing to talk about. Good day.
  143: So, how did it go? Is the test done?
  144: Yes.
  145: No.
  146: Well, if you don't mind, would you please get on with it? I'm not a young man
    anymore.
  147: And... How did it work?
  148: It killed him! You said it would cure mutants!
  149: He's dead, Jim.
  150: You misunderstood. I said it would remove their mutagenic potential. The process
    does seem violent on the system, though.  Oh well, more refining to do.
  151: What about my pay?
  152: You're a monster! I want nothing to do with you.
  153: Still some bugs, I see. Well, try and try again.
  154: What about my pay?
  155: You're a monster! I want nothing to do with you.
  156: Of course. The cyberdog is all yours. Now, I have work to do.
  157: "...so the mutation rate stablizes over-don't bother me now."
  158: Primitive adaptation to environmental conditions. Fascinating.
  159: You don't have an oscillating calibrator? No, of course not.
  160: ", the Chosen One. I'm looking for Vault 13."
  161: Good day, my ass, bucko, I'm here to be polite. You hand over those papers
    or I'll start removing fingers. Let's see how good of a doc you are then.
  162: Fine, I'll let him know.
  163: Uh... Ok, the papers are in my desk over there. Take them; just don't hurt
    my hands. Ok?
  164: Kiss my ass, you cretin! Guards! Guards!
  165: Now you're being reasonable. I'll let Mr. Merk know.
  166: You'll regret that, Doc.
  167: Hey! You have exactly ten seconds to put those papers back before I call the
    guards.
  168: Caught you again, huh? Fine, I'll let the law deal with you. Guards! Guards!
schoss:
  100: You see a big, dumb-looking and over-muscled lunk.
  101: It's Hoss
  102: He doesn't appear to be armed, with weapons or wit.
  103: Hey you, turd-face. I don't like you. I think you should buy me a drink.
  104: Hey baby, come on over here and I'll give you a nice big wet one.
  105: "<Fart!>"
  106: Bite me.
  107: I don't want any trouble.
  108: So you think you're tough? I'm gonna wipe your ass all over the floor. Bare
    fists, right here, right now.
  109: '"I don''t want any trouble!" Well, you''re gonna have it. You either fight
    me or I''m gonna tell everybody what a spineless little baby you are. Bare fists,
    right here.'
  110: Fine, let's dance.
  111: No really, I couldn't.
  112: Haw! What a joke. Get outta here, jellyfish.
  113: Ow! You broke my nose! I quit! Don't hit me anymore!
  114: Okay, I'm sorry. I was only joking. You won't have any more trouble from me...please,
    don't kill me!
  115: Hey, I'm backing off. Okay, don't hit me?
sckarl:
  100: You see a young man wearing the badge of the NCR police
  101: It's Karl, the town deputy.
  102: You see a young man barely out of his teens. He looks eager to please.
  103: Welcome, stranger. I'm Deputy Karl. What can I do for you?
  104: Such as?
  105: Uh...nugh..
  106: I'm new to NCR. What can you tell me about your town?
  107: Well, I'm looking for Vault 13.
  108: President Tandi sent me over to talk to some prisoner you've got.
  109: My name's
  110: I'm looking for a guy named Jack. Some folks call him Whack Jack.
  111: Where can I find Roger Westin?
  112: Okay, had a little too much party did you? Look, there's an unlocked cell back
    there. Why don't you go in back and sleep it off?
  113: Look, take my advice - get your friends to take you home so you can sleep it
    off. Drunk in public's a crime here.
  114: This is NCR, capitol of the New California Republic. Population 3000 and growing.
    No slavery, no gambling, no chems. President is Mrs. Tandi, my boss is Sheriff
    Dumont. That answer your questions?
  115: Well, I've got some other questions.
  116: Yeah, that's all.
  117: So did I when I was a kid. Let me know if you find it!
  118: Well, I've got some other questions.
  119: Gee, thanks.
  120: His name's Oswald. That's all we could get out of him. He's supposed to be
    a squatter, from vault 15, but... I doubt it. He's a bit too tough. You know what
    I mean?
  121: Tough guy, huh?
  122: What're you going to do to him?
  123: Say, I've heard of you haven't I? Yeah - some pretty good stuff. Look, there's
    some folks I know, they could use a fellow like you. Just go to the auto shop
    and ask for Elise. Tell her Karl sends his regards.
  124: Work? The Stockmen's Association is looking for guards. Raiders been hitting
    the cattle drives hard again. And I heard that President Tandi's been looking
    for somebody "resourceful," as she puts it. That help?
  125: Well, I've got some other questions.
  126: Some. Thanks.
  127: That's Officer Jack, stranger. One of our men. You haven't been talking to
    Mira, have you?
  128: Yes.
  129: Mira who?
  130: That SOB? He's got a spread just outside town. Just take the road past Stockmen's.
  131: You don't like him much.
  132: Well, I've got some other questions.
  133: Thanks.
  134: Yeah. He's a real bad one. Killed two of our men and hasn't said a thing.
  135: Give me a little time alone with him. Maybe I can convince him to be cooperative.
  136: Can I see him now?
  137: Hang the bastard, I hope. Him and his buddies killed two good men. Won't be
    any pain for me to see him dead.
  138: Can I see him now?
  139: |-
    She and Jack used to be married, you know. Had themselves a really messy divorce. I wouldn't believe spit from her, not about Jack.
    Do yourself a favor, stay out of it. Jack's a good man, it's just this stuff's got him a little high-strung.
  140: Okay, let's move on to other topics.
  141: Well, thank you kindly for that advice, deputy.
  142: His ex, that's all. If he's not here, he might be over at the powerplant. He's
    been moonlighting over there for Dorothy.
  143: Well, I've got some other questions.
  144: Thanks.
  145: Guess I'm pretty obvious. Lot of folks look up to him because he's a councilman,
    but not me. He thinks he's a big man, like the law don't always apply to him.
    I'd like to take him down a notch or two someday.
  146: Stranger things have happened. What can you tell me about him?
  147: I've got to go. Just outside of town, you say?
  148: No problem. Next five minutes, maybe I won't hear a thing. Follow me.
  149: Sure, for what good it will do you.
  150: Well, a couple of years ago he had a stroke and now Doc Jubilee's got him on
    some kind of medicine. What's it to you, anyway?
  151: Nothing, just talk. I'll quit wasting your time.
  152: ". I'm in need of some honest work."
sclenny:
  100: A mutant - and a tame one at that.
  101: That's Lenny, remember? The obnoxious one.
  102: Hoo-boy - this lad's a piece of work. Besides the fact he's green and ugly,
    he's got more scars on him than an old whore. This one's a fighter, for sure.
  103: I'm Lenny and you're pond scum. Get outta here.
  104: Why you bothering Lenny, you little white grub?
  105: What you want with Lenny, worthless human?
  106: Keep poking me and you can tell your maker Lenny sent you.
  107: Pleased to meet ya. I'm Lenny - you must be Shit-for-brains. Ha, ha!
  108: Tell yer mutant master my name's Lenny, slave.
  109: Hey, brother mutie, Lenny wonder why you hanging with this human slug?
  110: Lenny don't talk to nobody. Makes muties his slaves, grub.
  111: Lenny says you and your butt-kissing mutie Tom can go to hell.
  112: Watch out. Lenny ain't no tame mutie like the one you got now.
  113: Hey, the little pale skin's back!
  114: Get off my case, human.
  115: Get lost, chump.
  116: What's the matter? Need somebody to change yer diaper?
  117: You are as dense as a pile of bricks, human.
scmerk:
  100: You see a well-dressed, heavy set man who moves with deliberate slowness.
  101: It's Merk - folks call him The Man around here.
  102: This fellow's got an air of arrogant coldness to him, like he cares for you
    no more than the fly he just squished between his fingers.
  103: Hey, I've seen you in the movies! Come to show me some action, have you?
  104: Whaddya mean, disturbing my peace like this? Get outta here.
  105: Excuse me, I got business to conduct.
  106: You wanna talk business, see me at the Rawhide . Otherwise leave me alone.
  107: I've seen you on the silver screen, ain't I? You got impressive, uh, credentials.
  108: You got that certain look in your eyes. Stop by the Rawhide - I could always
    use somebody like you.
  109: Shit, what's that smell? Something just walked into the room.
  110: Go fetch me another whiskey - quick now.
  111: Got no time right now.
  112: I'm a guest here. Stop bothering me.
  113: Hey baby, nice tracts you got. Carlson's taste's improving.
  114: I don't do business here.
  115: I don't know you. I'm a respectable businessman.
  116: Well, if it ain't the wuss. Go on and leave me alone.
  117: So, decided to look me up after all, eh baby?
  118: I don't know nothing about nothing, understand.
  119: The veep's not gonna like you bothering his guests.
  120: Damn fine booze the man serves here.
  121: Get outta my way!
  122: You wanna talk to somebody, go buy yourself a friend.
  123: I don't give directions and I don't pass out change. Bug off.
  124: What is this - social hour?
  125: I'm Merk. Whattya want?
  126: You again?
  127: Well keep it polite, punk, or this could get ugly.
  128: Oort.
  129: I'm looking for work.
  130: Informed sources say you're the man to see about doing business, if you know
    what I mean.
  131: They say you're the man who ripped off my car.
  132: I'm looking for some information.
  133: Some say you might know a thing or two about, oh say, stuff missing from cars.
  134: You again? So's the job done?
  135: Glub.
  136: No.
  137: I got some questions
  138: Hmm... Strong. Dumb...If you want a job, talk to Mira. Understand? Mi-ra. Over
    there.
  139: Like making noises? Will somebody get this brahmin turd out of here?
  140: Are you that stupid? You think I'm just gonna hire anybody? You work for me,
    you got to prove you're good for something.
  141: How about I just shoot Lenny, there? He deserves it.
  142: Prove like how?
  143: You know anybody who'd like some jet, maybe?
  144: Listen, I'm
  145: Right. Like I got to prove myself to you. Forget you, slugwort.
  146: It was that goddamn Doofus, wasn't it? That little junkie talks to much for
    his own good. Tell you what - you cap him for me -- call it a favor -- and then
    we'll talk.
  147: Deal.
  148: Whoa - I'm not that cold-blooded!
  149: And they're gonna say you were a dumb ass. Boys-
  150: Interesting. Now who'd go saying something like that?
  151: Don't bullshit me, fat man. If I don't get back what's mine, somebody'll be
    shopping for your burial suit.
  152: Cute. You gonna answer my question or not?
  153: Oh, it's just something I heard. Just wanted to see what you'd say.
  154: Supposing I do know something. What of it?
  155: Now if a man had some things missing, do you suppose he could buy those things
    back?
  156: I want my shit back, fat man!
  157: How about I talk to the law?
  158: I'm tired of this. Boys - take care of our guest.
  159: I don't think Lenny would like that.
  160: Probably, but I wasn't asking him.
  161: Have it your way.
  162: True. Been too dull around here. Time for a little one-on-one in the basement.
    Come on, Lenny, I want to watch you kill this
  163: Like I've got problems that need solving.
  164: Such as?
  165: Jet? Are you proposing something...?
  166: My friend here knows how to make it. Interested?
  167: Something illegal? No, I wouldn't do that.
  168: Intriguing. I'll give you $1000 for his services - permanently.
  169: Deal.
  170: No, I can't do that to a friend.
  171: 'Looks like we can do business, friend. Here''s the deal - there''s a loopy
    scientist in town - Dr. Henry. He''s got some papers I''d like. I''ll pay $1000
    for them. Oh, and I don''t want no harm to come to Dr Henry. He''s useful alive.
    Interested? '
  172: I'm on it.
  173: Nope, not my style.
  174: Knowledge costs you. Am I clear?
  175: '"The price of wisdom is above rubies."'
  176: Here's $50.
  177: Forget it.
  178: Oh, you're that person.
  179: Continue
  180: Well, as far as I'm concerned, here you're just a pile of dung.
  181: I had you figured for a wuss.
  182: Okay. No problem. I don't want no trouble. I'll tell you what, I'll even have
    my boys put the stuff right back where they found it.
  183: It better be, or I'll be back.
  184: Don't give me this bs!
  185: Such a person just might be able to.
  186: Now, I suggest you leave.
  187: By all means, call in the officers. Of course, I assume you have evidence to
    back up your wild accusation.
  188: Yeah, sure.
  189: Never mind.
  190: Such as there's a damn Hubologist in town who has irritated me. Once this itch
    is scratched, come back and talk to me.
  191: Consider it done. I got just the backscratcher for him but... what's an Hubologist
    and where do I find him?
  192: How dare you speak against the true belief!
  193: Sorry, I don't get involved in religious wars.
  194: Well, I am a learned man. What's your question?
  195: Ask away.
  196: I'm looking for Vault 13.
  197: Ever hear of a GECK?
  198: What do you know about some outfit called the Rangers?
  199: What can you tell me about some guy named Westin?
  200: I'm looking for info on Vice-President Carlson.
  201: That's it.
  202: Your payment gets you one question. Another costs you another $50.
  203: Okay, here.
  204: I've got all the facts I need.
  205: Just so happens, I've got a map to Vault 13. It's only 1000 bucks. You interested?
  206: Sure. I'll take it.
  207: And I'll bet you've got a bridge to sell, too.
  208: Maybe later.
  209: Is it some kind of chem out of New Reno? I've never heard of it.
  210: Nope. I've got some more questions, though.
  211: That's all I needed to know.
  212: Those bastards? Best stay out of my place or I'll put a hole in them.
  213: Well, that was informative. Another question.
  214: That's all I needed to know.
  215: The rancher, eh? Came in here one time, about croaked. Town doc had to rush
    over with some pills - seems Westin's got a heart condition. Ruined business for
    the rest of the night.
  216: Thanks for the info. I've got some more questions.
  217: That's all I needed to know.
  218: As a good citizen, I applaud Carlson's opposition to any New Reno influence
    around here. Now that Westin's dead, I've been helping out with security for the
    Vice President.
  219: Oh, well, I guess I'll never get to meet the man. I've heard a lot about him,
    too.
  220: That's all I needed to know.
  221: That all?
  222: No, I've got some more questions
  223: Yeah, that's it for now.
  224: Hey, a man's got to try. Vault 13's practically a religion around here. They've
    even built a statue to some chump who supposedly came from there. That's all I
    know.
  225: I sold you a map for it. Try using it.
  226: That map didn't pan out? Sorry. The guy swore it was genuine. How was I to
    know? I don't know where Vault 13 is.
  227: I've got some more questions.
  228: That's all I need to know.
  229: Tell you what. I like your work and Carlson could use another guard. Give a
    little time and there'll be a job waiting for you down there.
  230: I'm on it, Merk.
  231: I don't need a job. Thanks anyway.
  232: Excellent. Come back when you're done.
  233: |-
    That is very troubling.

    Boys, kill him and recover this evidvence.
  234: Your feeble attempts to intimidate me are almost amusing, but now I suggest
    you leave before I tire of this game.
  235: Ah, I've heard the news. You still interested in a job?
  236: Yeah, I'm tired of freebies. I could use the work.
  237: No.
  238: What the hell you doing in my place?
  239: I was out of line before. I won't do it again. I just want a little of your
    time.
  240: I'll do what I want, you weasel.
  241: Get out of here, you warthog!
  242: Then what're you doing here you dumb shit? You wanna impress me, then get things
    done!
  243: I'm not talking to you until the job's done!
  244: That disappoints me. I normally remove things that disappoint me. However,
    in your case I can be generous. Just leave and don't come back and I'll forget
    all about it.
  245: So, is that little business with Dr. Henry done?
  246: Yeah, I got the papers you want.
  247: No.
  248: Days like this make me so happy. Well, let's conclude our business.
  249: It has come to my attention that the ingenious doctor expired during your visit.
    That was against my orders. To recoup future losses I think it will be necessary
    to receive a refund.
  250: Look, I'll just give you 500 bucks and we'll forget the whole deal.
  251: Screw you.
  252: Well, success in your ventures. I see no reason for us to talk again.
  253: Fine by me.
  254: Deal - but only because I like you. I suggest you don't come back any time
    soon.
  255: I think I'll just kill you, get my money back, and collect a reward. After
    all, that's what being a good citizen is all about.
  256: You again! DIE!
  257: I thought I said don't bother me anymore.
  258: " and I'm a badass mofo. Just ask anybody."
  259: " guy."
  260: " chick."
  261: A Hubologist is a nut-case religious fanatic. It can be found at the church
    in town.
  262: I'm on my way.
  263: I'm not talking to you until the job's done! I need those papers from Dr. Henry's
    place, pronto.
  264: No, but I need some information.
  265: I know Lenny's death ain't no accident, you bastard.
  266: Hey that map was a fake.
  267: Well what about the money I gave you.
  268: Like I said sorry it didn't pan out for you.
  269: Well how bout you eat this bullet for my trouble.
  270: Hmmphf.
  271: 'You gain '
  272: exp for Retriving Dr. Henry's papers.
scmikey:
  100: You see a sharp-dressed guy hawking lizard kebabs.
  101: It's the lizard-on-a-stick vendor.
  102: For a lizard-on-a-stick vendor, this guy's got style. He's clean, well-dressed
    and runs a pretty spotless little operation.
  103: Hungry, stranger? I got the best lizard around. Ask anybody!
  104: What can I get you?
  105: Gimme meat.
  106: I'll take one.
  107: What can you tell me about this town?
  108: Goodbye.
  109: Enjoy, stranger!
  110: There's mustard and onions over there.
  111: Hey, buddy.
  112: Yeah, bye.
  113: Next!
  114: Look, I got a rule. I don't say nothing about nobody. It's a good rule, because
    if I keep my mouth shut, I keep out of trouble. Capice?
  115: I don't hear nothing, I don't see nothing, and I especially don't say nothing.
    Now, stop bothering me about that.
  116: Fine. Look, I'm hungry.
  117: Do you have a GECK?
  118: Sorry for troubling, Christ!
  119: A GECK? Well, that's old history, so what the hell. You mean the old Garden
    of Eden Kit. We had one - I mean our grandparents had one. Used it when they came
    out of Vault 15. Got this place started, they say. It's all used up now.
  120: I'm still hungry.
  121: Well, thanks for not much.
scmira:
  100: You'd guess that even with the green hair and the scowl, she's the bartender
    of this joint.
  101: That's Mira. She mixes a mean Rad-A-Waster
  102: Well, she's young and attractive, but there's just a look in her eye that says
    she don't take no crap from anybody. That and the spiked knuckles hanging on the
    chain around her neck.
  103: Mira's the name. What'll ya have, stranger?
  104: Hello again. What'll it be?
  105: Drink.
  106: Vault 13?
  107: GECK?
  108: I don't care. Give me the house special.
  109: Gimme a beer
  110: Information.
  111: I'm looking for work.
  112: Well, aren't you the one! Just the way I like them.
  113: Back again?
  114: Yubba.
  115: Whoa - ya just worked Lenny. Immmpressive! Have a drink on the house.
  116: What ya did to Lenny - it was wicked!
  117: Oh my, a stunning conversationalist. What'll ya take - a Rad-A-Waster? Only
    ten bucks.
  118: Yes.
  119: No.
  120: You gonna buy a drink? $10.
  121: Yes.
  122: No.
  123: One Rad-A-Waster coming up! $10.
  124: Okay.
  125: Ten bucks? Too much for me.
  126: Sure, one buck.
  127: Okay.
  128: Too much money for me.
  129: You might try Merk in the back room.
  130: There's nothing for you here, stranger.
  131: Thanks, I guess.
  132: So, that it, stranger?
  133: Vault 13?
  134: GECK?
  135: Got a little time for some questions?
  136: Me go bye-bye.
  137: That's all.
  138: Get outta here, ya deadbeat!
  139: Sure, I got some time. That's what bartenders are supposed to do. Just don't
    get no ideas.
  140: For you, I always got time, baby. What ya want?
  141: Sure.
  142: Tell me about this town.
  143: Ever heard of Vault 13?
  144: I'm looking for a thing called a GECK. Know anything about it?
  145: What's the deal on this Merk guy?
  146: There's this cop in town saying some pretty harsh things about you. What's
    the deal?
  147: Well, that kills that idea.
  148: Name's NCR. Used to be Shady Sands, but after the Master's defeat, Aradesh
    and the others founded the Republic. Now, NCR sits right on the border. Everything
    south of here's Republic ruled.
  149: Word of advice. Keep your nose clean in town. Courts aren't too friendly to
    our types, if you know what I mean. Citizens got more rights than you.
  150: Look, that's all I got to say about that.
  151: Hmm.
  152: A few more questions...
  153: Well, thanks. I'll remember that.
  154: Ya another one them whackos looking for lost treasure? Ya ought to go see Saltbeef
    Bob over at Westin's Ranch. He's always talking about treasure. Ya may have to
    wet his whistle though.
  155: Saltbeef? Me go.
  156: A few more questions...
  157: Well, thanks. I'll remember that.
  158: Ya tell me how to mix it and I'll pour it for ya.
  159: No drink. GECK is....GECK.
  160: It's not a drink. It's a Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
  161: A few more questions...
  162: Well, thanks. I'll remember that.
  163: He's a great guy. He's my boss. What ya expect me to say?
  164: A few more questions...
  165: Well, thanks. I'll remember that.
  166: That bastard....It was just a messy divorce, that's all.
  167: Well, how about we talk about something else?
  168: Well, I guess I'll be going.
  169: Oh, very informative. Look, ya might try Dr. Henry in town, but I got other
    things to do, Dumbo.
  170: 'Garden of Eden Creation Kit? Sounds technical. Ya might try looking up Dorothy,
    the city engineer. '
  171: A few more questions...
  172: Well, thanks. I'll remember that.
  173: Hmm -- work? Want job? Help Mira?
  174: Yes.
  175: No.
  176: Listen -bad man hurt Mira. Bad man name Jack. Hurt bad man. Mira like ya, give
    ya nice gun. Good?
  177: Yes.
  178: No.
  179: Good! Mira have rope over wall. Go night. Find rope. Sneak in. Go big place
    by gate. Find Jack. Hurt Jack. Mira give ya gun.
  180: Go night. Find rope. Sneak in. Go big place by gate. Find Jack. Hurt Jack.
    Mira give ya gun. Now go away. Me be seen with ya - not good. Help Mira and come
    back. Understand?
  181: Mira hear Jack got hurt. Good work, Dumbo. Here gun, ya take. Thanks.
  182: Screw ya, too. I'm never gonna be free of that bastard.
  183: You need to talk to Merk, but he’s not here. Come back at night. That’s more
    his time.
  184: I don't know what you did to Lenny, but I wouldn't hang around here. It ain't
    gonna make you to popular.
  185: Hey, I warned you. Oh, well. ..
  186: You're Mira, right? Some cop was saying something about you.
  187: You Mira? Bad Jack say things.
  188: That bastard Jack? What'd he say now?
  189: Jack dead. Go boom.
  190: Me kill. Him bad man.
  191: I wouldn't worry about it. He's dead. Blew himself up at the power station.
  192: Not much now. I killed him.
  193: You're kidding? That's the best news I've had all day! I hope his brains made
    nice wallpaper. Damn psycho deserved it. Have a Rad-a-Waster on me.
  194: Me like.
  195: Me go now.
  196: Thanks - I guess. Say, got time for a question?
  197: Thanks. Just figured you ought to know.
  198: You did what? Oh, if I wasn't on duty, I'd climb over this bar and... well,
    kiss you. The little prick deserved it. In fact, don't tell anyone but I was hoping
    to get some stupid ox to do the job for me. Had a little reward all set aside.  It's
    yours now - as far as I'm concerned you earned it.
  199: Thanks - I guess. Say, got time for a question?
  200: Thanks. Just figured you ought to know.
  201: Dumbo, you've made me the happiest woman around! I got a little present for
    you, right here behind the bar. It's all yours.
  202: Me like Mira.
  203: Me like gun. Me go bye bye.
scmrkgrd:
  100: Looks like another guy who thinks more with his fists than his head.
  101: Hmmm. One of Merk's guards.
  102: Big. Tough. Dumb. Bodyguard.
  103: Stand back. Give Mr. Merk his space.
  104: Uhh...
  105: I'm not supposed to talk to anybody on duty.
  106: You give us trouble, that's what I'm here for. Understand?
  107: Why don't you move on out, okay?
  108: Don't bother me.
  109: Mr. Merk doesn't want to be disturbed.
scofjack:
  100: You see a man wearing a badge of the NCR police.
  101: It's Jack, assistant deputy of the NCR law.
  102: This guy's wound tighter than a watch spring. His jaw is permanently clenched,
    the veins stand out on his forehead, and there's not a spot of joy or happiness
    anywhere on him.
  103: I don't want to hear your troubles right now. Take it to somebody else.
  104: You know, I don't have to put up with this - from you or anybody.
  105: Damn ex-wife took me for everything I had.
  106: She made a fool out of me, you know. Nobody makes a fool out of Jack.
  107: One of these days I'll show her. I'll show everybody...
  108: What you looking at? Scram!
  109: Bite me! This is Jack! People better listen to me now!
  110: I got a bomb in here so don't try anything!
  111: People always laughing at Jack, calling him Whack Jack - well who's laughing
    now?
  112: I'm counting to three and if Mira ain't here by then, I'll blow the place.
    One...
  113: Two...
  114: Three....
  115: What do you want? What are you staring at me for?
  116: Leave me alone, understand?
  117: Damn ex-wife - it's all her fault.
  118: Stay back! I've got a bomb!
  119: Don't do this, Jack. There's always a better solution.
  120: Uhh - stop.
  121: Yeah, sure. What would you know about this?
  122: I know things sometimes look bad, but blowing things up doesn't solve anything.
  123: Nothing. I don't know crap about your problems. Maybe you better tell me.
  124: What is this - some kind of trick? Stall Jack until his buddies come to kill
    him?
  125: Who wants to kill you?
  126: Don't worry, nobody's going to hurt you.
  127: That damn bitch of my ex-wife, Mira, for one. She wants me dead.
  128: So let the law deal with her. Not this way, Jack.
  129: You're right. She hired me to kill you. So what do you say? How about it, Jack?
  130: Who the hell's Mira?
  131: All right, you bastard. Let's do it!
  132: What a joke! I am the law. Look what good it's done.
  133: Jack, think about this.
  134: So blowing up the powerplant is going to fix Mira?
  135: Like I said. My ex. I catch her sleeping around and now she's saying I'm the
    bad guy. Got the court to give her everything and she's still trying to screw
    me.
  136: Whoa - that's hard. Completely unfair.
  137: You can recover. Everything passes with time. She'll forget about you.
  138: Sure...No. Crap, I don't know. I gotta do something. Let people know they can't
    go walking all over Jack.
  139: They know, Jack. Look at them. You blow yourself up now and they won't respect
    you at all.
  140: Look, think this through. Blow this place up and it'll just prove everything
    she says about you.
  141: No kidding, Sherlock. Now folks are going to listen to me.
  142: Nobody's going to listen to you with a bomb in your hands. Put it down, come
    on out, and we can get this settled.
  143: Look, think this through. Blow this place up and and folks will say, "Jack
    took the weak way. Let himself get pushed around by his ex-wife." She wins, you
    lose.
  144: You really think so?
  145: Yes, Jack. It's true.
  146: Of course. What do you think - I'm lying?
  147: I don't know.
  148: Don't let her win, Jack.
  149: Now's your chance. Be the big man. Really stand her down.
  150: Screw it. You're just full of it. You don't care about me!
  151: Ah hell, maybe you're right. This wasn't the greatest idea anyway.
  152: I would've done it, you know.
  153: Damn Mira, now she'll get hers.
  154: Now people know who Jack is, that's for sure.
  155: Just back off! I don't want to hurt you!
  156: This don't concern you!
  157: Go ahead, kill me. What do I care anymore?
  158: This isn't your fight. Leave me alone.
  159: I either blow up or you kill me. What's it matter?
  160: I'm not trying to hurt you! Just want them to remember...
  161: 'You gain '
  162: " experience for taking care of Jack for Mira."
scoswald:
  100: You see a man in dirty, blood-stained clothes.
  101: It's the squatter prisoner they've caught.
  102: His face and arms have a cross hatch of old knife scars and there's a crazed
    look in his eyes that says he's a brawler and an outlaw.
  103: You're wasting your time. I ain't got word one to say to you or anybody else.
  104: Go away and leave me alone, pig.
  105: Does it suddenly smell bad in here?
  106: What are you gonna do - scare me into talking?
  107: You don't scare me.
  108: 'Why don''t you just kiss my boots? '
  109: What the hell? You're trying to kill me! Guard!
  110: Talk or me kill you.
  111: Ain't nobody coming to help you. If you want to live, you talk.
  112: Okay, okay! What do you want to know? Just don't hurt me again.
  113: Vault 15 - you tell.
  114: What do you know about Vault 15?
  115: Look, I'm just a guy, not the guy in charge - that's Darion. He's the one you
    want. He's got this thing about Shady Sands and that old bitch Tandi. He's got
    a hideout in Vault 15, even got the locals thinking he's on their side.  That's
    all I know. Honest!
  116: Really, I don't know anything else! I told you everything I know, really! Don't
    hurt me any more.
  117: No way! I’m not falling for this trick. BANG! – shot down while escaping. Forget
    it!
scpeaon:
  100: You see a town inhabitant.
  101: You see the local one of the local folk.
  102: There is nothing mentionable about the way this person looks.
  103: Ahhh, leave me.
  104: I am sorry. I won't do it again.
  105: I was just leaving.
  106: Guards, he's back!
  107: Please leave me alone.
  108: Look, I don't want to be around you either.
  109: You are just evil. Please don't talk to me.
  110: Leave our children alone.
  111: You're some kind of sick criminal. I hope the guards get you.
  112: Just go away, okay?
  113: Hey, you shouldn't kill anyone - especially kids.
  114: I don't think I like you.
  115: Hey, just let me know when you are going to go postal.
  116: I have to go.
  117: Who the hell do you think you are - coming into this town?
  118: Just leave before anyone gets hurt.
  119: I don't like you.
  120: The just will kill all like you.
  121: What's your problem?
  122: Can't we all just get along?
  123: Don't talk to me.
  124: Whatever it is tell someone else.
  125: I don't think you're all that tough.
  126: Why don't you just leave?
  127: Well I have to get some eggs.
  128: Do you know how to put tin siding up?
  129: Hello, there.
  130: Please don't bother me, I am really busy.
  131: I wonder if there are any more brahmin burgers at Dusty's.
  132: Sometimes I wonder where I am headed.
  133: Umm, thanks, I really have to be going.
  134: Mabe later we can do lunch.
  135: Ohh, yeah, you are the new guy in town.
  136: You should talk to the sheriff.
  137: Hear they're going to be building some new houses soon.
  138: Town's been pretty quiet since Dumont got elected.
  139: Good day, stranger.
  140: Pretty quiet place we got here. Nice, eh?
  141: New in town? Check out my cousin Duppo's place.
  142: I hear times is hard down south. When's the government gonna do something?
  143: You from the north? Don't get many norther's here.
  144: I heard everybody from the wasteland's a mutant or a savage!
  145: No time for chat. Got to get to work.
  146: Are they having a sale at Duppo's? Oh, never mind.
scratch:
  100: It's a heap of rags that might have a person under it.
  101: You see Ratch, probably picking at some lice.
  102: It could be a human. It might be a mutant. All you can tell for sure is that
    it smells really, really bad.
  103: Junk for sale, junk for sale. Look it over, make me an offer.
  104: Sure, whatever.
  105: Uh...huh.
  106: So what's for sale?
  107: You look like you're good with your hands. You do have hands, don't you?
  108: I got $5. You got any good gossip?
  109: Goodbye.
  110: See that one there? That's my favorite - that one's Edna. I name all my stuff,
    see - they're like chidlren to me. I hate having to sell 'em, but I got to eat.
  111: You're messing with all my children!
  112: Yeah, right. Here's a fiver. You know any good gossip?
  113: O-kay - aren't you just special! Maybe I should shop someplace else.
  114: Let me look at your stock again.
  115: I think me and Edna will be going now.
  116: Well, thank god that stranger didn't take you child...My stuff is like my children,
    see.
  117: Uhh - of course.
  118: Well, I think I'll be going now.
  119: I can fix up all sorts of stuff. Got me blower, named it Claudia, fit most
    any car - give it a lot more power. Only $1000. You interested?
  120: Dummy, we already talked about that.
  121: You bet, Claudia's my kind of - whatever.
  122: Maybe something else.
  123: Heard tell there's a doc here in town, says he's got some miracle cure. I ain't
    taking it though...
  124: Then there's Saltbeef. Old coot says he's found a gold mine...
  125: Miss Dorothy and Toto was out here last week, looking for some parts to fix
    the powerplant. I couldn't help them, though...
  126: There's talk in town that what happened to Westin wasn't no accident. Some
    folks thinking there's too many suspicious strangers around...
  127: Thanks for the money, but I don't know anything more.
  128: Here's another fiver.
  129: Can I see your stuff?
  130: Well, thanks for the info.
  131: Well, gimme six hours. I should have it fixed up by then.
  132: Before you do, a little more of your time.
  133: Good enough. I'll see you later.
  134: Look, if you get the cash, come back. I'll probably still have it.
  135: Fair enough.
  136: Goodbye.
  137: There she is! Claudia's all installed.
  138: Gimme a little more time. I'm still working on the cussed thing.
  139: Whoa! I don't think I've got a spare brain for you.
scrawpat:
  100: Looks like yet another barfly.
  101: Same drunk you saw last time.
  102: Doesn't look like the nicest of people, but with that much booze, who does?
  103: Look, I'm just drinking. Leave me alone.
  104: I don't talk to strangers. Bad for your health in this bar.
  105: I've heard about you. Damn, but aren't you in the wrong place!
  106: You want trouble? Go talk to Merk.
  107: Hey, good-looking, you want to go some place private and have a little fun?
  108: Don't talk to me! I don't want another beating.
  109: Damn cheap whiskey! You know, they serve the worst liquor here.
  110: Shit! I didn't mean to spill my drink on you. Let me clean that up. Sorry,
    sorry.
  111: Stay away from me!
  112: I've heard about you. Please don't hit me.
  113: New in town? Word is Merk's looking for some tough hombres.
  114: What are you, some kind of tough guy? Get outta my face!
  115: They shouldn't never have done that. Someday stranger, I'll have a gun and
    then I'll show 'em.
  116: How'd you like to be my love slave, pretty?
  117: Drinking and talking - hell, nothing exciting ever happens in this town.
  118: Go away, you're bothering me.
  119: Did you hear the one about...
  120: So I says to him, "Look," I says...
  121: Try the roasted mole-rat. It's the best around.
  122: Hi. What's your sign?
  123: If you're looking for work, stranger, go down to the Stockmen's.
  124: Shit! Did you see that?
  125: Oh man, I'm going to be sick.
  126: No more for me.
  127: Hey, mix me one of those!
  128: I had a Rad-a-Waster like that once...
scrobo:
  100: You see a strange half-dog, half-metal thing. It appears to be activated.
  101: It's Robodog! Everybody's favorite pet!
  102: Either this thing is some horrible stitched together combination of dog and
    machine or it's all machine, cunningly done to look like a dog. It's hard to tell.
  103: Arf! <click> Woof!
  104: "...bzzzzzz..."

  120: Arf-arf-arf-arf-arf-arf-arf!
  121: OK
  122: I don't think I want to rejoin you just yet. Goodbye.
  123: Rowf? <boing> Raggy?
  124: How are you?
  125: I need you to wait here until I come back.
  126: That's it for now.

  128: Never mind.
  129: OK
  130: 'HP:'
  131: Cyberdog can't be repaired anymore at this time.

  1800: Arf-arf proximity set to medium.
  1900: Arf-arf proximity set to far.

  2200: Woof! Wo-wo-wo-<click>woof?
  2204: Ok your at a good distance for now.
scrondo:
  100: You see a man in grease-stained clothes, probably a mechanic.
  101: It's Rondo, owner of this joint.
  102: You think he's a mechanic, but he is wearing a sidearm which does seem a little
    odd.
  103: Greetings, ranger. Time's been good, I hope.
  104: Someday we'll wipe out those slavers.
  105: Well (player name), the rest are in back.
  106: Sorry, we're out of business.
  107: This is private property. Do you mind?
  108: I'm not taking any more work right now, okay?
  109: Hey, bastard, you shouldn't mess with the Rangers.
  110: Touch any of my stuff again and I am going to have to open up ole' bessy on
    you.
scsalbob:
  100: You see an old grubby man with stringy hair.
  101: It's the guy they call Saltbeef Bob
  102: He's got about three teeth and a face criss-crossed with the little veins of
    a drunkard. He smells bad too.
  103: Howdy, stranger!
  104: Gruh?
  105: Who are you?
  106: Name's Bob. Saltbeef Bob, yep. How about you?
  107: What'd you say your name was again, stranger? I'm Saltbeef Bob.
  108: "[Player name]"
  109: Saltbeef? What kind of name is that?
  110: What are you doing here?
  111: That's a right fine name, yep. Say, you wouldn't have a drink on ya, pardner?
  112: Yes.
  113: No.
  114: Get away from me, you stinking bum!
  115: Well, there warn't no need to be rude about it. Just wanted a little sip, see.
    Steady my nerves...
  116: Hoo-wee! Sounds like you got yerself some mighty fine hooch there! Say, hows
    about sharing a little? Just a little sip.
  117: Drink! Good!
  118: Grrrg!
  119: Easy, pardner! Can't blame a man fer asking, can ya? I'll just leave you be
    then.
  120: |-
    (Gulp, gulp, gulp) Aaaahhhh! That's right fine of you, stranger! Fine person, indeed. Kind a man should have as his pardner. (Gulp)

    Did I ever tell you about the time I made my big strike?
  121: No?
  122: Hey, quit drinking all my booze!
  123: Rahhhg!
  124: It was back in '78 and me and Bessie - best 'bot a man ever had - we was u-ra-ni-um
    prospecting west o' here. We hadn't turned up a rad's worth o' beans when all
    of a sudden five - no, I'm sure it was ten - deathclaws jumped us.
  125: They fought like hellcats. I fired so much I melted down my rifle barrel and
    was going at 'em knife to claw when old Bessie finally fused her last circuit
    board. Well, I tried to save her, but it warn't no use. Finally had to cut and
    run, keeping 'em off with rocks all the way.
  126: Well, things looked bad when I stumbled into this cave. Thought I was a goner
    fer sure. Figured it was their lair - but I had me my torch so I went inside.
    Hoo-wee, it was a deep cave. And that's when I saw it.
  127: It was a great big door, like them kinds you see in the old video flics. Big
    and made o' steel. An on it was carved a great, big 13!
  128: I knew I'd found it, the mother lode, the Vault 13. I sat right down and made
    me a map. Damn near died getting out o' there, past them deathclaws and then the
    sun o' the desert and no water.
  129: By the time I staggered into Shady Sands, I was mostly dead. Took me to the
    doc and fixed me up, but that doc stole my map. I knows it and that's all I gots
    to say.
  130: "(Continue)"
  131: Tarnation, it's a good and honest name, is what it is! The boys let me do some
    cooking around here and if you weren't such a tinhorn you'd know that and know
    to respect yer elders.
  132: Sorry, old-timer didn't mean to rile you.
  133: Well bite me, old timer!
  134: Rile me? Rile me! You ain't seen me riled yet! Now jes' git outta my sight
    before you gets me really upset! Gwan! Git!
  135: |-
    Well bite me, too! Now yer talking. Don't take no lip from nobody, pardner!

    Say, you got any hooch on ya? Just a little sip?
  136: Yes.
  137: No.
  138: Get away from me you, stinking bum!
  139: Hee, hee, hee! It's mine now, pardner. You'll jes' have to find yer own!
  140: Boss let's me stay here. I run this stable! Do a little cleaning, keep a square
    camp.
  141: Saltbeef? What kind of name is that?
  142: Pleased to meet you. I'm
  143: Hell and thunder, you again? Git yer scrawny ass outta my sight!
  144: Bite me!
  145: You're a fiesty one, old timer
  146: Damn right I am! You don't have a little drink on you, do you now? Fer an old
    man.
  147: Yes.
  148: No.
  149: Get away from me you stinking bum!
  150: "."
scsherif:
  100: You see a gray haired man in the uniform of the NCR police.
  101: It's the sheriff of NCR.
  102: This guy's about as regulation as they come - crew cut and square-jawed, a
    real no-nonsense kind of guy.
  103: Welcome to NCR, stranger. Name's Dumont - Sheriff Dumont. Hope you're having
    a nice peaceful time here.
  104: Take a word of advice from Sheriff Dumont, stranger - this town don't care
    for your kind. Any trouble and I come down hard. Now, is there anything I can
    do for you?
  105: Hello again. Anything I can do for you?
  106: Well, spit it out.
  107: Urrrgh.
  108: I'm looking for Vault 13. Do you know where it is?
  109: Do you have a GECK?
  110: I'm looking for some honest work. Can you help me?
  111: Oh, fine. Everything's been just peachy.
  112: Primitive, eh? You. Questions? Ask me. Okay?
  113: Vault 13?
  114: GECK?
  115: Okay.
  116: No, I don't. That's something even President Tandi would like to know. Solve
    a lot of problems.
  117: Problems?
  118: President Tandi?
  119: Great. Just my luck. Thanks.
  120: Listen, I lead a clean and wholesome life! I don't have GECK or anything else.
  121: So-rry! What do you know about Vault 13?
  122: We'll just forget I asked. I'll leave you alone now.
  123: I can think of a couple of things, if you're really interested.
  124: You're joking right? After what you did with Jack? I suppose you could find
    some steady work.
  125: Like what?
  126: No, let's just change the subject.
  127: Forget it, I've changed my mind. Goodbye.
  128: No Vault 13. Vault 15, yes.
  129: Fif-teen?
  130: No. Thir-teen!
  131: Yes, 15! You talk Tandi. Big chief NCR. Tandi know Vault. Want help. You go
    Tandi.
  132: Tandi?
  133: No go. Want 13!
  134: Lis-ten. No Vault 13. No find. No see. No 13. Vault 15 - people find. People
    live Vault 15. You understand?
  135: No thir-teen? Fif-teen?
  136: NO. WANT THIRTEEN!
  137: Arrgh! THERE IS NO 13, YOU DUMB BOX OF ROCKS! No 13. No find. Never! Ever!
  138: Tandi big chief. Tandi want help. You talk to Tandi. Go Con-gress house. Okay?
  139: GECK?
  140: Okay.
  141: No GECK. Me healthy. Not sick.
  142: Vault 13?
  143: Okay.
  144: Look around you. NCR's a growing place. We need parts, computers, whatnot.
    Been a problem ever since those squatters moved into Vault 15.
  145: Vault 15? Squatters? What's going on?
  146: What's this about President Tandi?
  147: Thanks for the info.
  148: President of NCR, who else? Things have got her so worried she even asked to
    borrow one of my deputies for a special mission. Hated to turn her down, but I
    can't spare the manpower.
  149: How about me? Maybe you could recommend me.
  150: Hmm. Tough life, I guess.
  151: You? Hmmm....I couldn't. Don't even know you - but she's looking to hire somebody
    so you can go talk to her yourself. Her office is in the Hall of Congress.
  152: Thanks. I'll do that.
  153: Know anything about a GECK?
  154: Well, that's damn fine of you, stranger - and damn presumptuous, too. I don't
    know you from Adam and Eve and I don't like the way you look!  I'm not recommending
    you to anybody. Now, I got work to do.
  155: Well, there's Duppo at the Stockmen's. He does the hiring for the brahmin drives.
    Then there's Mr. Westin. If you talk to him, tell him I sent you. Even President
    Tandi's been asking around for some help.
  156: Duppo up at the Stockmen's Association wrangles hands for the brahmin drives.
    Go try him.
  157: Westin?
  158: President Tandi?
  159: Got to go.
  160: Roger Westin. His spread's just out the west gate. He's been having some problem
    with varmits. He'd take care of it himself, but his health ain't what it used
    to be. Bad ticker, Doc Jubilee says.
  161: Yeah?
  162: Any work to be had in this town?
  163: Never mind. I'm going.
  164: Just make sure things stay that way. Goodbye.
  165: That's a damn fine piece of work you did with old Jack, stranger. As the sheriff,
    I'll take if from here.
  166: He's all yours.
  167: What about a reward?
  168: Well, I can't say that I've got any reward money to give. Best I can do is
    my thanks.
  169: Wait. I've got some questions.
  170: Oh, I understand all right.
  171: Sorry, can't talk right now. I'm already late for the coroner's inquest. Seems
    pretty clear cut to me.
  172: Sorry, no crime, no time.
  173: Desert rats. You got to understand – this town traces its roots back to 15.
    Seems there was some trouble there a long time ago and the survivors founded Shady
    Sands. So by right, Vault 15 is our property. Few years back some squatters moved
    in and there’s been trouble ever since. You should talk to Tandi about it.
  174: Tandi?
  175: I’ll take that under advisement.
  176: There is no more work that I am aware of.
  177: Duppo up at the Stockmen's Association wrangles hands for the brahmin drives.
    President Tandi's been asking around for some help.
  178: Anyone else of your stature would be leaving town, much less look for work.
  179: Duppo up at the Stockmen's Association wrangles hands for the brahmin drives.
    Go try him. Then there's Mr. Westin. If you talk to him, tell him I sent you.
scskeete:
  100: You see a thin-looking punk.
  101: It's Doofus, the car hop.
  102: This guy's a ragged little weed, full twitches and tics, no doubt a reliance
    on something.
  103: That's fine transport, man, truly fine! Oh man, I am the one for you - watch
    your car, keep it safe from the bedbugs. Five bucks, no problem.  Five bucks and
    Doofus is on the job! Never sleep - 24 hour, always there, man.
  104: I am the car hop, man. I watch cars -  $5. Nobody touches them, cause Doofus's
    on the job.
  105: Right, sure man.
  106: So man, you want my protection?
  107: Good. Do..
  108: No. You no touch.
  109: I am not a man!
  110: What place is this?
  111: Deal. $5 - you watch the car.
  112: Get lost, skuzz!
  113: Whoa man, there's like this giant talking to me! Is that so cool or what?
  114: Gurg?
  115: I am not a man!
  116: What place is this?
  117: That's right. I'm a really powerful giant! You will obey me.
  118: Useless junkie - get lost!
  119: What do you want with Doofus, man?
  120: Whoa, we met before? What can I do for you?
  121: Right, sure man.
  122: Squa?
  123: I am not a man!
  124: What do you do?
  125: What is this place?
  126: Nothing. Thought you were somebody else. Bye.
  127: Whoa, man, I warned you. Bad place. Bad folks around here. Heard your transport
    got jacked.
  128: Brak?
  129: How did you know?
  130: Great. Thanks. Fine.
  131: Doofus will perform, man. Not even a fly is gonna land his shit on your au-to-mo-bile!
  132: What is this place?
  133: Good. Shut up.
  134: If you ain't got the jack, just get the fuck out of here! I got important things
    to do.
  135: Hey man, Doofus warned you.
  136: Fuck you. I not answering your questions.
  137: What is this place?
  138: Goodbye
  139: Bye-bye.
  140: Whoa, thought communication! I'm picking up mental vibes! Okay, let me try...
    uhhh.... Uhhh...
  141: Yes?
  142: No?
  143: You are a goddamn head case! I'm out of here.
  144: This is the NCR - the high, mighty, righteous, absolutely and always correct
    New California Republic. They are the ones who will lead people like us out of
    the wasteland and into the new and perfect future. Can you dig it?
  145: Let's get this business finished
  146: Yeah, thanks. Goodbye.
  147: Gurg, ladal spaf!
  148: TAK!
  149: Doof? Ganya kulk zar!
  150: Right - obey the giant, man. It the way things are supposed to be. What should
    I do, giant?
  151: Man that's a lot. Giant, I'm Doofus and I'm a car hop and I'm supposed to watch
    cars that people bring here, but, you know, I got this...thing, see, and sometimes
    I need a little extra money and stuff, see?
  152: Yeah, right. So like sometimes I'm a little short and I got my needs, understand,
    like when I start feeling sick, so I gotta score me some caps or something, so
    I'll go talk to Merk.
  153: Man, Merk's the man. He's got action and stuff. Sometimes he'll let me get
    sleep at the Rawhide after closing. But then he wants me to do little favors.
  154: I'm getting to that - wow, the colors, man!  Merk he sometimes wants stuff
    from cars I watch. But I fool him!
  155: |-
    See I only take from the cars I ain't paid to watch. He thinks I'm jacking my customers, but I don't do that.
       Man, I got to quit talking. I'm like seeing things...oh, man, the glow. It's all about glowing.
  156: Give me all your stuff.
  157: Tell me what you know.
  158: That's enough, I can't take any more.
  159: Oh, just shut up you dumb shit!
  160: Bye-bye.
  161: Oh, you know. Sometimes I hear things. I hear a lot; can't always remember
    it right.
  162: "$50 bucks says you remember it right."
  163: Remember or I blow your fucking head off.
  164: Screw this. I don't have time to waste with a junkie.
  165: That's right, man. Go see Merk. He's always got things that need doing.

  167: Oh man, you blew it! Merk's not going to be happy when he hears this.
  168: Goodbye, dope-head
  169: Okay! Look it was Merk's crew. They were jacking cars last night. Ask around
    and you might find them.
  170: You lie, me kill.
  171: Don't be lying. I'll be back if you are.
  172: Sure.  You've got me terrified.
  173: "$50 bucks says you remember it right."
  174: Bite me, stupid man.

scslaves:
  100: You see a miserable wretch of human being.
  101: You still see a miserable wretch of a human being.
  102: You see a really, really miserable wretch of a human being. Why are you staring?
  103: Help me! Please, don't turn your back on me.
  104: My master says I shouldn't talk to anybody.
  105: Let me tell you something - my master's a real asshole.
  106: Really, I don't mind being a slave. It's a good life - I get meals and my mistress
    is pretty good to me.
  107: Go away! Leave me alone!
  108: You! You've got to help us! Overthrow the oppressors!
  109: Don't talk to me! I don't want another beating.
  110: Slavery is just a mental construct. After all, are you really free?
  111: No more! Please, not the House of Pain!
  112: Stay away from me!
  113: Monster! You and your kind did this to me!
  114: The judgement of the Almighty shall fall upon you!
  115: I obey your every word.
  116: And the meek shall inherit the earth.
  117: I'll be good. I'm a good slave.
  118: Freedom! Sweet blessed freedom!
  119: Look what you've done - you've ruined my life!
  120: Can't stop. Gotta run. Can't let them catch me.
  121: Shit! I doomed - they're gonna hunt me down and kill me.
  122: Where do I go now? What do I do?
  123: Thanks a lot. Now I got some slaver blood to spill.
  124: I don't believe it - I'm free!
scslvgrd:
  100: Big guy - gun  -- standing around. Guard.
  101: Still a guard.
  102: He's got a slaver tattoo on his forehead, which doesn't make him look any brighter.
  103: Talk to Mr. Vortis, not me.
  104: Uhh...
  105: You got questions? Talk to Vortis.
  106: You give us trouble, that's what I'm here for. Understand?
  107: Well, we got ourselves an intruder.
  108: Sound the alarm. Intruder on the premises!
  109: Mr. Vortis - raiders!
  110: Oh, you've made a big mistake.
scslvovr:
  100: You see a stocky man with a submachine gun slung under his arm.
  101: It's the slave overseer.
  102: Well, from his tattoo you know he's a slaver. Looks like he's in charge of
    the guards around here.
  103: What the hell are you? Some kind of burglar?
  104: NCR meddling do-gooder! I got a cure for you.
  105: Vortis, we've got an intruder!
  106: Guards! Alert!
  107: What do you want?
  108: Kurg?
  109: What is this place?
  110: The Rangers sent me.
  111: I'm looking for the owner.
  112: Brother slaver, I've got a few questions.
  113: Sorry, wrong guy.
  114: Go on, get out of here. I've already got enough idiot guards!
  115: What are you chump, blind? This is a slave pen. You want to know more, talk
    to Vortis.
  116: It that so? Well, I'm sending you back in a body bag.
  117: That'd be Vortis, the old guy.
  118: Thanks. Say, you seem like a bright guy. I'll bet you can help me out with
    a few questions
  119: The old guy, eh? Okay.
  120: Well now, you put it that way, I can't really say no. What's on your mind?
  121: Thanks, stranger.
  122: I know more than old Vortis gives me credit for, you know.
  123: Well, I've done a lot more than most people suspect. Like this job, though.
    It's nice and cushy.
  124: Whatever.
  125: What's the deal with these Rangers I hear about?
  126: I'm looking for Vault 13. Ever hear of it?
  127: Ever hear of a GECK?
  128: Know anything about an outfit called the Enclave?
  129: I'm looking for work. Know anybody who's hiring?
  130: Forget it. I don't want to take up your time.
  131: Those bastards killed my brother and then said it was for the good of the people!  I
    want them dead. If you can help, talk to Vortis.
  132: Sounds like a good idea to me.
  133: Vortis, eh? You're a fountain of wisdom. What else do you know?
  134: Right. Think I'll do that right now.
  135: Everybody's heard of Vault 13. When I was a kid, me and my friends used to
    go prospecting for it. Supposed to be east of here, so we searched everything
    but never did find it.
  136: I'm sure you tried hard. I'd like to ask some more questions, since you know
    so much.
  137: Well, I got to go.
  138: GECK, eh? Back when I was studying Vault tech, I read about those. Supposedly
    every vault got one and it was supposed to be the first thing used once a vault
    got opened. They say that's how Shady Sands got its start - from a GECK. That
    help at all?
  139: You studied vault tech? Impressive. Say, I got some more questions for you.
  140: Well, I got to go.
  141: The Enclave.... You know, there's a doc in town, goes by the name of Henry.
    One night when he was drunk he started going on about some guys he called the
    Enclave.
  142: That's just what I needed to know. You are a well-informed man.
  143: That's all I need bother you with. Thanks.
  144: Me, I'm always on the lookout - problem is, nobody ever wants to hire a slaver
    anymore. Vortis, my boss, has got something hush-hush. And in town the ranchers
    at the Stockmen's Association are always hiring plus Dorothy can always use a
    hand at the powerplant if you got skills. Word is even President Tandi's looking
    for a specialist.
  145: Man, you know a lot. I could spend all day asking you questions.
  146: Well, I'll get right on these leads.
  147: You cut their... you knows... off for me, okay?
  148: No problem. There's some other stuff I'd like to know, though.
  149: I'll take care of them, don't worry.
sctoto:
  100: It's a big robot with tools and stuff.
  101: That's Toto, Dorothy's maintainence robot.
  102: It's a robot, maintainence model.
  103: Bzzz...Arf, arf!...Bzzt. Click... Arf!
  104: Woof. Woof.
  105: "(Pant, pant) Bzzt...Woof. Grrrrrr."
scvortis:
  100: You see a scrawny old guy with a pen stuck behind his ear and spectacles balanced
    on the end of his nose.
  101: It's Vortis, the owner of this slave pen.
  102: He's got about three teeth. His fingers and shirt are stained with blue ink.
    There's a really faded slaver's tattoo on his forehead.
  103: So what do you want?
  104: Brother, welcome to Vortis' hall. How can I help you?
  105: You're starting to annoy me.
  106: This place is my place and I, Vortis, run an honest and legitimate busines
    no matter what anybody in NCR tells you. Since NCR doesn't allow slaves inside
    the gates, I mind them for folks who've got business inside.
  107: What are you, dense? This is a slave pen. I got licenses for it.
  108: "[]"
  109: Just got some questions.
  110: I'm looking for work.
  111: Uh?
  112: Not outhouse? Me go away.
  113: What's this place do?
  114: Nothing. Wrong place.
  115: Oh, look - the goody two-shoes, lollipop kid. Boys, escort this hypocritical
    paragon of saintly virtue out of my sight!
  116: Fuck this.
  117: Well?
  118: I'm looking for Vault 13.
  119: Do you have a GECK?
  120: What can you tell me about this town?
  121: You're slaver scum! Why shouldn't I kill you?
  122: I heard there's these guys - New California Rangers. They been giving you any
    trouble?
  123: Mind if I have a look around?
  124: Work? Well...there might be something. You ever hear of the New California
    Rangers?
  125: Yes.
  126: No.
  127: Fuck you. Boys, escort this annoying crud out of my sight.
  128: Bite me!
  129: Vault 13! Get outta here. Damn place is a myth. Vault 13, my ass.
  130: Another question...
  131: Well, thanks for nothing.
  132: A what? Well, whatever it is, I ain't got it.
  133: Another question...
  134: Well, thanks for nothing.
  135: New California Republic - nothing but temperance types and merchants. Got a
    bug about slavers and slavery, but what the hell, it makes my business.
  136: Another question...
  137: Thanks, got to go.
  138: Somebody steered you wrong. I don't have no trouble with nobody - especially
    not no Rangers. I'm all legal, so there ain't nothing on me.
  139: Another question...
  140: Whatever you say. I'll be going.
  141: Yeah, I may have some feelings about the Rangers. You looking for work?
  142: Yes.
  143: No.
  144: No, you may not go nosing around, shit-for-brains! This ain't a museum!
  145: Another question...
  146: You're too touchy for me. I'm leaving.
  147: Well then, you should know some folks see them as a potential problem. It would
    be extremely useful if we had a map of their safe houses through the north - New
    Reno, Klamath, wherever. I'd be willing to pay, oh say, $500 for something like
    that. You think you could get that for me?
  148: Sure.
  149: I don't think so.
  150: Let me tell you, then. These Rangers have got it in their heads to wipe out
    slavery and slavers - by force. They've been creating a lot of trouble for hard
    working folks.
  151: They work in secret, especially up north.
  152: Jeez, I got to spell this out for you? They raid slavers, drive off the stock,
    and smuggle 'em down south to NCR lands where slavery's illegal. So you interested?
  153: There is no "and"! You want the job or not?
  154: And?
  155: So what you want me to do?
  156: Fine. When you get me a map, I'll be here.
  157: Where am I going to find a map?
  158: Okay, I got some other questions, though.
  159: I'm on it. I'll see you then.
  160: How the hell should I know!? If I knew, I'd have it, wouldn't I? Look, there's
    supposed to be a cell in town. Find them and see what you can do.
  161: Just a few more questions.
  162: Alright. I'll be back.
  163: You're back again. Did you get that map?
  164: Yes.
  165: 'No'
  166: I'm still waiting for you to finish the first job!
  167: Oh yeah, I forgot
  168: Not since you did your job. Thanks.
  169: Just a question or two.
  170: No problem. Bye.
  171: Good work. Now you best make yourself scarce, in case those Rangers ever wise
    up.
  172: Pleasure doing business.
  173: Well don't hang around here, you moron! Somebody'll get suspicious.
  174: All right, I get the hint.
  175: What the fuck? Guards! We got an intruder!
  176: Go in there and I'll blow your head off. Understand?
scwesgrd:
  100: You see a guard.
  101: You see Grant, the guard
  102: You see a guard. His armor and weapons are in excellent condition.
  103: This is private property, please move along.
  104: Who live here?
  105: Ok, me go.
  106: Excuse me but who lives here?
  107: All right, I'll be going.
  108: Are you ready to leave?
  109: Me want go.
  110: No, me stay.
  111: Yes, I need to be going now.
  112: No, I'll hang around a bit longer.
  113: This is Westin Ranch, home of councilman Westin.
  114: Me need see.
  115: Ok. Bye.
  116: I need to see the councilman, please.
  117: I see. Well, I'll be on my way.
  118: What business do you have with Mr. Westin?
  119: Me need job.
  120: Just want chat.
  121: Uh...
  122: Nevermind.
  123: I'm looking for work and I hear that he's hiring.
  124: I would like to chat with Mr. Westin.
  125: Never mind, I'll come back later.
  126: Hmm... I seem to remember something about work being available. All right,
    come on in. Don't cause any trouble though, I'll be watching you.
  127: Me thank.
  128: Thanks.
  129: Mr. Westin doesn't just 'chat' with anyone who walks in off the street. If
    you don't have specific business with him then I suggest you leave until such
    time as you do. Now please go away.
  130: Done.
  131: "(sigh) I've heard that Mr. Westin has a soft spot for people like you. Come
    on in."
  132: Me thank you.
  133: Yeah, yeah. I am in the middle of something.
  134: Hey, get away from there!
  135: You should ask before you play with things that aren't yours.
  136: Hello. Did you need to see Mr. Westin again?
  137: Yes.
  138: No.
  139: Me have things from Vault City for Mr. Westin.
  140: I have something from Vault City for Mr. Westin.
  141: All right, come on in. Don't cause any trouble though, I'll be watching you.
  142: Your not allowed on to the ranch without official busniess.
scwestin:
  100: You see a man dressed in fancy ranch clothes.
  101: It's Councillor Westin.
  102: Silver and turquoise rings, silver belt buckle, pistol at his side, this guy's
    clearly used to having money and having his own way.
  103: I'm Roger Westin and you can't come barging in here. What do you want?
  104: You again? What do you want?
  105: What do you want?
  106: Duh...
  107: Me look Vault 13? You help?
  108: I'm looking for Vault 13. Can you help me?
  109: I finished your dirty work.
  110: Bad things come. Me scare off. Moo-moos safe.
  111: About your brahmin problem -- looks like all you've got to do is post a man
    out there. He doesn't even have to do anything, just be there. I know it sounds
    weird, but it will work. You mentioned some pay?
  112: I'm here about a job.
  113: First Citizen Lynette sends her greetings. She's got something for you.
  114: Bishop sent me.
  115: Oops.
  116: That all? Talk to my foreman, Felix.
  117: You don't understand. I'm here to do a job.
  118: The sheriff suggested I come talk to you personally.
  119: Fine. Be that way.
  120: I should have guessed. What did he promise you - money, chems, or sex? It doesn't
    matter. You'll never see any of it.
  121: What do you mean?
  122: Shut up.
  123: |-
    Oh - simple are you? What a sad thing. It must be a hard cross to bear.

    Listen - you go, talk to Fee-lix. He give you job. Savvy?
  124: Uh-huh.
  125: |-
    What do you think? You know too much. What if you come back to NCR and sell him out - or threaten to? You're as good as dead already.

    On the other hand, I've got a better offer.
  126: Such as?
  127: I don't believe you.
  128: Take out Bishop instead. I'll pay cash, whatever he was paying plus 50%. How
    much was it?
  129: "(need info from Chris)"
  130: "(Avellone, that is)"
  131: Fine.
  132: Deal.
  133: Too bad for you, old man.
  134: I look forward to hearing from you. Now, go out the way you came.
  135: Excellent. I knew you were the right person. Well, I promised you pay and I
    do not renege my deals. Here's your money.
  136: Anything else I can do for you?
  137: Thanks. Maybe you can help me out. I'm trying to find Vault 13.
  138: Goodbye.
  139: Dumont recommended you? Well, that's good enough for me. Something or someone
    has been raiding my brahmin at night. I need to find out what's up. How about
    going out there and looking into it for me? I'll pay you for your trouble.
  140: Sounds like easy work. I'll do it.
  141: I've decided against it.
  142: Something or someone has been raiding my brahmin at night. I need to find out
    what's up. How about going out there and looking into it for me? I'll pay you
    for your trouble.
  143: Sounds like a good idea. I'll do it.
  144: No thanks. Sitting in a field, waiting for some mantoid to show sounds boring.
  145: Excellent. Felix will guide you out there. Now, if you'll excuse me.
  146: Well, maybe I can. I've heard a lot of stories about Tandi and the Vaultdweller.
    Seems he saved her life years ago before NCR was even founded. Anyway, legend
    has it that he spent a lot of time exploring a vault east of here. If that isn't
    vault 13 then maybe you'll find a clue there that will lead you to it.
  147: Ooooh. Good.
  148: Thanks!
  149: Well, maybe I can. However, I need a favor from you first. Something, or someone,
    has been raiding my brahmin at night. I need to find out what's up. How about
    going out there and looking into it for me? I'll pay you for it and I'll tell
    you what I know.
  150: Sounds like a good idea. I'll do it.
  151: No thanks. Sitting in a field, waiting for some mantoid to show sounds boring.
  152: Well, then here you go. Nice to meet you, stranger.
  153: I'm not sure I believe you, but here's your pay. Hell, if you been lying, my
    boys will find you. I also said I'd give you some information, so here it is.
    I've heard a lot of stories about Tandi and the Vaultdweller. Seems he saved her
    life years ago before NCR was even founded. Anyway, legend has it that he spent
    a lot of time exploring a vault east of here. If that isn't Vault 13 then maybe
    you'll find a clue there that will lead you to it.
  154: Me tank you!
  155: Thanks.
  156: The 1st Citizen? Excellent, this is what I've been waiting for. Are you a Vault
    Citizen?
  157: Yes.
  158: No.
  159: And you're a good Citizen, I'm sure. I want you to take this holodisk back
    to the 1st Citizen. It's important. It has the information she needs to expose
    this NCR-New Reno plan.
  160: I have some other questions.
  161: Yes, sir.
  162: Well then, that's all.
  163: I have some other questions.
  164: Whatever.
  165: A job. You mean--
  166: Bishop sent me. Got a little message for you.
  167: Bye-bye and sleep tight, old man.
  168: dollars it is. You do the job, I pay you. You say no, you don't get out of
    here alive. Well?
  169: Ohh yeah. Well, I was having some problem with varmits, but they stopped coming
    around. Sorry about that. Try Felix and see if he has anything for you to do.
  170: Ok, thanks.
  171: Ehhh.... I have a bad heart condition... can't take...
  172: Must ..... ttteeeelll Feeellliixx.
  173: Wow, I guess he did have a heart problem.
  174: AHHAHH!!! AHAHAHHAH!!! AHHAHAH!!! IT BURNS!!!
scwrhand:
  100: You see a person wearing dusty work clothes.
  101: One of Westin's ranch hands.
  102: Could be just a ranch hand, but could be a hired killer, too. Certainly looks
    ready for trouble.
  103: You supposed to be wandering around here?
  104: Talk to Felix if you're looking for a job, stranger.
  105: I'm so sick of brahmin.
  106: I hear the Bishops got it in for our boss.
  107: You wanna talk to somebody, talk to the foreman, Felix.
  108: You ain't with the Bishops are you?
  109: We know it was murder. We catch the snake, his death won't be quick.
  110: Felix swears the Bishops was behind this. Says there's money in it for somebody.
  111: Well, guess it's time to be moving. Things gone to hell around here.
shtandi:
  100: You see an elderly woman, lean and weathered.
  101: You see Tandi, president of the NCR.
  102: You see a tough, self-confident woman. It's clear that she is used to the respect
    of others.
  103: I'm Tandi, president of NCR. My boys tell me you're looking for work. What
    are you handy at?
  104: Me good gun. One of best.
  105: Me good talk people.
  106: Me good fighter. Kick ass.
  107: Me sneaky. Get where want. No see or hear.
  108: Me got many talents.
  109: Uh, just stuff.
  110: I'm good with a gun. One of the best.
  111: I've been told, Madame President, that I have a way with words.
  112: I'm good at unarmed combat, up close and personal.
  113: I'm good at getting to where I need to go without being seen or heard.
  114: I have many talents, and they are all at your disposal.
  115: Just stuff I guess.
  116: Hmmm. You're not quite what I'm looking for. Sure you can handle yourself?
  117: Me not know. What job?
  118: Me believe in self. Me can do!
  119: That depends on the job you're offering.
  120: Yes, I'm confident in my abilities and myself.
  121: You sound like just what's needed.
  122: Good. How me help?
  123: Excellent, how can I help you?
  124: We need some computer parts from our old base - Vault 15. Problem is there's
    squatters there who won't let anybody by. Somebody has to convince 'em to let
    us in - or just bring back the parts. Up for the job?
  125: Me no like. Me go.
  126: Me do for you.
  127: Me been there. Squatters want deal. You teach, you help, they give you vault.
  128: Me been there. Me got parts.
  129: Me been there. Squatters want deal. You teach, you help, they give you vault.
    Here parts also.
  130: Sorry, this doesn't sound like my line of work.
  131: I'd be happy to help you out.
  132: I'm interested, but what's the job pay?
  133: I've handled most of this already. The squatters want a deal. You help them
    become self sufficient and they'll give you access to the vault.
  134: I've been there and I have the parts you're looking for.
  135: I've handled this already. The squatters want a deal. You help them become
    self sufficient and they'll give you the vault. Also, here are the parts.
  136: Hell and thunder... Your choice - but if you change your mind...
  137: Done.
  138: Fair enough. Do it right and there's a reward.
  139: Lord, I know I'm making a mistake but... give it a shot - if you understood
    anything I said.
  140: Ok. Me go.
  141: Me got questions.
  142: All right. I'm off.
  143: I'd like to ask you some questions.
  144: Well, I got a little time to spare.
  145: What do you want to know?
  146: What you tell about Vault 15?
  147: Why no make deal with squatters?
  148: You know where vault 13?
  149: Me look for geck. You have?
  150: What you tell about New Reno?
  151: What you tell about Frank Westin?
  152: What you tell about Carlson?
  153: Elder tell story. Talk about Vaultdweller, Tandi. You that Tandi?
  154: This Shadeesans Elder talk about?
  155: That all. Me go now.
  156: What can you tell me about vault 15?
  157: Why haven't you made a deal with the squatters?
  158: Do you know where vault 13 is?
  159: I'm looking for a geck. Would you happen to have one?
  160: What can you tell me about New Reno?
  161: What can you tell me about Frank Westin?
  162: What you can tell me about Carlson?
  163: The Elder tells a story about the Vaultdweller and someone named Tandi. Are
    you that Tandi?
  164: Is this the Shadeesands the Elder speaks of?
  165: That's all for now. I'll be going.
  166: It's just east of here, an underground shelter from the war. Most families
    in NCR came from it, so it's rightfully ours.
  167: Tell more.
  168: Go on.
  169: A couple of years ago some squatters moved in and built a shantytown on the
    surface. They call it 'The Squat.' They're nothing but dogs in the manger. They
    can't get into the vault but they keep us out.
  170: Me got more questions.
  171: I see. I need to ask you about a few other things.
  172: I tried. I sent some people down there but, after the first few, they stopped
    coming back. I can't prove the squatters are responsible either. My boys managed
    to capture one of 'em but he won't talk. Got 'em locked up downtown.
  173: Need know more.
  174: A few more questions please.
  175: Get to it. I can't spend the day with you.
  176: Ok, me hurry
  177: I'll try to be quick.
  178: With that suit you're wearing I figured you already knew.
  179: Suit been in village long time. Belong to Vaultdweller, tribe founder.
  180: This suit has been in our village since the beginning. It belonged to the Vaultdweller,
    our founder.
  181: You're serious aren't you? If we're talking about the same person, he saved
    my life. (snorts) Then vanished. When I start thinking it was only a dream, I
    go look at the statue out front.
  182: Statue?
  183: That's right. For scaring off the raiders. They kept clear of Shady Sands afterwards
    we got time to get ourselves set up. We made him a hero... even if we didn't believe
    a word about him coming from Vault 13.
  184: Me remember. Ask more?
  185: I'll keep that in mind. Can I ask you some more?
  186: Vault 13? Why are you asking?
  187: Me curious.
  188: Me Chosen One. Me descendant Vaultdweller.
  189: Not matter. Me ask questions.
  190: I've heard stories and I'm curious.
  191: I'm the Chosen One of my village. I am a descendant of the Vaultdweller.
  192: Never mind. I was just curious.
  193: It's just a damn myth like lost uranium mines. I did meet a stranger once who
    claimed to be from there. Lot of folks died trying to find that vault afterward.
  194: Vaultdweller real. Me descendant.
  195: Me need know more.
  196: The Vaultdweller was real. I'm one of his descendants.
  197: I see. Let me ask you about something else.
  198: A geck? Like the lizard? We got them all over.
  199: Not lizard... never mind. Me ask question.
  200: No, not the damn lizards... never mind. I need to ask you something else.
  201: New Reno? A damn bucket of brahmin spit. Got every vice there is. We've gotta
    be tough with them if we're going to unify this land. Congress has got to understand
    that.
  202: What know about Bishop?
  203: Tell about congress?
  204: Me ask more.
  205: What about the Bishops?
  206: Tell me about the congress.
  207: I see. Can you tell me some more?
  208: Well, I'll talk to a snake, but don't expect me to hug him. If you see 'em,
    you can tell 'em that too.
  209: Me hear NCR make deal with Bishop.
  210: Ok. Me need know more.
  211: Rumor has it that the NCR is making a deal with the Bishops.
  212: Ok, on to other things.
  213: No point trying to keep secrets around here. We're negotiating with New Reno
    for membership in the NCR. They should have some pull with places like Vault City.
  214: Me see.
  215: All right.
  216: Most figure we've got to work with New Reno one way or another. But folks like
    Westin and the ranchers blame New Reno for rustling the cattle drives between
    here and Redding.
  217: Humph.
  218: Who Westin?
  219: I see.
  220: Who is this Westin person?
  221: Congressman Westin? One of the biggest brahmin ranchers around. His spreads
    on the west side of town. Just don't bring up New Reno if you talk to him - it
    gets him going. If you're looking for a steady job... but you aren't that type,
    are you?
  222: No thanks.
  223: Stubborn as a mule... but a good man. Why?
  224: Me curious about work.
  225: Me curious about work.
  226: I'm curious about some work.
  227: I'm curious about some work.
  228: Seems to me that you've got enough on your plate already.
  229: OK. Never mind.
  230: Yeah, you're right.
  231: Ever since Westin died, Carlson's been holed up in his office. Probably won't
    see you, but you can talk to his boys.
  232: Ok.
  233: Listen. Lots of folks, me included, like old man Carlson even if we don't agree
    on New Reno. Something happens to him, we won't take kindly to it. Anyone thinking
    his or her life would be easier if he was gone is very, very wrong. Understand?
  234: Yeah. Me understand.
  235: Yes, I understand.
  236: Lord, that was a long time ago! Hardly remember who I was then - just a naпve
    girl. The one you call the Vaultdweller - is he still alive?
  237: He ancestor now. Live with spirits. Live in me.
  238: The Vaultdweller is my ancestor. He lives on in me.
  239: Yes... there's a resemblance - you've got the same fire, too. I was always
    afraid that he was nothing but a skeleton somewhere in the desert.
  240: Me want hear you story.
  241: I'd like to hear your story.
  242: Figures. (sigh) Well, I was pretty young when we met. There was a gang of raiders
    - The Khans - Who'd gotten hold of me. Things were looking pretty bad when, all
    of a sudden, this stranger shows up and rescues me. Your Vaultdweller.
  243: Vaultdweller have many adventures.
  244: The Vaultdweller had many such adventures.
  245: I used to envy 'em that. I wanted a life of adventure, but I stayed here and
    took over as mayor when my dad died. Been running this place and building NCR
    ever since. Guess it turned out to be a pretty big life after all.
  246: Elder be happy know you still alive. Sorry, but me need ask more.
  247: The Elder will be happy to know that you are still alive. I'm sorry but I need
    to know more.
  248: Was Shady Sands; Most folks call it NCR now. New California Republic - pretty
    impressive name, huh?
  249: Tell about NCR.
  250: Me ask about something else.
  251: Tell me about the NCR please.
  252: Let me ask you something else.
  253: Lord, I could talk about that forever and I just don't have the time. Here's
    a holodisk on the NCR. We make 'em to spread the good word.
  254: Uh, thanks.
  255: So, they finally got reasonable. I can bull the Congress into sending supplies
    and techs. You sure we can get into the vault?
  256: Me sure. Lowlifes there but me kick ass.
  257: Quite sure. There were some lowlifes there but I kicked their ass.
  258: I've always believed in fair pay for fair work. My assistant will square things
    up.
  259: Me find problem. You look disk. There spy at NCR.
  260: Me need know one more thing. What if me found vault 13?
  261: I'm afraid you have another problem. If you'll look at this holodisk you'll
    see that you have a spy in the NCR.
  262: Just one more thing. What if I told you that I found vault 13?
  263: Thanks.
  264: Damn, the only person who knew all this was Feargus! I'm not suggesting anything,
    but maybe Gunther should know about this.
  265: Me tell. Me go now.
  266: Me need know one more thing. What if me found vault 13?
  267: Just one more thing. What if I told you that I found vault 13?
  268: I'll talk to him. Bye.
  269: It's all business, huh? Fine. Five hundred, when it's done. I don't haggle,
    so take it or don't waste my time.
  270: Me take but me need ask questions
  271: Me not interested.
  272: I'll take it but I need some information.
  273: Not interested.
  274: I'm Tandi, president of the NCR. So you whupped my boy, Hoss, over at Dusty's?
    Maybe you're the right man at the right time. Interested in some work?
  275: I'm Tandi, president of the NCR. So you're the girl who whupped my boy Hoss?
    I should've had such a daughter! I've got a job you might want. Interested?
  276: Maybe. What job?
  277: I might be, what's the job?
  278: I'm Tandi, president of the New California Republic. Welcome to Shady Sands.
    I hear some pretty impressive things about you. No point in dancing. Got some
    business I want to discuss.
  279: Uh, ok.
  280: Fine, what can I do for you?
  281: You're back. So, you interested in a job or not?
  282: No.
  283: Ok.
  284: Back, are you stranger? So's the job done? Do we have access to the vault?
  285: Me working on it. Bye.

    can forget it.

    There's the door.

  312: Thanks.
  313: Boys, get this glob of brahmin spit out of my office! Time for you to head
    on out stranger.
  314: Done
  315: My dad and Seth searched for years trying to find Vault 13. They died looking
    - always said it was west of here. If somebody were to find Vault 13, that'd do
    us even better than 15.
  316: You'll have to talk to my aide, Gunther, about that.

  111: Shamble off
  112: What is this building?
  113: I'm looking for the Vault.
  114: I'm looking for a particular Servant...Joshua, I believe. Is he here?
  115: You looking to buy any slaves...er, servants?
  116: Nothing today, thanks.
  117: This? Why, this is the Servant Assignment Center. Were you in need of a servant?
  118: This is the Servant Assignment Center.
  119: Servant Assignment Center? What's that?
  120: I'm looking for a particular Servant...Joshua, I believe. Is he here?
  121: Servant Allocation, huh? Do you buy slaves...er, servants here?
  122: No, just curious. Thanks.
  123: Just curious. thanks.
  124: The Vault? It's that huge hole in the mountain on the east side of the city.
    Head out the front door, turn left and walk straight ahead. You can't miss it.
  125: What is this building?
  126: Can anyone get in there?
  127: I had another question for you.
  128: Thanks for the directions. Goodbye.
  129: What th-? Are you one of the new Servants?
  130: Yup
  131: Uh-uh me leave now
  132: You must be new around here. I'll explain it...slowly.
  133: Citizens who need help with menial tasks come here to have a Servant assigned
    to them for the day.
  134: That sounds a lot like slavery.
  135: Oh, so this is where the slaves are stored? Why didn't you say so?
  136: Where do you get all these servants?
  137: I am looking for a particular Servant...Joshua, I believe. Is he here?
  138: Are you looking to buy slaves...er, servants, right now?
  139: All right, just curious, thanks. Good day.
  140: |-
    I'm tired of Servants being sent over with no clearance... *sigh*... let's see, you said you were looking for the Vault?
     That must be your assignment for the day. Very well. I will have someone escort you there.
  141: Valt! Valt!
  142: |-
    I'd watch that kind of talk if I were you. It is NOT slavery. We take care of these refugees,
     and they have a good life...better than they would get in the wastes.
  143: Where do you get them?
  144: Oh, I had some other questions...
  145: That's all I needed to know then, thanks. Good day.
  146: No, you need to be a Citizen in order to be allowed into the Vault. Now, look,
    I happen to be very busy at the moment, so if you would please excuse me...
  147: Just one more question...
  148: All right. Goodbye.
  149: Our Servants are usually refugees from raider attacks or contractual prisoners
    who wish to work off their sentence in a productive manner.
  150: Oh, you mean scripters? I knew this guy named Dan once who...
  151: At the cost of their freedom, eh?
  152: Do you have a contractual prisoner named Joshua in custody?
  153: Are you looking to buy any slave...er, servants...right now?
  154: Hmmm. I had another question...
  155: I see. Thanks for the information.
  156: No, not scripters, you moron.
  157: Moron? I had to work hard to get the minimum 9 Intelligence and Perception
    to find this node.  Anyway, you were saying?
  158: You're a fine one to make moral judgments, slaver. Get out of here.
  159: You sound a lot like that idiot Moore...just what Vault City needs. Look, whoever
    you are, I have work to do, so if you'll kindly remove yourself...
  160: All right, all right...
  161: Why don't you make me leave?
  162: |-
    Joshua? Yes, we do have a Servant by that name, but you wouldn't want him assigned to you.
     Training him has been...difficult. I'm not certain he can be trained.
  163: Joshua? I think we once had a Servant by that name, but not anymore.
  164: |-
    I need to question him about a matter of Vault City security. Have him sent to the Courtyard
     at once.
  165: I would like him assigned to me anyway.
  166: Difficult?
  167: Oh, I don't want him assigned to me. Far from it. I am concerned that he might
    be infected.
  168: Hmmm. Another question then...
  169: All right. Goodbye.
  170: I don't think it's a good idea. Wait until he has undergone some more training
    first, then I'll consider it.
  171: You said he's been difficult?
  172: Just one more question...
  173: All right. Goodbye.
  174: |-
    Yes, he's more stubborn than almost any Servant we've ever had here. If I didn't know
     better, I'd assume his father was a brahmin.
  175: |-
    You know, that kind of attitude could prove to be a problem. What if the rest of the
     Servants start following his example?
  176: I could purchase him and take him off your hands. Does the Center take..."donations?"
  177: Just one more question...
  178: All right. Goodbye.
  179: That's true. I have had to separate him from some of the others...and just
    yesterday one of the Servants actually had the audacity to question one of my
    requests.
  180: You should release him now before it gets worse.
  181: Joshua? Yes, we do have a Servant by that name. He was recently transferred
    from the Corrections Center. Your interest in him is...?
  182: I'd like to negotiate for his release.
  183: I suspect he has a contagious disease. You might want to release him before
    he infects the other Servants.
  184: No reason. I did have some other questions...
  185: All right. Goodbye.
  186: Oh, really? And what makes you think I would release him?
  187: A sizeable donation to the Servant Allocation Center operating fund, perhaps?
  188: I suspect he has a contagious disease. You might want to release him before
    he infects the other Servants.
  189: No reason. I did have some other questions...
  190: All right. Goodbye.
  191: No, I was thinking of a more sizeable donation.
  192: Hmmn. Donations are indeed welcome to insure the smooth operation of the Center,
    but it would require a sizeable donation before I could release Joshua into your
    care.
  193: How about $1000?
  194: How about $750?
  195: How about $500?
  196: How about $250?
  197: I'll think about it. I did have some other questions...
  198: I see. I may return later.
  199: I see. I may return later when I have enough funds for a donation.
  200: |-
    Well...that's not as much of a donation as I would like, but it will do. I shall see to it that this Joshua you have
     requested is shipped to the Courtyard for processing. Let me make the necessary arrangements.
  201: Okay.
  202: |-
    It is done. Joshua is no longer a servant of Vault City, and he has been moved into the Courtyard with the rest
     of the Outworlders.
  203: Thanks. I had some other questions...
  204: Very well. I will go pick him up there, then.
  205: Sounds good. Hopefully, he won't make this way back into the city.
  206: Is that so? Are you aware that each Servant is thoroughly checked before being
    admitted into the Allocation Center?
  207: Maybe I was wrong. Nevertheless, I'd like to negotiate for his release.
  208: 'Are you aware of '
  209: "'s Syndrome? It doesn't show up on most medical scans, and its symptoms can
    lie dormant for weeks."
  210: 'In the wastes, there is a disease called '
  211: "'s Syndrome. Perhaps you've noticed the lowered energy level of your Servants
    recently? Their general surliness?"
  212: That is utter nonsense. Now if you are quite done with wasting my time with
    your lies...
  213: All right, forget "
  214: '''s Syndrome." I''d still like to negotiate for Joshua''s release.'
  215: Never mind, then. I had some other questions...
  216: I'm leaving, then. Goodbye.
  217: Infected? Infected with what?
  218: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms?
  219: Perhaps you've noticed the lowered energy level of your Servants recently?
    Short attention span? Their inability to hear orders and follow them correctly?
    Those are only the early stages.
  220: Uh...
  221: |-
    's Syndrome. A lot of Outworlders have it. Its symptoms include, uh, speaking when not being spoken to. And using
     coarse language.
  222: |-
    Hmmmm. It wouldn't do if Citizens began to report problems with the Servants...very well, I shall release Joshua at
     once. If you would give me a moment to make the arrangements...
  223: |-
    Yes...I have noticed those symptoms in the Servants of late. Contagious, you say? Hmmm. Well, if this Joshua is a
     carrier, I shall release him at once. Give me a moment to make the arrangements...
  224: No problem. Joshua would be better off with the Outworlders anyway.
  225: Of course, Captain. I will take care of it right now.
  226: Excellent. Thank you, Citizen.
  227: Perhaps. Do you have some you wish to sell?
  228: Yes, I have one right here with me. Take a look and make me an offer.
  229: Yes, I have a few right here with me. Take a look and make me an offer.
  230: No, actually. I had some questions for you...
  231: No, not today, actually. Goodbye.
  232: Hmmm. That woman there, Miria, is it? She has strong arms...and nice hips.
    I will buy her from you for $250.
  233: Hmmm. that boy there, Davin, is it? He look relatively free from Outworlder
    contamination. I will buy him from you for $250.
  234: Hmmm. That tribal you have. He smells...strongly. But he looks healthy. I'll
    take him for $100.
  235: Hmmm. That man there...Vic, is it? Even though he's old, he looks like a handyman.
    $100.
  236: |-
    Perhaps you should return when you have a servant of value to show me. Your current stock...
     is unimpressive.
  237: C'mon, the slave's worth more than that.
  238: That is a fair price. The servant's all yours.
  239: Actually, I'm not looking to sell that one just yet. I did have some questions
    I wanted to ask you...
  240: Actually, I'm not looking to sell that slave. Let's deal another time.
  241: Very well. I had some questions for you, though...
  242: All right. Some other time when I get better stock, then.
  243: No, I don't think so...250 or nothing.
  244: No, the boy looks like he would be difficult to train...200 or nothing.
  245: Look. It'll take a week to wash the smell off that tribal. 100 or nothing.
  246: You can't even promise me that he won't have a heat attack once he leaves you
    care. He's old. 100 or nothing.
  247: All right, that's fair. The servant's all yours.
  248: Forget it, then. I did have some questions I wanted to ask you...
  249: Nothing it is, then. I can't afford to let my servant go for that price. Maybe
    some other time.
  250: Hmmmm...She does look like a healthy specimen...maybe I could put her to work
    around here. $500. And that's my final offer.
  251: Hmmmm. He is a healthy specimen. $400 for him, then.
  252: Hmmmm. All right. $200, then. And no more haggling.
  253: Hmmmmmmm. $200. And not a dollar more.
  254: That's fair. The servant's all yours.
  255: Actually, I'm not looking to sell that one just yet. I did have some questions
    I wanted to ask you...
  256: Actually, I'm not looking to sell that slave. Let's deal another time.
  257: 'Excellent. Here is your money. I will have her shipped off for medical tests
    and processing. '
  258: 'Excellent. Here is your money. I will have him shipped off for medical tests
    and processing. '
  259: 'Excellent. Here is your money. I will have the tribal shipped off for medical
    tests and processing. '
  260: 'Excellent. Here is your money. I will have the old man shipped off for medical
    tests and processing. '
  261: Give me a moment to take care of the arrangements...
  262: Sure. I'll just wait here.
  263: |-
    Very well. Your Servant has been relocated for medical testing and re-conditioning.
     Curious...the Servant seemed quite surprised by the whole affair. It took a few tranquilizer
     darts to smooth things over. I put everything the Servant was carrying in the box in my office.
  264: Well, Servants will be Servants. I had some other questions I wanted to ask
    you...
  265: Really? Well, I 'm sure they'll be more docile as time goes on. Are you interested
    in any other companions?
  266: Yeah, they can be a little difficult at first; they'll get accustomed to it.
    Good day.
  267: What are you doing back here? I sent you to the Vault! Of all the... very well,
    I will have someone escort you back there.
  268: Oh-keeeee
  269: You convinced Barkus to release Joshua.
vcconnar:
  100: You see a dirty but strong-looking man.
  101: You see Connar.
  102: Hey you! What are you doing!
  103: Stay where you are for now, wanderer. What are you doing here?
  104: I'm killing off the monsters here.
  105: Why, what's it to you?
  106: Why you Yell!
  107: |-
    I bet those bastards at Vault City sent you. Well you best be off, and leave everything else
     alive.
  108: Well, it's a little late for that.
  109: Why?
  110: Sorry, I have a job to do.
  111: |-
    Those creatures are the only thing that are stopping Vault City from making us their so-called
     servants.
  112: Well they're paying me to get rid of the monsters, and that's what I'm going
    to do.
  113: They didn't tell me that.
  114: They're paying me to get rid of them, and the job's done.
  115: You idiot! Why the hell did you do that!
  116: I needed the money.
  117: They'll come for us if you do that, you know.
  118: Not my problem.
  119: Well I hope you choke on it. They'll be here for us soon.
  120: I didn't know this was why they wanted the job done.
  121: Yeah, well, I don't deal with trash like you anyway.
  122: Well, we can't let you do that.
  123: You gotta do what you gotta do.
  124: You believed them at face value?  You've a lot to learn about the world, friend.
  125: Is there anything I could do to help?
  126: |-
    The Vault City boys aren't the bravest. You show them any kind of a fight and they run for the
     hills. If we had a few guns, I think we could hold them off.
  127: What sort of guns?
  128: |-
    Well, I'm good with a shotgun, and we have some people in here that can handle a rifle. I think
     three of those would do.
  129: I'll see what I can do.
  130: You're not wanted here. Leave now.
  131: I changed my mind. What can I do to help?
  132: Yeah, well, you're not going to be here for long anyway.
  133: Like I care.
  134: You're back! Do you have the guns for us?
  135: What was it that you needed again?
  136: Yep, here they are.
  137: We need three rifles and a shotgun. The sooner you can get them to us, the
    better.
  138: Okay.
  139: |-
    With these, we'll be able to make something of this place over the next months. If you ever need
     a place to rest, you will always be welcome here.
  140: You're welcome.
  141: Welcome back. Things are going well. We're going to work on expanding the Village.
  142: Hello again! Things have been going well, as you can see. Look around if you
    have the time.
  143: We're still building. We're hoping to expand the walls again in the next month.
  144: Greetings! The village has expanded again as we have hoped. You are welcome
    as always.
  145: |-
    We have nothing to fear from Vault City any longer, and will be able to live here in peace.
     Thank you again, wanderer.
  146: Just don't kill anything out there, you simpleton.

    I could help you with?
  110: Good day... Citizen, is it? I'd heard we had gained a new member of the community.
    Is there anything I could help you with?

  133: I think you might have a part that could fix Gecko's power plant.
  134: I repaired Gecko's plant.
  135: I have an economic data disk here you might find interesting.
  136: I found a way to optimize the Gecko reactor.
  137: Here's the Gecko reactor disk. Can you optimize it?
  138: Nothing today, thanks.
  139: I am Senior Councilor McClure. And you are...?
  140: None of your business.
  141: ". Pleased to meet you."
  142: I really have to run. Maybe we can do introductions some other time.
  143: I expect that kind of rudeness from an Outworlder, not a Citizen. I am a member
    of the Vault City Council, and you will show me the proper respect, or I will
    have your Citizenship revoked. Do you understand me?
  144: Screw you, old man.
  145: Whatever. I'm done talking to you anyway.
  146: Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you.
  147: Well, this is the rudeness I've come to expect from Outworlders! Give me your
    Day Pass and go with the guards. There is no place for your kind in our city.
  148: I'm not giving you anything. You want it? You come get it.
  149: I'm NOT an Outworlder. I'm a Citizen.
  150: Okay, okay, I'm going.
  151: I find that hard to believe. Let me see your papers.
  152: Here, take them!
  153: You want them? You come get them.
  154: I don't know how someone of your inferior breeding became a Citizen but these
    papers seem to be in order. Strange... I don't recall seeing you around before.
    No matter, I shall honor your Citizenship.
  155: You're damn right you'll honor my Citizenship!
  156: Yeah, right. I'm outta here.
  157: Don't ever speak to me again. If you do, I will have your Citizenship revoked.
    Good day.
  158: Good day.
  159: You try and revoke my Citizenship, you'll regret it.
  160: Your powers are weak, old man. You are no match for me.
  161: That's it! Citizen or not, you're out of here. Guards, show this degenerate
    to the gates!
  162: I'm going. This place sucked anyway.
  163: I'm not going anywhere.
  164: What can I do for you?
  165: I don't know, old man. What CAN you do for me?
  166: I'm looking for a Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
  167: Can I ask you some questions?
  168: Nothing today. I was just taking a tour of the council building.
  169: A GECK? As I understand it, we only had one. I read that it lasted a long time
    but it broke down a number of years before I was even born. We were supposed to
    have two...
  170: Supposed to?
  171: "... but apparently the old government messed up the shipments and we received
    a shipment that was meant to go to a Vault number... thirteen, I think it was.
    They probably received our other GECK."
  172: What was in the shipment that was meant for Vault 13?
  173: What happened to the GECK that broke down?
  174: Can I ask you another question?
  175: I see. Thanks for the information.
  176: Water Chips, a hundred or so. I don't know why they sent so many... we have
    never needed to replace ours. We have had the same water chip since the day our
    people lived underground in the Vault.
  177: What happened to the GECK that broke down?
  178: Can I ask you another question?
  179: Interesting. Thanks for your time.
  180: The irony is razor sharp. Maybe we'll talk later after I stop the bleeding.
  181: It was disassembled, and its parts were used for other applications.
  182: What was in the shipment meant for Vault 13?
  183: Can I ask you another question?
  184: I see. Thanks for your time.
  185: She is the leader of the people. The Citizens of Vault City look to her for
    guidance, but the Citizens, through the Council, still have final say on matters.
    In these trying times, she is a pillar of our society.
  186: '"Trying times?" What do you mean?'
  187: What is it you do?
  188: Can I ask you another question?
  189: Thanks for you time. Goodbye.
  190: Gecko? What do you want to know?
  191: Where is Gecko?
  192: What is Gecko?
  193: Can I ask you another question?
  194: Thanks for you time. Goodbye.
  195: Not much to tell, other than the fact that our ore shipments have become few
    and far between.
  196: Any idea why?
  197: Where is Redding?
  198: Can I ask you another question?
  199: Thanks for you time. Goodbye.
  200: I am the Senior Council Member. I oversee the council meetings.
  201: Then what does the First Citizen do?
  202: Can I ask you another question?
  203: Thank you for you time. Goodbye.
  204: Well, Citizenship isn't for everyone, you understand. You seem more like an
    adventurer to me... I really don't think that Citizenship is for you.
  205: Aw, c'mon... just tell me what I need to do to become a Citizen.
  206: I'd still like to become a Citizen anyway.
  207: Can I ask you another question?
  208: Nevermind then.
  209: You wish to become a Citizen? Well, we would be pleased to have you. All you
    need to do is talk to Proconsul Gregory and he will give you the Citizenship test.
  210: Where can I find Proconsul Gregory?
  211: Can I ask you another question?
  212: Thanks. I'll go find him now. Goodbye.
  213: Very well. All you need do is talk to Proconsul Gregory and he will give you
    the Citizenship test.
  214: Where can I find Proconsul Gregory?
  215: Can I ask you another question?
  216: All right. I'll go speak to the Proconsul now.
  217: You'll find him in the East Wing. His office is across from the First Citizen's.
  218: Can I ask you another question?
  219: Thanks for you time. Goodbye.
  220: Things have been tough these last two years. The NCR has been getting more
    aggressive in their attempts to get Vault City to join the Republic.
  221: They tell us that if we were to join, they would be able to defend us from
    the raider attacks on our city. As of late, these raider attacks have become more
    brutal.
  222: On top of all of this, we have ghouls in Gecko contaminating our groundwater.
  223: Where is Gecko?
  224: What is Gecko?
  225: Trying times, indeed. Can I ask you another question?
  226: Sorry to hear it. Thanks for your time. Goodbye.
  227: It is just northeast of here, but if you are planning on going there, I would
    advise you to purchase some anti-radiation chems. If they are contaminating our
    water, it is likely their town itself is irradiated.
  228: What is Gecko?
  229: Can I ask you another question?
  230: Thanks for the warning. Goodbye.
  231: It is a forsaken place, a shantytown built around the remnants of an old atomic
    power plant.
  232: Where is Gecko located?
  233: Can I ask you another question?
  234: Thanks for you time. Goodbye.
  235: No. I don't understand it at all. We are willing to pay top dollar for their
    ore, but whenever we try to talk to them about it, they become evasive. If only
    I knew what was going on...
  236: I could go check it out for you.
  237: Where is Redding?
  238: Thanks for you time. Goodbye.
  239: You will? It is not in my power to pay you, but your aid will be much appreciated.
  240: Where is Redding?
  241: No problem. I'll check it out and return when I find out what's wrong.
  242: Redding is a week or so west of here. I've never been there. Never been outside
    Vault City, for that matter. As I understand it, Redding is supposed to be one
    of the more pleasant settlements in the wastes.
  243: Do you have any idea what's causing the shipments to drop off?
  244: I see. Thanks for the information.
  245: What is it? Anything you could tell me would be a great help.
  246: What can you tell me about Redding?
  247: I found that a large part of Redding is reliant on a chem called Jet. The miners
    are trading most of their ore to New Reno just to keep supplied.
  248: Dr. Troy has created an antidote for Jet.
  249: I delivered the antidote to Redding.
  250: What is this "Jet" that they are all reliant on?
  251: I'll tell you later when I find out more.
  252: It's a chem with a 100% reliance rate, and severe withdrawals.
  253: Please keep me posted.
  254: Can I ask you some other questions?
  255: Sure.
  256: This is sad news, we need to find a way to put a stop to this. If this keeps
    up, our ore supplies will dwindle to nothing. Please help us.
  257: I'll see what I can do.
  258: He has? Well then, what are you doing here? Take it to Doc Johnson in Redding!
    He should be able to find a way to administer it to the miners.
  259: I know, you already told me. Please take it to Redding and see if you can help
    them.
  260: Before I go, can I ask you some other questions?
  261: Okay, goodbye.
  262: Thank you! Now all we can do is wait. Hopefully, this fixes our problem. Thank
    you again for all of your assistance.
  263: You're welcome. I was glad to be of service.
  264: Not a problem. Could I ask you some other questions?
  265: Whoa... don't I get anything for my troubles?
  266: If it is money you want, money you will receive. Here's $500 for your troubles.
    Now good day.
  267: THANK you.
  268: Five hun --? You better cough up some more and fast, or your life won't be
    worth $2.
  269: What do you mean?
  270: If I had a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator, I could make their plant
    run clean.
  271: Oh, nothing. Sorry to trouble you.
  272: That's an acceptable solution. Stopping the radiation poisoning is all I care
    about.
  273: I'm worried that Lynette will withhold my Citizenship if I fix the plant.
  274: Great! Where can I get the part?
  275: I'll keep that in mind.
  276: If you fix their plant, I'll give you Citizenship, and there's not a damn thing
    she can do about it.
  277: Excellent! Where can I get the part?
  278: Go see Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer. He should have the part in stock.
  279: Thanks. I'll go see him right now.
  280: There's one other thing. You might find this economic data disk interesting.
  281: Excellent! I was worried that the radiation build-up might force us to relocate.
    You are to be commended on a job well done.
  282: Vault City prevails, Citizen.
  283: Vault City, prevails, Captain.
  284: Here's your Citizenship papers. If you ever need anything, come see me.
  285: Vault City prevails, Councilor.
  286: Thanks.
  287: Yes, you mentioned that.
  288: Well done, Captain.
  289: Well done, Citizen.
  290: Well done.
  291: I had some other questions...
  292: Thanks.
  293: I'm sorry... an economic data disk? What do you mean?
  294: Here, take a look.
  295: It's an economic data disk that shows the amount of energy that Gecko's atomic
    power plant produced before the war... and could produce again.
  296: Never mind. I had some other questions.
  297: Nothing. Sorry to disturb you.
  298: Very well. Give me a moment...
  299: All right.
  300: Hmmm. How did you come by this disk?
  301: I... found it.
  302: I found it while searching some of the archives in the Vault City library.
  303: I got it from someone in Gecko.
  304: I received it from a ghoul in Gecko. His name is Gordon Gecko. He's interested
    in optimizing the power plant and sharing the energy with Vault City... in exchange
    for Vault City's medical technology.
  305: I... see. So. What does this have to do with me?
  306: Well, as I understand it, Vault City's power generator can only support so
    many people. In fact, it's already nearing its limit.
  307: I'm not going to ask you how you came by that information, but if it were true,
    what are you proposing?
  308: Once the Gecko power plant is fixed, the disk indicates it's possible it could
    produce enough energy for Vault City, too. It looks like the reactor would need
    to be optimized first, though.
  309: The disk shows that Gecko's power plant... if it were optimized... could produce
    a great deal of energy. Far more than Gecko needs. Vault City could use that energy.
  310: Are you suggesting we SEIZE Gecko and take their power plant? I will NOT lis
    --
  311: No, no... if Gecko could receive the optimization data for their plant, I'm
    betting they would be willing to trade their excess power for medical assistance.
  312: Hmmm. As far as medical assistance goes, I'm not unsympathetic to the plight
    of the ghouls. They have certainly suffered enough... but how could we optimize
    their plant?
  313: I don't know. Maybe there's someone I can talk to once the plant is repaired.
  314: I don't know. Maybe there's someone I can talk to at the plant.
  315: I would just need access to the Vault City computer. It could optimize the
    power plant reactor disk and allow the plant to run more smoothly.
  316: I have no objections to your proposal. If you can find some means of optimizing
    the plant, let me know.
  317: All right. I'll go get that part from Randal and see about repairing the reactor
    first.
  318: Very well, Captain.
  319: Very well, Citizen.
  320: You have my permission to use the Vault computer and optimize the reactor disk.
    You can find it on the third level of the Vault, near the Operations Room.
  321: Excellent. Thank you, Councilor. I'll go do that.
  322: It is done. Here you go.
  323: I'll keep the economic disk and study it some more... Perhaps I can persuade
    the Council to enter negotiations with Gecko to trade for their power. The data
    disk would be a strong argument in of itself.
  324: I appreciate it. Thanks.
  325: Hmmm. Well, I cannot allow you access to the Vault, but I could optimize the
    reactor disk for you.
  326: All right. But I don't have the reactor disk on me. I'll be back with it.
  327: That'd be great.
  328: Excellent!
  329: All right.
  330: Let me take the reactor disk, and I'll have the Vault central computer optimize
    it.
  331: Great. Thanks.
  332: What is it?
  333: I have a reactor data disk here from Gecko. According to... the... uh, technician
    at the power plant, the Vault City computer can optimize the reactor disk and
    make the plant run more smoothly.
  334: Guards! Guards!
  335: "[]"
  336: You told McClure about the Redding Jet reliance problem.
  337: You gave the economic data disk to McClure.
  338: I'm still looking for a way to optimize the power plant.
  339: I'm still looking for a way to optimize the power plant.
  340: |-
    I wish I could help, but I'm afraid my knowledge of reactors is... limited. Perhaps one
     of the technicians at the Gecko plant would know how to optimize the plant?
  341: Perhaps. I had some other questions...
  342: Maybe so. I'll go see.
  343: You told McClure about the Jet antidote delivery.
vcnancy:
  100: You see the Resident Medical Assistant, Phyllis.
  101: You see a thin young woman. She smells faintly of antiseptic.
  102: You see RMA Phyllis.
  103: You see a thin young woman. She smells faintly of antiseptic.
  104: You risked your own life to save us ALL. You're the bravest person I've ever
    known.
  105: An intruder! Aieeeeee! Guards!
  106: A mutant! Aieeeeee! Guards!
  107: A ghoul! Aieeeeee! Guards!
  108: Need to print out Gregory's charts...
  109: Let's see. We have three Servant inoculations scheduled for 1400...
  110: All that beeping is driving me crazy...
  111: I swear those medical databases are talking amongst themselves...
  112: Let's see... three hypodermics, antiseptic, three ampules of RadX...
  113: Better prep Dr. Troy on that seminar for tomorrow...
  114: Yeah, they have me working late AGAIN. Mostly making lists.
  115: You might want to come back in the morning.
  116: I think I put you on the list for tomorrow morning, if it's an emergency.
  117: Can't wait to go home. Making all these lists wears me out.
  118: It'd be best if you came back in the morning. I have to compile these lists.
  119: Poor Dr. Troy. He didn't DO anything!
  120: Why did they exile Dr. Troy?
  121: I hope Dr. Troy will be all right in the Outworld...
  122: Hmmph. I'm too busy to speak to you right now. If you need anything, see Dr.
    Troy.
  123: Oh! Hello, there. I haven't seen you around before... are you a new Citizen?
  124: Oh! Hello, again.
  125: Sit-Zen?
  126: A-gin?
  127: Got ouchie... *snfff*... ouchie HURT
  128: Actually, I'm the new Captain of the Guard.
  129: Yeah, I just recently got my Citizenship.
  130: Uh, yeah, I just recently got my Citizenship.
  131: Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Good day.
  132: Oh my, you are hurt, aren't you? I'm sorry, I should have been paying more
    attention. Go see Dr. Troy. He'll take care of you.
  133: Uh...kay? Yup-yup.
  134: Could I ask you some questions first?
  135: Thanks. I'll go see him now.
  136: Oh! You must be one of the Servants assigned here for the day. You should...
    uh, hmmm. YOU - GO - MARTIN.
  137: 'Uh... hmmm. Listen to me again, closely this time: YOU - GO - MARTIN.'
  138: HUGO MARTIN.
  139: Got ouchie... *snfff*... ouchie HURT
  140: Shamble off
  141: YES, MARTIN. GO - BOTTOM - LEVEL.
  142: YES, MAR-TIN. GO BOTTOM LEVEL.
  143: Got ouchie... *snfff*... ouchie HURT
  144: Shamble off
  145: GO - BOTTOM - LEVEL. LEVEL - THREE. NOW.
  146: ME GO BOTTOM LEVEL TREE NOW
  147: Got ouchie... *snfff*... ouchie HURT
  148: Shamble off
  149: Maybe our Servants have some sort of Intelligence Deficiency Syndrome...
  150: Oh! Well, welcome to Vault City, Captain.
  151: Well, welcome to Vault City, fellow Citizen.
  152: We don't see many new faces around here. I'm Phyllis. What's your name?
  153: 'My name''s '
  154: 'I''m '
  155: If I wanted to give you my name, I would have told it to you, "Sy-phyllis"...
    or whatever the hell your name is.
  156: Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now.
  157: Why, of all the...! I have NEVER met someone as low-class as yourself. I suggest
    you leave. Now.
  158: I suggest you watch that tone of yours, or there's going to be trouble.
  159: Whatever. I'm done talking to you anyway.
  160: Guards! Dr. Troy! Help!
  161: So that's how it's going to be, huh? All right then...
  162: I'm the Resident Medical Assistant. I work for Dr. Troy.
  163: What do you think of Dr. Troy?
  164: Can I ask you some questions?
  165: Great. I could use some medical assistance.
  166: Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now.
  167: Welcome back. Anything I can help you with?
  168: Of course. What is it you would like to know?
  169: What do you think of Dr. Troy?
  170: Can you tell me where the Central Computer is?
  171: I need some healing.
  172: What do you do here?
  173: Can you tell me about Vault City?
  174: Actually, never mind. Thanks anyway.
  175: Oh, Dr. Troy can be pretty strict sometimes, but all in all, he's a good man.
    Vault City's fortunate to have him.
  176: Well, he asked me to smuggle some chems into the city for him.
  177: Can I ask you another question?
  178: Thanks for your time. Goodbye.
  179: "[]"
  180: "[]"
  181: Are you certain? That doesn't sound like Dr. Troy at all. Still... he HAS been
    working hard lately... no, no, that's impossible. You must be mistaken.
  182: I don't think so. He was very clear about what he wanted.
  183: Hmmmm. Can I ask you another question?
  184: Never mind then.
  185: I would be VERY careful about what you say about Dr. Troy in Vault City. He
    is a respected member of our community.
  186: All right, then. Can I ask you another question?
  187: Thanks for the warning. Maybe I should go talk to someone else.
  188: It's down on the 3rd level, if I remember correctly. Haven't been down there
    in ages.
  189: Why not?
  190: Can I ask you another question?
  191: Thanks for the directions. Goodbye.
  192: Oh, I don't know. Not much reason to go down into the Vault. It's mostly used
    for storage space nowadays. The only one down there is Martin, and... well, just
    between you and me, he's not a great conversationalist.
  193: Uhh.... Why did they make him conversationalist if he's no good at his job?
  194: Can I ask you another question?
  195: I see. Thanks for the information.
  196: Uh... maybe you SHOULD go speak to him. You two may have more in common than
    I first thought.
  197: Can I ask you another question first?
  198: All right then. I'll go speak to him.
  199: Vault City? Well, actually, there's not much to say. I mean, I've been a Citizen
    all my life... but there's not much to do in Vault City. At all.
  200: It seems a shame that a beautiful young woman such as yourself can't find SOMETHING
    to do in Vault City.
  201: Nothing at all? Come on.
  202: Can I ask you another question...
  203: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  204: Look, I know you're a new Citizen and all, and I don't mean to throw a damper
    on your Citizenship, but this City can be VERY dull at times.
  205: Dull? How so?
  206: That's too bad. I had some other questions...
  207: Oh, well. Sorry to hear it.
  208: I mean, have you noticed how similar everyone is? And OLD? Most of the seminars
    and extracurricular activities are geared towards octogenarians. I'm barely twenty-five,
    and this city makes me feel like I'm fifty.
  209: Uh... octo-generians? You mean the guards?
  210: Speaking of old, I noticed there aren't any children in the city.
  211: I DID notice the similarity of Citizens.
  212: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  213: 'Uh no… "octogenerian" is an adjective that refers to a person who is eighty
    years old. '
  214: Uh, okay. Can I ask you another question?
  215: All right then. Maybe we'll speak later.
  216: Well... yes. Actually, there aren't. Yet. I don't know if anyone told you yet,
    Vault City is a planned community. We're not due for another pregnancy cycle until
    a few years from now.
  217: Uh... a pregnancy cycle?
  218: Can I ask you another question?
  219: I see. Well, thanks for the information.
  220: Yes. Pregnancies are permitted only during certain years established by the
    Council.
  221: What if you get pregnant anyway?
  222: Oh. I had some other questions...
  223: I see. Well, thanks for the information.
  224: How would that happen?
  225: Uh, last I heard, SEX can make someone pregnant.
  226: Forget I asked. Look, I had some other questions...
  227: Never mind. I better be going.
  228: Oh, you mean intercourse? Intercourse is still allowed outside of pregnancy
    cycles.
  229: Doesn't that make people pregnant?
  230: Oh. I had some other questions...
  231: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  232: Oh, no, no... you see, our pregnancies don't result from intercourse.
  233: I'm afraid to ask. But I will anyway.
  234: I don't want to know any more. I had some other questions, though...
  235: I think I've heard enough.
  236: Male Citizens "donate" to the Auto-Doc here in the Vault and the most favorable
    matches are chosen by the computer. Then the appropriate female Citizen is seeded
    by the Auto-Doc.
  237: Can I donate?
  238: Don't people still get pregnant from intercourse? What about accidental pregnancies?
  239: You know, I would very much like to ask you any other question right now.
  240: Would you excuse me? I'm going to go see if I can get my Citizenship revoked.
  241: I think I'm going to go somewhere and be violently ill. Goodbye.
  242: Certainly. We'd welcome your contribution. Vault City could use some fresh
    genetic material.
  243: All right then...
  244: Say, could I get a magazine or something?
  245: Your contribution is impressive... you yourself seem to be quite gifted. How
    do you feel?
  246: Excellent! Thank you.
  247: Hmmm. Maybe your contribution wasn't as valuable as I thought. Thanks anyway,
    though.
  248: I can honestly say I have never missed the primitive charm of Arroyo more until
    this moment.
  249: I have never felt the need to be held more than at this moment.
  250: No, thank YOU.
  251: Well, actually... you see, this is something I've been thinking about recently,
    but Citizens don't seem to have accidental pregnancies. The only successful pregnancies
    have been facilitated by the Auto-Doc.
  252: You know, background radiation might be resulting in sterility or even worse,
    chromosomal damage. Might be worth checking out.
  253: Maybe it's just because they don't have much real sex around here.
  254: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  255: You know, I was thinking the same thing. Maybe I should mention it to Dr. Troy.
    He's been too busy to look into it recently, but the next pregnancy cycle IS coming
    up, so...
  256: Can I ask you some other questions?
  257: Mentioning it to Dr. Troy would be a good idea. Good luck.
  258: It's like they're all... clones. They all dress alike, act alike, and the worst
    part is that everybody seems happy with it. I... well, sometimes I worry that
    I'll end up being just like them. That probably sounds silly, huh?
  259: Not at all. Pressure to conform must be pretty rough around here, especially
    considering how insular a community Vault City is.
  260: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  261: Yeah, it can get kind of overwhelming at times. But here I am, bringing down
    your opinion of Vault City. Don't misunderstand me. It's a great place to live.
  262: Just a suggestion, but you might want to travel a little outside of Vault City.
    Even speak to some of the merchants in the Courtyard. They might be able to broaden
    your horizons a little.
  263: It's got its advantages, no doubt. Can I ask you some other questions?
  264: Glad you're happy here. Maybe we'll speak again.
  265: Well, I've been tempted to go outside the gate, but the other Citizens have
    warned me against it...
  266: That's just another reason to do it. You don't want to do what the OTHER Citizens
    do, do you? They're all set in their ways.
  267: Well, it can be dangerous out there. Say, can I ask you another question?
  268: They're right. It's probably not a good idea. I better be going.
  269: You know, you're right. Maybe I will step outside the gate when I get the chance.
    I'd like to know more about the outside world.
  270: Great. Say, can I ask you another question?
  271: It'll be good for you. Take care.
  272: Pardon me?
  273: I couldn't help but notice you're an attractive young woman who could stand
    to get out once in a while. How about you and I have dinner?
  274: Never mind. Can I ask you another question?
  275: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  276: Oh. I... you know, I'd love to, but I can't.
  277: Oh. Well, I... I'd love to.
  278: Aw, c'mon. I'm new. I'll get into trouble if I go around by myself.
  279: All right. Can I ask you some questions then?
  280: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  281: Great! Let's go.
  282: Thanks for the wonderful evening.
  283: Uh... sure. Maybe we'll go out some other time. I'll... uh, call you. Bye.
  284: I'm sorry, but no.
  285: All right. Can I ask you some questions instead?
  286: Oh, well. Just thought I'd ask.
  287: Well, it's good to see same-sex prejudice is alive and well in Vault City.
    Bye.
  288: ". What do you do around here?"
  289: ". Mind if I ask you some questions?"
  290: Oh well, I thought there weren't any children because this might be the European
    version of Fallout 2. Goodbye.
  291: You have given Vault City a donation and introduced favorable genetic material
    into their community.
  292: You have given Vault City a donation and introduced fresh genetic material
    into their community.
  293: You have given Vault City a donation... for whatever it's worth.
  294: You have convinced Phyllis to speak to Dr. Troy about the potential sterility
    in Vault City.
  295: You have convinced Phyllis to see the outside world.
  296: You quickly discover Phyllis is rather dull and self-centered. You resolve
    never to date anyone like her again.
  297: Speaking of octo-generic- uh, octo-ians, uh, old people, I noticed there aren't
    any children in Vault city.
vcoldjoe:
  100: You see an old man with a crazy gleam in his eye.
  101: You see Old Joe, the local idiot savant.
  102: Hello. Haven't seen you in a while.
  103: Do I know you?
  104: Ah, yeah. It's been a while. What have you been doing?
  105: Well, it has been a while. What have you been up to?
  106: This and that. Where do you know me from?
  107: Look, old man, I don't know who the hell you are.
  108: |-
    Sure has. Well, I've been around; finally ended up here in this god-forsaken place. Not like the
     good old days. No sir.
  109: Yeah, the good old days. Remember that time we...
  110: It hasn't been the same lately, that's for sure. Now... what did we do together?
  111: Don't remember me, do you? Well, you do seem to be a bit young.
  112: What are you trying to tell me?
  113: You look so familiar, though. Ah, must be my old eyes. Well, good day to you.
  114: Uh, yeah... goodbye.
  115: |-
    Yeah, we sure gave the Master hell, didn't we? Shit fell apart after you left, though. Had to
     move around and change my name. Where'd you end up?
  116: I've been living up in a small village.
  117: |-
    Well, you better be careful around here. Things ain't as clear as they once were. You best watch
     your back.
  118: Okay, thanks.
  119: |-
    Yeah, I looked for your Vault for a while, but never found it. So you got any good stories for
     your old friend Ian?
  120: Ian?
  121: |-
    Yeah, Ian. Don't you remember me? It's been a bunch of years. You'd think someone wouldn't
     forget his best buddy. Well... except for the shooting in the back thing. Sorry about that again.
  122: |-
    I am sorry, but you must think I am the Vault Dweller. My village was founded by the one who
     came from the Vault.
  123: "Well, that makes a bit more sense. Well, it's good to hear my friend did well.
    Well, old Ian's\n got some advice for you. You be careful out there. This place
    ain't as peachy as it seems. "
  124: What's going on here?
  125: |-
    Well, the Vault Citizens think very highly of their bloodline and don't care much for
     people like me and you. You take this gun. It'll protect you if things get a little out of control.
     You probably shouldn't be seen talking with this crazy old man. Best get on your way.
  126: Thanks for your help.
  127: Let an old man rest.
  128: So familiar...
  129: Leave me be now.
  130: You better get going.
  131: They'll get suspicious if we talk anymore.
  132: Go on, get. Make my old friend proud.
vcrandal:
  100: You see Randal, the Chief Amenities Offcier.
  101: You see a middle-aged man with thinning black hair.
  102: You see Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer.
  103: You see a middle-aged man with thinning black hair.
  104: 'Congratulations, '
  105: Way to put those Enclave assh-... er, jerks, in their place!
  106: I heard you kicked some major tail down south. Way to go.
  107: An intruder! Guards! Guards!
  108: Wh-?! A mutant! Guards!
  109: Wh-? A ghoul! Guards!
  110: Good day, Captain.
  111: Vault City prevails, Captain.
  112: Good day, Citizen.
  113: Vault City prevails, Citizen.
  114: Need to send distribution charts to Sub-Amenities Offices A and B...
  115: Need to compile the latest stock inventories and put them on the list server...
  116: I miss DOS. This new operating system makes it harder to enter lists.
  117: The First Citizen still needs those inventory lists...
  118: Sorry, we're closed for the evening. Come back in the morning.
  119: We're closed. I'm just compiling these lists before I head home.
  120: Hello there, stranger. Always a pleasure to see a new face. Name's Randal...I'm
    the Chief Amenities Officer. Need something?
  121: Gechkk
  122: Nooooooooo-pe
  123: Shamble off
  124: Well, it depends. What is this place?
  125: Nothing today, actually.
  126: A GECK? That's a Garden of Eden Creation Kit, a kind of gray suitcase looking
    thing, right? I haven't heard anyone mention one of those in... well, since...
    almost forever.
  127: NEED Gechkkk
  128: Shamble off
  129: Do you have one?
  130: Mind if I ask you something else?
  131: Well, never mind then.
  132: Hate to break it to you, friend, but we don't have ours anymore. Used it up
    to make Vault City...*poof.* All gone.
  133: NEED Gechkkk.
  134: Shamble off
  135: Oh...well, do you know of any place that might have one?
  136: Mind if I ask you something else?
  137: Well, nevermind then.
  138: 'Well, hmmm. Here''s your problem, as I see it: the GECK''s an old piece of
    tech... pre-war tech, in fact. You just can''t "find" them anymore. They were
    only issued to Vaults.'
  139: NEED Valt.
  140: Shamble off
  141: Do you know where I could find any other Vaults?
  142: Mind if I ask you something else?
  143: Well, never mind then.
  144: You could go scan the Vault Central Computer, see if it has any coordinates
    for any other Vaults. I doubt it, but no harm in checking.
  145: Well, if you had access to our Vault Central Computer, you might be able to
    find some mention of some other Vaults. But only Citizens are allowed in the Vault.
  146: Tanks
  147: Mind if I ask you something else?
  148: Thanks for the information.
  149: Hey there, welcome back. Anything I can do for you?
  150: Sure. What's on your mind?
  151: Gechkk?
  152: Shamble off
  153: What is this place again?
  154: Do you happen to have a GECK in stock?
  155: Valerie over at the maintenance shed could use a new wrench and some pliers.
  156: Councillor McClure said you'd have a... uh, hydro-magneto-thingie that I could
    have for the Gecko power plant.
  157: Councillor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator
    in stock that I could have.
  158: The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.
  159: Nothing today, actually.
  160: This is the Amenities Office. Got your typical stock... basic living necessities,
    some books, "how to" manuals, some tools, stimpacks, medical supplies, this and
    that.
  161: Sounds great. Can I see what you have in stock?
  162: Do you have a GECK?
  163: Valerie over at the maintenance shed could use a new wrench and some pliers.
  164: Councillor McClure said you'd have a... uh, hydro-magneto-thingie that I could
    have for the Gecko power plant.
  165: Councillor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator
    in stock that I could have.
  166: The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.
  167: Mind if I ask you some other questions?
  168: I may be back some other time.
  169: Well, sorry to break it to you, but I'm only authorized to do transactions
    with Citizens. No offense to you, but it's the rule, you know? You might try Happy
    Harry's out in the Courtyard.
  170: Well, sorry to break it to you, but I'm only authorized to do transactions
    with Citizens. No offense to you, but it's the rule, you know? You might try Happy
    Harry's out in the Courtyard.
  171: How can I become a Citizen?
  172: But... uh, I am a Citizen. Don't you remember me?
  173: Look, my money's just as good as any Citizen's.
  174: Councillor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magentosphere regulator
    in stock that I could have.
  175: The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.
  176: Mind if I ask you some other questions?
  177: Fine. Goodbye.
  178: You can take the Citizenship test. Proconsul Gregory gives it to any Outsider
    who wants to become a Citizen. You should probably talk to First Citizen Lynette
    first, though. She kind of runs the show around here.
  179: All right. Where is she?
  180: I see. Mind if I ask you another question?
  181: Thanks for the information. I'll go look for her.
  182: She's in the Council Building... head out the building here, make a right,
    and keep heading down the street past the park. You should run right smack into
    it.
  183: I see. Mind if I ask you another question?
  184: Thanks for the information. I'll go look for her.
  185: Really? Can't say I recall you. You got any papers on you? Might clear up the
    matter.
  186: No, I don't have them on me right now.
  187: Yes. Here you go.
  188: Never mind. I'll talk to you later.
  189: Well, let me run it through the reader here, and we'll just make sure everything's
    on the up and up. Won't take but a moment.
  190: Wh-?! Whoa! Give those papers back!
  191: Uh... actually, I don't have time to buy anything right now. Let me have the
    papers back, and I'll be on my way.
  192: All right. I'm sure everything's in order.
  193: Well... uh, all right.
  194: Mind if I ask you some questions?
  195: I'll see you later.
  196: Everything checks out. Here's your papers back. What can I do for you?
  197: Let me see what you have in stock.
  198: Actually, do you mind if I ask you some questions instead?
  199: Nothing today, actually.
  200: 'So... you''re Citizen '
  201: 'Yeah, he said you''d be stopping by... '
  202: All right.
  203: Actually, never mind, I'll come back later for it.
  204: Okay, here you go. One Hy-Mag. Kinda looks like a lava lamp, doesn't it? Oh,
    don't drop it... it's pretty fragile.
  205: Say, what else do you have in stock?
  206: Mind if I ask you some questions?
  207: Thanks. I might stare at this for a few hours before taking it to the Gecko
    plant.
  208: Got it. Thanks for the part.
  209: Yeah, the First Citizen said you'd be stopping by... Captain. (Winks.) Let
    me tell you, Captain, you've got a BEAUTY waiting for you.
  210: Yeah, the First Citizen said you'd be stopping by. Well, let me tell you, friend,
    you got a BEAUTY waiting for you.
  211: What is it?
  212: Actually, keep it for me. I'll pick it up later.
  213: Nothing less than a Heckler and Koch G11, one of the best assault weapons ever
    made...(hefts weapon, passes it to you)...fires a 4.7 mm caseless cartridge, 50-round
    magazine. When it talks, people listen.
  214: I'll bet. Thanks.
  215: No problem. Plus, here... have a couple of frag grenades on me. Consider it
    my thanks for wiping out those raiders.
  216: Great. Can I see what else you have in stock?
  217: Can I ask you some other questions?
  218: Thanks. I'll put them to good use.
  219: That'll do it for you, then?
  220: Mind if I ask you some other questions?
  221: Yeah, that'll be it for today.
  222: Yeah, I know. I'm still waiting for the requisition lists to clear the server,
    but it's going to be a while. Don't know what to say. Things just take time.
  223: I see. Mind if I ask you some other questions?
  224: Maybe I can go find those tools somewhere else, then.
  225: "!"
  226: ", huh? Wait one minute, and I'll go get you the Hydroelectric Magneto...uh,
    the Hy-Mag."
  227: ", right? Wait one minute, and I'll go get you the Hydroelectric Magneto...uh,
    the Hy-Mag."
  228: Thanks.
  229: "[continue]"
vcskeeve:
  100: You see Wallace's Assistant, Skeev.
  101: You see a scrawny young man. His eyes are darting back and forth.
  102: You see Wallace's Assistant, Skeev.
  103: You see a scrawny young man. His eyes are darting back and forth.
  104: Hey, you got any pieces of Horrigan? I could sell 'em for fifty, hundred bucks
    a pop, give you 10% of the action.
  105: Get lost.
  106: Beat it. I got nothing to say to you.
  107: Oh, uh, hey, Captain. Good day, huh?
  108: Well, if it ain't the new Citizen.
  109: Hey there, "Citizen."
  110: You can't bring that mutant in here.
  111: You can't bring that ghoul in here.
  112: We're shut down for the night. Come back in the morning.
  113: Look, Outsider, if you got customs business, Wallace is in the back there,
    okay? He'll set you up with all the forms you need.
  114: Furms need?
  115: Shamble off
  116: Uh... what is this place?
  117: All right. Thanks.
  118: This is the CUSTOMS Office. Like the sign outside says. If you haven't got
    customs business, what are you doing here?
  119: I was looking for the Vault.
  120: I was looking to get inside the city.
  121: Since you're a part of customs and all, I was wondering if you had any 'advice'
    on how to bring certain items within the city.
  122: Nothing. Sorry to bother you.
  123: The Vault? It's inside the city. Why? You looking to get past the gate?
  124: Yes.
  125: No, just looking around. Thanks.
  126: Well, you could go see my boss, Wallace, and TRY to get permission to get inside,
    but you'd be wasting your time. He never lets anybody in. Of course, there's other
    ways...
  127: What other ways?
  128: Thanks. I'll go see Wallace then.
  129: Advice? Well, advice's expensive, Outsider. You got any money?
  130: Give him $50.
  131: Give him $75.
  132: Give him $100.
  133: Probably not enough to interest you. I'll be back when I have some more.
  134: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk later.
  135: Well, there's a few things you can do. One is become a Citizen. They never
    search Citizens. Of course, your chances of becoming a Citizen are next to nothing.
  136: Why?
  137: What else could I do?
  138: Nevermind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  139: If you're not born a Citizen, then you have to take a test to become a Citizen.
    Number of Outsiders that have taken the test and become Citizens? Zero. Your chances?
    LESS than zero.
  140: What is this test?
  141: What else could I do to beat customs?
  142: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  143: |-
    Gregory, the Proconsul, gives a "test" to any Outsiders who want to become Citizens. It measures their intelligence and
     perception, and you have to be damn lucky to pass it, too. Most Citizens would have trouble with it.
  144: So what makes it so hard?
  145: What else could I do to beat customs other than becoming a Citizen?
  146: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  147: Since most Outsiders can't read, do trigonometry, or spell "Australopithecus,"
    you figure it out. It's just an excuse to keep Outsiders from becoming Citizens.
  148: What else could I do to beat customs other than becoming a Citizen?
  149: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  150: |-
    Hide the goods on your slaves...your "Servants." You see, Vault City mentality is this:
    They don't seem to catch on that anyone would let Servants carry anything important... or questionable. Go figure.
  151: Any other options?
  152: All right, then. Thanks.
  153: Well, you CAN become a Citizen... unofficially.
  154: What are you talking about?
  155: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  156: If you got the cash, then I'll go into detail. Otherwise...
  157: I've got the money. What are you selling?
  158: Nevermind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  159: "$200, and the papers are yours."
  160: |-
    For two hundred bucks, I can make you a full-fledged Citizen. You'll have free passage through
     the gate, no hassles. I can print out the papers, register your serial number, and have you on your way
     in five minutes.
  161: What if I told somebody that you were peddling Citizenship papers?
  162: Sounds good. Here's $200.
  163: Well, two hundred's pretty steep. I only got $150 on me.
  164: I don't have that kind of cash on me. Maybe some other time.
  165: No thanks. Maybe some other time.
  166: Simple. They wouldn't BELIEVE you. You're an Outsider, I'm a Citizen. Guess
    whose word they're going to believe?
  167: I'll take the Citizenship papers, then.
  168: I'll take the Citizenship papers... but for $150, not $200.
  169: Well, $200's too steep for me. I might be back if I get some more money.
  170: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  171: |-
    Hmmm. Well, all right... I'm feeling charitable today. But don't tell any of your other Outsider
     friends you got them so cheap.
  172: All right.
  173: Just give me the damn papers.
  174: |-
    All right, they're all done printing. Here you are..."Citizen." And don't tell anyone about this,
     ESPECIALLY Wallace, all right?
  175: |-
    No problem. I would never think of doing such a thing to an upstanding Citizen such as
     yourself, especially when I have proof of your illegal activities sitting right here in my pocket.
  176: Got it. No problem.
  177: What th-?! Nobody's gonna believe you, Outsider! It'll be your word over mine!
  178: |-
    Normally, it would be. But these fake papers speak for themselves. And they will,
     unless you can pay for their silence.
  179: Of course it will. See you.
  180: I... wh... you dirty...
  181: Careful... I'd watch your tongue if I were you.
  182: Sweet talking me isn't going to help, Skeev.
  183: |-
    All right, I got a LITTLE cash stashed away. Here. Take it... three hundred bucks.
     Now, you gonna keep quiet?
  184: As far as you know. See you.
  185: No problem. You have my silence.
  186: Two hundred or nothing, Outsider. It's the only way you're going to get inside
    the gate.
  187: I think I'll try official channels.
  188: No thanks.
  189: |-
    Ha! Good luck, Outsider. The only way you'll get a Day Pass outta ol' man Wallace is if you pry
     it from his stingy, dead fingers.
  190: I'll try him anyway.
  191: If that's what it takes...
  192: You reconsider?
  193: You again. What do you want?
  194: Vant? Vant!
  195: Shamble off
  196: What is this place?
  197: I'd like to get inside the city.
  198: I'd like to buy those fake Citizenship papers you were offering before.
  199: I've decided to turn you in for selling fake Citizenship papers.
  200: Since you're a part of customs and all, I was wondering if you had any 'advice'
    on how to bring certain items within the city.
  201: Never mind.
  202: Look, dim, get out of here, or I'll call the guards.
  203: Look, dim, get out of h -- Mmmm. Wait a minute. Maybe...
  204: Hurnh?
  205: Shamble off
  206: Come with me a second, dim. I got somebody you gotta meet.
  207: Okee-dokeee
  208: Nuh-uh ME STAY
  209: Found this Outsider wandering in the wastes, Barkus. Looks like good Servant
    material.
  210: Found this bunch wandering in the wastes, Barkus. This one Outsider here looks
    like good Servant material.
  211: 2 Seconds
  212: You HAVE to be kidding. It's obviously retarded.
  213: 1 Second, don't remove Barkus' float yet.
  214: Re-tar-dead! Pooooo!
  215: 2 Seconds
  216: C'mon. You need someone to work the Vault, don't you?
  217: 1 Second, don't remove Barkus' float yet.
  218: Valt! Gechkk!
  219: 2 Seconds
  220: Well...hmmm. I suppose you'll be expecting a finder's fee?
  221: 2 Seconds
  222: Do Outsiders eat their own feces? Of COURSE I want a finder's fee.
  223: 1 Second, Don't remove Skeev's float
  224: Feeee? Peeeeeeee!
  225: 1 Second
  226: Very well. I'll send it off to the Vault then. MAYBE it can clear up the storerooms.
  227: Whoa. How did you escape?
  228: Whoa. How did you escape? You better get back inside before Barkus gets mad.
    C'mon...
  229: Oh-keeee
  230: Shamble off

    Like I said before, I can make you a full-fledged Citizen for $200. You'll have free passage
     through the gate, no hassles. I can print out the papers, register your serial number,
     and have you on your way in five minutes.
  232: What does it take to become a real Citizen?
  233: And what if I do? I could go tell him right now that you're selling fake Citizenship
    papers.
  234: I sure hope so. I can be pretty persuasive.
  235: We'll see about that.
  236: Ha! I'd like to see you try. Wallace'll never believe you.
  237: |-
    Oh, I think he will once he sees the fake citizenship papers you gave me. Of course, if you
     happen to have some cash on you, it can be our little secret.
  238: We'll see about that.
  239: I'll take the Citizenship papers, then.
  240: Well, $200's too steep for me. I might be back if I get some more money.
  241: No, thanks. Maybe some other time.
  242: What does it take to become a real Citizen?
  243: Hmmmm. How much for the Citizenship papers again?
  244: If I have to pry it from his dead fingers, I will.
  245: How do you become a real Citizen?
  246: Nothing, never mind.
  247: No, thanks. Maybe some other time.
  248: |-
    If you're not born a Citizen, then you have to take a test to become a Citizen. Number of
     Outsiders that have taken the test and become Citizens? Zero. Your chances? LESS than zero.
  249: What is this test?
  250: I see. How much for those papers again?
  251: Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  252: |-
    Gregory, the Proconsul, gives a "test" to any Outsiders who want to become Citizens. It
     measures their intelligence and perception, and you have to be damned lucky to pass it, too.
     Most Citizens would have trouble with it.
  253: So what makes it so hard?
  254: I see. How much for those pspers again?
  255: Hmmmm. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
  256: |-
    Since most Outsiders can't read, do trigonometry, or spell "Australopithecus," you figure it
     out. It's just an excuse to keep Outsiders from becoming Citizens.
  257: I see. How much for those papers again?
  258: Hmmm. Maybe we'll talk some other time.
