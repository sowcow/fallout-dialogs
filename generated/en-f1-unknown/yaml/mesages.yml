MORBID:
  100: You see Doc Morbid.
  101: I'm Doc Morbid, can I help you?
  102: Yeah, I need some help.
  103: I need some medical assistance.
  104: No, not today.
  105: Nng.
  106: Ya.
  107: Well, ok, then. Do come back.
  108: |-
    Well, if not today, then perhaps sometime in the near
     future.
  109: Hopefully not. Bye.
  110: We'll just have to see, now won't we. But I doubt it.
  111: Hmm, lets have a look.
  112: |-
    You seem to be in nearly perfect health. That will be $10
     for the examination.
  113: Ten caps for you to tell me that? You gotta be kidding.
  114: Here you go. Take your money.
  115: |-
    I never joke. Especially when it comes to physical trauma.
     You will pay or I'll have to resort to other forms of
     compensation, many of which are much more painful then
     just paying my fee.
  116: Ok, here's your money.
  117: Bite me. I'm leaving.
  118: |-
    Have it your way. Cougar, Flash. Show our 'patient' to
     the lab.
  119: Thank you for your business. Come again.
  120: |-
    You do not have enough money. I have a very special way
     of dealing with debtors - I don't. Flash and Cougar,
     take our new found source of income to the lab for
     processing.
  121: 'Ok, I have your test results:'
  122: 'You are '
  123: The total cost will be $
  124: |-
    . Payment is due before
     treatment. No exceptions. Will you pay?
  125: Yes, I will pay.
  126: No, I don't have the money. Will you float me?
  127: No.
  128: Ya.
  129: Nuh.
  130: |-
    No. I don't loan anyone, and I mean anyone, any amount
     of money. Go away, you pauper.
  131: It's your life. Good-Bye.
  132: Excellent. Let's begin. This might hurt a little . . .
  133: There you go. Come back again!
  134: Oh, back so soon. What can I help you with?
  135: I need healing.
  136: Nothing, just making small talk.
  137: Wock!
  138: Please make it somewhere else, I'm busy.
  139: |-
    Hmmm. I don't like your looks, stranger. But what can
     I do for you? I never, ever turn away a paying customer.
  140: I need some help.
  141: I need some medical assistance.
  142: Nothing today, thanks.
  143: Hep.
  144: |-
    Oh, It's you again. I like your style, even if I don't like
     you. What can I help you with, now?
  145: I need healing.
  146: Nothing, just making small talk.
  147: Wock!
  148: Oh, It's a customer! What can I help you with?
  149: I need healing.
  150: Nothing, just making small talk.
  151: You seem exited to see me. Why?
  152: Wock!
  153: |-
    My business has dropped off recently. I'm happy to see
     any customers, these days. Not that I mind your company, of course.
  154: Excellent, I need some healing.
  155: Why has your business dropped off?
  156: Of course, I understand. Have a good day.
  157: Well, if you do need anything, please stop by. No one can beat my service!
  158: In case you haven't noticed, I got some competition.
  159: |2-
     Complaining to Killian won't do anything. He doesn't see
     anything wrong with the newcomers.
  160: |2-
     Those damn Children have moved in next door, and
     all, um, much of my business has gone to them. I don't like it, but I can't
     lower my prices to match theirs. I can only provide better service.
  161: Ahh, I do need some healing.
  162: Hmm, better prices, interesting. Thank you.
  163: |-
    Ahh, a repeat customer. Excellent these days! How can
     I help you?
  164: I need healing.
  165: Nothing, just making small talk.
  166: Wock!
  167: |-
    I hope you have a good reason for disturbing me. My time is extremely
     valuable.
  168: I'm dying here! Please help!
  169: I'm sorry for disturbing you, but I need assistance.
  170: Aggh!
  171: |-
    I don't find your humor funny. Please leave so I can
     return to my work.
  172: |-
    Hmm. Well, you seem fine to me. Perhaps you need some rest.
     Try the Crash House, around the corner. Good night.
  173: |-
    I'm sorry, I don't treat idiots at this time of night.
     Something about full moons and lunacy, I suppose.
     Have a good night.
  174: |-
    You again. I hope you have another good reason for disturbing
     me . . .
  175: I'm dying here! Please help!
  176: I'm sorry for disturbing you, but I need assistance.
  177: Aggh!
  178: perfectly healthy,
  179: slightly wounded,
  180: moderately wounded,
  181: seriously wounded,
  182: near death,
  183: " in my medical opinion."
  184: " according to my tests."
  185: " without a doubt."
  186: " in my humble opinion."
  187: " You are definitely suffering from poison."
  188: " You have been poisoned."
  189: " Did you know you are poisoned?"
  190: " You have a deadly toxin in your bloodstream."
  191: " You have minor radiation poisoning."
  192: " You have some serious radiation poisoning."
  193: " Your body has absorbed an incredible amount of radiation."
  194: |2-
     I have never seen such readings on my radscanner.
     I think you are about to die. I give you two to three weeks.
  195: " There is not much I can do about it."
  196: |-
    I hope you have a good reason for disturbing me. My time is extremely
     valuable.
  197: I'm dying here! Please help!
  198: I'm sorry for disturbing you, but I need some assistance.
  199: Aggh!
  200: I don't find your humor funny. Please leave so I can return to my work.
  201: |-
    Hmm. Well, you seem fine to me. Perhaps you need some rest. Try the
     Crash House, around the corner. Good night.
  202: |-
    I'm sorry, I don't treat idiots at night. Something about full moons
     and lunacy, I suppose. Have a good night.
  203: You again. I hope you have another good reason for disturbing me . . .
  204: Trespasser! This is a private room!
  205: "[]"
  206: "[]"
  207: Throw down, butcher!
  208: Wait!
  209: Ack!
  210: Don't try to talk your way out of this one!
  211: Why should I?
  212: I'm no danger to you!
  213: I'm putting a stop to your operation, right here, right now!
  214: 'No! I won''t let you shut down my operation! Gretch, get '
  215: Why?!
  216: I know what you are doing here, and I won't stop you.
  217: You are obviously far more powerful than I am.
  218: That is true. Unfortunately, you have seen too much. Hmm.
  219: " You will have to be dealt with. Sorry."
  220: |2-
     You must prove your sincerity. And I might be able to make a little
     profit out of this deal.
  221: What do you mean?
  222: No deals, no way.
  223: Fine. Have it your way!
  224: I will take something from you. And then we will be even.
  225: Okay.
  226: No way.
  227: Excellent!
  228: |-
    Doc Morbid reaches up with a surgical tool, and, before you can react,
     removes one of your eyes. It is extremely painful.
  229: Now, half of what you have just seen is mine again.
  230: 'YOU RIPPED OUT MY EYE! YOU MOTHER . . . '
  231: Now, now. Watch your language.
  232: The doctor is out.
  233: I know about you and Iguana Bob, you filthy butcher.
  234: Wh . . . what could you possibly mean?
  235: I had a little conversation with your troll . . .
  236: |-
    [He looks shiftily from side to side] That proves nothing. Gretch is a
     little . . . slow in the head. No one listens to him around here. You had
     best leave.
GENGAMBL:
  100: You see a gambler.
  101: Ack! It's a stick up!
  102: I don't want any trouble with you.
  103: He's got a gun!
  104: She's got a gun!
  105: Oh, it's you.
  106: I've heard a lot of bad things about you. Neat.
  107: You've gotten off to a bad start, huh?
  108: You horrible person. Killing those kids. I can't believe it.
  109: |-
    I've heard that there are some bounty hunters after you. Have
     you killed them, too?
  110: Don't talk to me.
  111: Geez, you offed the Mayor, didn't you?
  112: |-
    Oh, when Killian was alive, I didn't like this place. Now it's
     OK to come here.
  113: Go away.
  114: Hey, how are you doing today? I'm doing OK.
  115: Hey, how are you doing tonight? I'm doing OK.
  116: Leave me alone. I'm on a hot streak.
  117: Baby, those slot machines are mine.
  118: Gimme sumthing to drink, will you bub?
  119: Grrr! This place sucks!
  120: I'm making the big bucks, now.
LEON:
  100: You see Leone.
  101: If you want company, rent a hooker. I'm busy.
  102: Not until the boss says so. Just ignore him and he'll go away.
  103: Not until the boss says so. Just ignore her and she'll go away.
  105: Give me a break. Anyone can bust a knee of break fingers. It just don't have
    the shock people like is used to.
GENVAULT:
  100: You see a Vault dweller.
  101: I can't believe that you betrayed us!
  102: Traitor!
  103: I hate you. Why did you ever come back?!
  104: I hope you choke on your vileness!
  105: "[]"
  106: "[]"
  107: "[]"
  108: "[]"
  109: Thank you for saving us.
  110: |-
    I was a little unsure that you could do it,
     but I trust you now.
  111: Thank you! Thank you!
  112: |-
    You are a hero. My little boy wants to be just like you when he grows
     up. I don't know if I like that.
  113: |-
    You are a heroine. My little girl wants to be
     just like you when she grows up. I don't know if I like that.
  114: You are a swell guy!
  115: You are a swell gal!
  116: Are you sure you need that in here?
  117: That's a weapon!
  118: Have you actually used that against someone?
  119: |-
    Why do you think it is necessary to carry a
     weapon in here?
  120: It's good to see you again.
  121: I'm glad you are doing well.
  122: |-
    You look OK to me. All those rumors must be
     untrue.
  123: 'Hi '
  124: |-
    . Keep
     up the good work.
  125: |-
    I hope everything is going well out there.
     We sure could use the water.
  126: |-
    We are starting to run out of water. This
     is terrible!
  127: |-
    Please hurry and find that chip. We need
     you.
  128: |-
    I'm glad you are doing well. Keep up the
     good work.
  129: |-
    I hate to say this, but if you don't find
     the water chip soon, we're all going to
     die.
  130: |-
    My little one is always crying in the middle
     of the night for a drink of water and I
     can't give her anything.
  131: We're not going to make it, are we?
  132: The water rations are coming to an end.
  133: |-
    The hydroponics section has closed down
     now. It means our food supply is running out.
  134: |-
    Hmm. You still look human to me. It can't be
     all that bad outside.
  135: 'Hi '
  136: "."
  137: I hope you are doing well on your quest.
  138: See you around.
  139: Have you talked to the Overseer recently?
  140: |-
    The Overseer is very concerned about the
     status of your mission.
  141: |-
    You need to hurry. We can't afford any failure
     on your part.
  142: I hope you are doing the best you can.
  143: This is no time to rest, get back out there.
  144: |-
    This isn't what you are supposed to be doing,
     is it?
  145: We're going to die, and it's your fault.
  146: Don't just stand here, get back out there! Now!
  147: If we die, it will be your fault.
  148: The outside has corrupted you, hasn't it?
  149: Just leave me alone.
  150: "I think you should leave me and my family\n alone, "
  151: |-
    . It
     would be for the best.
  152: You should be ashamed of yourself.
  153: And to think that I used to like you.
  154: The Vault dweller refuses to talk to you.
  155: An empty stare meets your request to talk.
  156: I regret that we picked you to go outside.
  157: The water is foul, but your company is worse.
  158: |-
    Go away. Just leave. You can redeem yourself
     by finding that water chip.
  159: I hope you are satisfied.
  160: The Vault dweller refuses to talk to you.
  161: |-
    You caused this! You probably broke the water chip
     in the first place, too!
  162: I hate you. I really, really hate you.
  163: The Vault dweller just sobs great big tears.
  164: Your request to talk is met by a cold stare.
  165: Thank you.
  166: It's late. Come back some other time.
  167: The Vault dweller is resting.
RNDCOAST:
  100: You see several odd floating creatures...
  101: You see a small swarm of rats rapidly approaching.
  102: You see a group of peasants being attacked by raiders!
  103: You see a couple of people out fishing.
  104: There is a grisly dead corpse near by that's been partially eaten.
  105: You stumble upon some water pools..
  106: Out of dire thirst, you drink some water.. It doesn't taste so good.
  107: The water looks highly radioactive and foul.
  108: Ahhh..
  109: Arrgg..
  110: Yuck!
FOLSCOUT:
  100: You see Jerry of the Follower's Scouts.
  101: You see Basbear of the Follower's Scouts.
  102: You see Richard of the Follower's Scouts.
  103: You see Jason of the Follower's Scouts.
  104: You see Shadow of the Follower's Scouts.
  105: You see Lynne of the Follower's Scouts.
  106: You see Gwendolyne of the Follower's Scouts.
  107: You see Rosa of the Follower's Scouts.
  108: You see Elizabeth of the Follower's Scouts.
  109: You see Rebeca of the Follower's Scouts.
  110: Who travels the halls of the Followers?
  111: Huh?
  112: 'I am '
  113: ". I come in peace."
  114: 'I am '
  115: ". Your destroyer."
  116: Who are the Followers?
  117: OK. I can see that you are a little slow. Who you?
  118: 'Me '
  119: ". You dead."
  120: 'Me '
  121: ". Me hep."
  122: Me kill!
  123: 'Me '
  124: ". Me go."
  125: |-
    You want to help? I think you will need to talk to Nicole or Jake
     if you want to help us. They have more time for dealing with slower people.
  126: OK. Just stay out of trouble around here.
  127: Do you see to end the evil of the Children?
  128: Yes. I want to wipe out those scum.
  129: No. I'd rather kill you wimps.
  130: Who are these Children?
  131: Why would I want to kill children?
  132: |-
    Excellent! Go talk to Nicole and she will be able to tell you how
     you can help us.
  133: |-
    The Children are an occult group who worship some dark god. Personally,
     I think there is something about them that reeks of evil.
  134: I will kill them.
  135: I don't know. They sound too strong for me.
  136: What can I do to help?
  137: Forget it! There is no way I will help you.
  138: |-
    They are a strong lot, but I think with someone of your skills,
     you will be able to get in and help us destroy them.
  139: I'll do it, then.
  140: No. I don't think I will help.
  141: |-
    Suit yourself. If they take over the wastelands, don't say we
     didn't warn you.
  142: "If you talk to Nicole, she will be able to tell you more of what\n can be
    done to stop them. "
  143: Thank you. Goodbye.
  144: |-
    Not children. We wouldn't think of harming them. No. These are the
     Children of the Cathedral. A nasty group of people.
  145: In that case, sure - I'll waste them.
  146: |-
    Oh. I thought you were talking about kids. Nevermind. I don't think
     I'll help.
  147: What can you tell me about these Children?
  148: |-
    We are the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are trying to bring peace
     to the wastelands.
  149: Sounds like a good idea. Good luck with it.
  150: How do you plan on doing that?
  151: That seems highly unlikely.
  152: |-
    We are working to bring about tolerance to those in the wastelands
     for those few unfortunates who have been mutated by man's destructive nature.
  153: Good luck with that, then.
  154: |-
    In all of history, we have never been able to get tolerance. Why do
     you think the War happened?
  155: That's just a bunch of bull.
  156: |-
    You are right in saying that we, as humans, have been close-minded.
     However, there is always hope.
  157: Good luck to you, then.
  158: I think you are right. Here, let me make you more open-minded with this.
  159: Be that as it may, your opinion was not requested. Goodbye.
  160: |-
    A cynic in our midst. I am sure you have your reasons. Regardless,
     I am certain we can bring about some type of understanding.
  161: Good luck to you then. Goodbye.
  162: |-
    I've heard that the Children have been able to get some of our secrets.
     I wonder how that is happening?
  163: I believe that there is a spy somewhere around here.
  164: I know. I am selling your secrets to them.
  165: I am sure you are just imagining things. How can they know anything?
  166: |-
    Truly? I thought as much myself, but feared that I would never have
     been able to get much support on the theory.
  167: Do you have any clues as to who it could be?
  168: I'm glad to know that. Thanks for your time.
  169: You are the double agent!!!
  170: |-
    Not really. The only thing I can think of is that the person would have
     to have access to some information and have access to the outside. You might
     want to look to the initiates or scouts.
  171: Thanks. Goodbye.
  172: Nicole will be pleased, then, to know that I killed the agent.
  173: You must be right. Thank you for setting me straight.
  174: |-
    I think you are the double agent. Trying to trick me, I see. Well now
     you DIE!
  175: |-
    Great job on wasting that agent. Now we might have a chance against
     those Children.
  176: Good luck to you.
  177: I can help train you to become more efficient in your fighting.
  178: Would you? That would be wonderful.
  179: There you go. Maybe that will help you on your fighting.
GENGLOW1:
  100: You see a glowing ghoul.
  101: Arrrr!
  102: Mmmm!
  103: Uck!
NEAL:
  100: You see Neal, the bartender.
  101: You see a bartender.
  102: He looks overworked.
  103: Hey! Don't think you're going to get away with that, thief!
  104: We're closed. Come back around four o'clock.
  105: Zzzz
  106: Welcome to the Skum Pitt. What can I do ya for?
  107: Uh, I'll have a drink.
  108: I'm looking for information.
  109: 'My name''s '
  110: ". What is this place?"
  111: Gaa hnnngh!
  112: Great. Whaddya want?
  113: Nuka-cola, 3 caps.
  114: Beer, 5 caps.
  115: The hard stuff, 20 caps.
  116: Okay, so whaddya wanna know?
  117: What's the scoop on this town?
  118: Who's the dangerous-looking stranger in the corner?
  119: Who're the jerks?
  120: |-
    [Neal looks at you quizzically for a moment.] Haven't you ever seen a bar
     before, stranger? This is my place, the Skum Pitt. You buy drinks here. And you
     tip me.
  121: Uh, right. I knew that. So, can I get a drink?
  122: Yeah. Um, can I get some other information?
  123: Oh. Thanks.
  124: Yeah, same to you, buddy.
  125: What’s that trophy on the shelf?
  126: |-
    Well, just over there to the west of us is Gizmo's casino. I'd be
     surprised if you didn't know about it; most of the people here are the ones who
     just finished losing their money there. Over in the other part of town you got
     Killian's general store, and Marcelles's Crash House. Killian's a good guy, runs
     a straight joint, carries everything you need. The Crash House is where you sleep
     it off when you've been in here for too long. [Neal chuckles.]
  127: Thanks. Can I get a drink?
  128: Thanks for the information. See you around.
  129: |-
    Fella's called Tycho. Apparently a ranger from back east or something.
     Pretty nasty fighter, from what I hear, but a straight-up character.
  130: Mind if I ask some other questions?
  131: |-
    Oh, them. They're the Skulz. They're a local gang. All the riff-raff.
     Sometimes they start fights or cause a little trouble. Usually Killian keeps them
     in line, though.
  132: Here ya go. Enjoy.
  133: Hey! You stole my urn!
  134: |-
    That's not a trophy, it's an urn. It contains my wife's ashes -
     besides this bar, it is the most important thing in my life.
  135: Anything else?
  136: Looking for some more information.
  137: No thanks.
  138: Oh.
  139: Yeah, I'll have a drink.
  140: Come back when you've got some money.
  141: What'll it be, friend?
  142: What happened to that trophy you used to have up there?
  143: |-
    Thank you. You can't know what this means to me. You'll never pay
     for a drink in this bar again.
  144: I've got your urn back for you.
  145: |-
    Some slime stole it. It wasn't a trophy, it was an urn. It contained my
     wife's ashes - besides this bar, it was the most important thing in my life.
  146: |-
    Get the hell outta here you goddamn punks! If any of ya ever touch her
     again I'll kill the whole lot o' ya!
  147: The day I can't handle little shits like you is the day I die!
  148: What the hell ya doin'? We're closed. Get on out of here!
  149: Ya damn kids, I'll show you a thing or two!
HAROLD:
  100: You see Harold.
  101: |2-

    Spare change, old friend, old pal?  Can you help a poor mutant down on his luck? [Cough]
  102: Yeah, here's $25. Good luck to you.
  103: How about $5.
  104: Sorry, don't have any money on me.
  105: Keep away from me!
  106: Uhhh?
  107: |2-

    Geez. You're worse off than I am, friend. Luck to you.
  108: |2-

    Oh, kind of ya, friend. Very kind. You know, if I could clear the gunk out of there, you, just might find a tear in Old Harold's eye.
  109: Why is that?
  110: You're welcome.
  111: |2-

    [Cough] Rest of the Hubbers' been picking on me like a bad booger since I came back to town.  I can't leave, though.  When the deals are done [wheez] it's still my home.
  112: What happened to you?
  113: Who are the Hubbers?
  114: Hope things get better. See you around.
  115: |2-

    Well, after the Great War, my Vault was one of the first to open. [Takes a deep breath] Whew.  Long time.
  116: Tell me more about those days.
  117: No, no. I meant what happened to change you?
  118: |2-

    All started with the sirens.  I was young, but ohh, I do remember that.  Lotta terrible years followed.  And I remember walking outta the Vault late one morning.
  119: What did you do then?
  120: Where was your Vault located?
  121: Do you realize how old that makes you?
  122: |2-

    You know, [cough] I'm not real sure anymore.  West, I think.  Uh wait - east?  Ooh I don't know.  [Hacking cough]
  123: What did you do then?
  124: |2-

    Well, I was a trader.  Did pretty good making a circuit between survivors.  Lost a lotta good people, though. [Coughs]
  125: How?
  126: |2-

    Gangers got'em.  Scavengers attacking the caravans.  And mutants, son of a dog, if they weren't springing up like rabbits with a mission. [cough] Had to have an army of guards with, just to do a deal.
  127: Didn't the guards help?
  128: Where were the mutants coming from?
  129: |2-

    Course they helped, ya bonehead!  Just too damn many to handle!
  130: How did you survive the mutant attacks?
  131: |2-

    Didn't.  Got killed. [Laughing cough] Love that joke.
  132: Uh, yeah.
  133: |2-

    Everywhere!  Hell, seemed like you couldn't fart without hitting one.  But mostly in the northwest.
  134: Did you explore that area?
  135: Why didn't you just avoid the area?
  136: You farted northwest?
  137: "[Laughs] Pretty good...Noo..."
  138: |2-

    We mounted an expedition.  God, Richard.  Richard Grey.  Led a small group of us up there.
  139: Richard Grey?
  140: Where exactly did you go?
  141: |2-

    Needed to see what was there.  Maybe stop whatever was churnin them boogers out.  We thought we were prepared.  Were we wrong.
  142: What did you do?
  143: |2-

    I can't remember the route or anything.  But I am damn sure it was northwest, though...I think.
  144: Is there a shorter version of this story?
  145: What about your leader?
  146: |2-

    Richard Grey was a doctor.  Little older than me, and friend was he smart.  He found the source.
  147: And what was that?
  148: |2-

    I like telling it my way.  Short version will cost you 25 extra, friend.  Which will it be?
  149: Ok, long it is.
  150: Short.
  151: Short, but I don't have the cash.
  152: How about neither, you old fart?
  153: |2-

    Well, you seem like an okay sort.  I'll speed it up a bit.
  154: Thanks.
  155: Lying to a poor old mutant.  What's the world coming to? [cough]
  156: Little light on funds, huh?
  157: My way or walk away.  Your choice, friend.
  158: Walking.
  159: OK. Long it is.
  160: |2-

    Some sort of old military base.  We lost a lotta folks getting in there.
  161: How did you know this base was the cause?
  162: What were you running up against?
  163: |2-

    Robots and such.  Lot of'em.  Damn surprised they was still running after all this time, what with the war and all.  Whooa boy they tore us a good one.
  164: What did you do once you got past the robots?
  165: |2-

    Because it was like someone went bargain shopping at mutantland!  Geez!  Cheaper by the dozens!  Can't figure any other reason except that being the factory.
  166: Did you examine the base closely?
  167: |2-

    We got pretty far inside.  Wasn't a lot of us left by then.  Grey, me and couple of others.
  168: And then?
  169: |2-

    One of them robots got Francine.  Mark was wounded, sent him back to the surface.  Then it was just me and Grey.
  170: What ever happened to Mark?
  171: What happened then?
  172: |2-

    To this day, I don't know.  He never made it back here, and...well I...couldn't face the wasteland again, so I...I never looked.
  173: What about you and Grey?
  174: |2-

    We made it to some sort of central core, like a plant of some sort.  That's when it happened.
  175: What?
  176: |2-

    A robot crane crashed into us.  Last I saw of Grey, he was flying through the air in-into some sort of acid bath.  I was in bad shape and...well I passed out.
  177: How did you survive?
  178: And you never saw Grey again?
  179: Didn't.  Got killed...[Laughs then coughs] God, I love that joke.
  180: Yeah, I can tell.
  181: |2-

    Well, I have no idea.  Woke up in the wasteland, barely hanging on.  Got lucky and some traders I knew found me days later.  Good thing, since I was already changing.  They brought me here, and here I've been since.
  182: How did you mutate?
  183: Quite a great story.  Thanks.
  184: Well...Thanks for letting me tell it.
  185: So that was the short version?
  186: Well . . . thanks for letting me tell it.
  187: For me it was.
  188: |2-

    No, you idiot!  I just said I never saw him again, didn't I?
  189: How did you survive?
  190: |2-

    All's I know, is it was something inside that base.
  191: Do you think it could have been radiation?
  192: Sorry, tough break. Thanks for the story.
  193: |2-

    How the hell should I know?  Grey would've known if anybody could. [sigh] Anyway, that's how the deal went down.
  194: Thanks for the story.
  195: |2-

    Yeah, about a century or two in dog years.
  196: What?
  197: |2-

    Nevermind, that was from my time.  I'm cranky, old and I've been that way ever since I changed.
  198: What did you do before this happened to you?
  199: |2-

    Well, I got mutated.  Sure wasn't born this ugly.  Happened when we tried to find out where all the mutants were coming from.
  200: What happened?
  201: |2-

    It's in the past.  Probably should stay that way.
  202: Please tell me what happened, it may help me now.
  203: Have it your way.
  204: |2-

    Well, if you put it that way.  I guess it couldn't hurt.
  205: Thanks.
  206: |2-

    No, no.  It's too painful, even now.  Thanks for the help, friend.  Good luck to you.
  207: |2-

    You're in the Hub, right?  People who live in the Hub?  Hubbers.  Get it? [cough] Sheesh!  Thanks for the help and good luck...think you're gonna need it.
  208: |2-

    You're as bad as the rest of them. [Wheezing cough]
  209: |2-

    Oh well, thanks anyway. [cough]
  210: |2-

    Hey, can you help me out, friend?
  211: Yeah, here's $25.
  212: Take $5.
  213: Don't bug me.
  214: Uhhh?
  215: |2-

    Hey, 'preciate it!  Gotta admit, when I first saw you, [cough] I figured you might hassle me.
  216: Why do you say that?
  217: Nah, not me!  Have a good one.
  218: |2-

    Oh, hey, it's you again.
  219: Here's $20, if you need it.
  220: Hi.
  221: Uhh?
  222: Just putting me on, huh?
  223: |2-

    Anything I can do for you?
  224: Heard any good words recently?
  225: I need info on the Deathclaw, and I hear you're the man.
  226: What's your story?
  227: Nope
  228: The whole thing?  Well...
  229: |2-

    Oooh, well thanks.  Hope it wasn't too much of a strain. [coughs]
  230: Oooh, that thing.  Friend, that is nightmare city.  Why the hell you asking
    about that?
  231: Gonna kill it.
  232: If it catches up with me, I want to know what to do.
  233: Okay.  Well, it's like a damn big man, is what it is.  Got spikes and claws
    that can cut through the heaviest armor.  But don't let the size fool ya, it's
    quick.
  234: Any weaknesses?
  235: Well, from what I've heard, maybe whack it in the head?  I'd try the eyes.  'Course,
    there's a problem there.
  236: What kind of problem?
  237: You can't look at 'em!  It is said the Death Claw can hypnotize just by lookin'.  Then
    it walks up and "boom", you're et!
  238: Great, thanks.
  239: Good luck to you...you're gonna need it.
  240: Could be.
  241: You don't want to know about the Death Claw, and I ain't gonna be the one to
    tell ya.
  242: Well, heard one of Decker's men has somebody from the Brotherhood of Steel
    trapped in Old Town.
  243: Thanks.
  244: I don't believe this one, but some say an army of mutants is on the way. [cough]
  245: Thanks.
  246: Leave me alone. [cough]
  247: I want to talk to you.
  248: Here's some cash.
  249: Well, I don't wanta talk to you.  Go away!
  250: Don't want your money.  Go away. [cough]
  251: As much as I love trading, I don't have anything to exchange. [cough]
  252: I need to sleep for a while.  I'm kinda tired.
  253: You might want to be more careful. [cough] I've heard that you've wasted several
    people recently.
  254: Umm...Decker's looking for you.  He wants to talk. [cough]
  255: All I got is clothes and freedom, and the latter's debatable.
  256: Brilliant guy.  A doctor and philosopher.  Long ago he lead the expedition
    where I got changed into a mutant.
  257: Who?  Is he some sort of sex therapist?  I could use one, you know.
  258: Mutants.  Doesn't matter what they call themselves.
  259: Oh, him.  He leads the Thieves Circle.  Thinks he's Robin Hood. [cough] He's
    alright, I guess.
  260: I've seen religions come and religions go, and I hope this one goes.  Soon.
  261: Yeah, I came from a Vault.  Too many people, not enough food and water.  But
    you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
  262: Horrible.  The world just went insane.  Long ago, but I'll never forget it.  Never.
  263: "[Cough] Trouble.  Nothing but trouble."
  264: Well, like I said...
  265: Nothing, thanks.
  266: |-
    Spare change, old friend, old pal? Can you help a poor mutant
     down on his luck? [Cough]
  267: |-
    Spare change, old friend, old pal? Can you help a poor mutant

SOPHIA:
  100: You see Sophia, an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.
  101: Ok, does anyone have any questions?
  102: Remember to ask questions if you don't understand something. Don't be shy.
  103: Review your notes.
  104: We'll be having another test tomorrow for those of you that are on section
    14.
  105: I'm sorry, but I can't talk right now. I have a class to run.
  106: I understand you have something for me.
  107: Yes. Here you are.
  108: Yes, but I don't have it with me right now.
  109: You.
  110: I'm sorry, but I have a class to run. Please don't disturb me.
  111: You shouldn't be here. Vree doesn't like to be bothered at night. This is the
    time we meditate.
  112: We are meditating. Please leave. Come back in the morning.
  113: Leave us.
  114: Have some respect. Don't bother someone while they're meditating.
  115: You Initiates have a lot to learn. Please leave.
  116: Don't bother me.
  117: We are not available during the night. Please see us in the morning.
  118: It's night. You should be in bed, unless you have guard duty, in which case
    you should be at your post.
  200: Hello Initiate. How may I help you?
  201: I understand you have something for me?
  202: Yes, here you are.
  203: Yes, but I don't have it with me right now.
  204: Me? Nope, sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else.
  205: Uk.
  206: Thank you very much. It was nice of you to drop these off.
  207: Um, thank you. Are you okay? Well anyway, it was nice of you to drop these
    off.
  208: |-
    My research would have been delayed without them. It's good to see we have such a trustworthy Initiate.
     I knew getting an outsider wouldn't be a bad decision. If you go see Michael he will have something for you.
  301: |-
    Greetings.  I have not seen you here before, are you lost?
     May I be of service?
  302: Uh......
  303: Could you direct me to the library?
  304: I am looking for Vree.
  305: What is this place?
  306: If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!
  307: |-
    I can't believe the kind of people we accept as initiates these
     days.  God help us.
  308: |-
    This is the library.  Here we keep records of all technical data on
     weaponry and technology, and, of course, the history of the Brotherhood.
  309: I need a water-chip repaired.  Can you help me?
  310: I'd like to know more about the weapons you make here.
  311: Is this the place where I would find holo-disks?
  312: Nevermind, thank you for your time.
  313: I'm looking for a big gun to improve my people-killing skills.
  314: I am Vree's assistant.  Vree is over there.
  315: Thank you.
  316: What is it you do as Vree's assistant?
  317: |-
    My area of expertise is the history of the Brotherhood.  It sounds
     like a manufacturing problem, perhaps you should ask Vree?
  318: I thought the scribes knew this kind of stuff.
  319: I'd like to know about the Brotherhood's history.
  320: Lotta help you are!
  321: OK, thanks for your help.
  322: |-
    You must speak with Vree, the head scribe, about that.  I have more
     important things to do.
  323: I will go ask Vree.
  324: More important things to do?  Like what?
  325: You don't consider the Brotherhood's weaponry to be important?
  326: |-
    We have many holo-disks here in the library.  They are divided
     between history, technology and weapon design.
  327: I would like to see a holo-disk on your technology.
  328: I would like to see a holo-disk on weapon design.
  329: I would like to see a holo-disk on the Brotherhood's history.
  330: I was sent here to ask Vree about the history of the Brotherhood.
  331: |-
    My area of specialty is the Brotherhood's history.  It seems that
     some people around here have forgotten the importance of our history.
  332: What can you tell me about the Brotherhood's history?
  333: What could be more important than history?
  334: Must be near your time of the month, huh?
  335: I'd like to ask somebody about weapons.
  336: |-
    Like keeping the history of the Brotherhood.  It seems some people
     around here have forgotten just how important our history is.
  337: |-
    Vree seems to think that the research of new weaponry and the
     information gathered from Mutant autopsies is more important than our
     history.  She has forgotten that our history is a vital part of our lives.
     It has gotten so bad that many of the new initiates don't even know who
     Roger Maxson is or what exactly he did for us.
  338: |-
    I'd like to learn more about the Brotherhood's history.  Do you have
     any information you can give me?
  339: Hmmm, it looks like Vree is the person I want to talk to. Good Bye.
  341: |-
    It sounds like Vree's got the right idea!  Who needs to know this
     garbage anyway!?!
  342: |-
    I agree that history is important, but new technology and better
     weapons is what I'm looking for.
  343: You need to speak with Vree about things of that nature.
  344: |-
    These are things that only Scribes and Paladins have access to.
     Vree may be able to help you.
  345: Thank you, I'll go ask Vree.
  346: Is there any holo-disks that I can have access to?
  347: You're obviously not the right person to be talking to. Good Bye.
  348: |-
    Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history.
     Unlike others around here.  Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.
  349: Thank you.
  350: I don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.
  351: |-
    Our history is available to everyone.  So that they may learn of our
     great history...Not that any one ever looks at them.
  352: I would like to see anything you have on the Brother's history.
  353: Really? I don't care either, just show me the guns.
  354: |-
    Greetings.  I have not seen you here before, are you lost?  May I be
     of service?
  355: Uh......
  356: Could you direct me to the library?
  357: I was sent here to speak with Vree about the Brotherhood's history.
  358: If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!
  359: |-
    You didn't get far with that did you?  Vree is to busy with her
     "experiments" to care about history any more.
  360: Well, then who can I talk to about the history of the Brotherhood?
  361: Yeah, the Brotherhood seems to be filled with idiots.
  362: Neither do I.  Good Bye.
  363: I will not talk with you.
  364: How can I help you?
  365: What do you do here?
  366: Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.
  367: Sorry, I thought you were someone else.  Good bye.
  368: I am Vree's assistant.
  369: Thank you.
  370: What is it you do as Vree's assistant?
  371: |-
    Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history.

  372: Thank you.
  373: I don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.
  374: |-
    I gave you the disk with some of our early writings on it.  Just
     load it up into your PIPBoy 2000 and you will be able to read it.
  375: Thank you.
  376: I don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.
  377: I don't like your attitude, and I choose not to talk to you.
  378: So be it. Good bye!
  379: I'm sorry, I was very rude and I apologize.
  380: 'I accept your apology.  Now how can I help you? '
  381: What do you do here?
  382: Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.
  383: Sorry, I thought you were someone else.  Good bye.
  384: I am Vree's assistant.  Vree is in the Learning Center.
  400: You see an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.
GHDORGRD:
  100: You see a ghoul guard.
  101: Go away! You're not wanted here.
  102: OK. Nice meeting you, too.
  103: Huh?
  104: I'm on duty. If you want to see Set, you gotta do it inside.
  105: The door is locked. You'll have to come back later when it's dark.
  106: Thanks.
  107: Huh?
  108: I told you to leave. Your kind is not wanted here.
  109: Right.
  110: Myuh!
  111: The doors don't open until dark.
  112: I need to get in there. Is there any way you can help me?
  113: Hmm, OK.
  114: Ugh!
  115: Well, I guess it can't hurt.
  116: |-
    I wish I could help you, but Set would tan my ass if I did.
     You know how it is . . . always gotta do what the big guy says.
  117: Yeah, I understand. Thanks.
IZO:
  100: He has the stance and musculature of a master martial artist.

  106: The water pump isn't working.

  112: The water pump isn't working.

  114: |-

     install the missing parts.
  115: |-
    You somehow manage to destroy the parts while cutting
     your hand for 1 point of damage.
  116: You are having difficulties making these parts work.

  112: Those fools should have known better than to mess with our god!
  113: Be gone, lest you end up as those foolish Followers.
  114: None shall hinder the cleansing of the wastelands.
  115: We offered them peace. They sought war.
  116: Where did that foolish ghoul come from?
  117: Somewhere there has to be a list of all the Followers.
  118: Unfortunately, we can only search this place during the day.
  119: We must be wary of the Nightkin, for they search during the darkened hours.
  120: May you live in interesting times!
COOKSHEL:
  100: The shelf contains bottles of various items.
  101: |-
    The cooks are extremely watchful of their store of food
     and prevent you from taking anything.
LADDER:
  100: |-
    You open the manhole cover and climb out
     of the dank sewers.
  101: |-
    You strain your shoulders on the manhole
     cover, and then slip off the ladder.

  106: The electronic security is already disarmed.
  107: You disarm the electronic security.
SEMICOMP:
  100: You see a dim glowing computer.
  101: |-
    There is a trickle of power coming in. Most of the power seems
     to have been routed to maintain the few systems which are still
     semi-functioning.
  102: You notice nothing unusual.
  103: This computer is making a weird humming noise.
  104: |-
    A monitor connected to this computer is printing the word
     'System failure.' over and over.
  105: This computer appears to have been attacked by a ghoul.
  106: Lights are flashing on this computer but it seems random to you.
  107: This computer gives you a harmless shock when you touch it.
  108: |-
    Upon inspection you notice that this computer has been used
     as a home by rats.
  109: Random numbers are printing across a screen connected to this system.
  110: |-
    This computer is making the worst noise you have ever heard. The
     word 'Jared' is displayed on the monitor.
  111: Half of this computer is black and charred from an old fire.
LOXLEY:
  100: You see Loxley, leader of the Thieves' Guild.
  101: It's a little gift from me Da and Mum.  Actually, a few generations before
    that.  Do you like it?
  102: It suits you.
  103: No, it hurts my ears.
  104: Why, thank you.  Have to work a bit to keep it with so little refinement about,
    don't you know.  But enough of that. Loxley's the name.  And yours is?
  105: 'I''m '
  106: "."
  107: What's it to you?
  108: What is this place?
  110: Bloody impressive making it through the defenses like that!  What's your name,
    luv?
  109: Bloody fine job making it through the defenses, mate!  I'm rather impressed.  Toss
    me your name!
  111: 'I''m '
  112: "."
  113: What's it to you?
  114: What is this place?
  115: You got a real interesting accent, my friend.
  116: You talk like an idiot.
  117: Nuhhh?
  118: Quite pleased to make your acquaintance actually...for now.  Let's get the
    other bit of politeness taken care of, shall we?  What the bloody, bloody, bloody
    hell are you doing here!
  119: I want to join the Circle.
  120: I need to ask you a few things.
  121: I'm taking you all off to jail.
  122: Oh, how nice.  A joiner.  Well, you've worked hard enough for a look-see.  But
    if you really want to join, then you'll have to take the Second Test.
  123: What's that?
  124: Sounds scary . . . How about I pass?
  125: Uh . . . what was the first test?
  126: Quite simple, really.  You prove yourself as a thief.  Succeed, and the world
    is yours!  If not, then you'll never see us again.  Except if you come looking.  And
    if you don't understand, that last bit is a threat.
  127: What's the test?
  128: Do you mean you'll move this whole place if I fail, or try to kill me.
  129: Are you threatening me?
  130: It's so, so simple.  In the Heights you'll find Daren Hightower's home all
    plump and ripe for the picking.  Are you ready for life!  Do you accept the challenge?
  131: I'm ready!
  132: Hell, no!
  134: That's the spirit, luv!
  133: That's the spirit, mate!
  135: Just talk to Jasmine in the room outside this chamber.  She'll give you details,
    a map, and a few little goodies to help you on your way.  But remember, if you
    even think about ratting us out to the cops, we'll be a memory before they arrive.  But
    enough gloom.  Cheerio, good luck, and ta-ta!
  136: Well, then why the bloody hell are you here?  Sightseeing?  The ambiance?  My
    handsome face?
  137: No, I came to ask you a few questions.
  138: Certainly not the face.
  139: You're right, I'd like to join the Circle.
  140: That's it?  A few questions!  Well, you're either incredibly brave or a total
    moron.  Ask away, ask away!...and then we'll show you to the door, shall we?
  141: You must be joking!  You think I'd fall for a line like that!  Get out, you
    commoner!
  142: Oh, quite the little attitude!  But, we're all friends here, aren't we?
  143: I don't see why.
  144: Your're right. I'm sorry.
  145: Ohhh, broken heart.  Our chance for camaraderie lost. [Sigh] Jasmine, show
    this little sod the door.
  146: Ooh, a little back and forth.  I like someone who plays the edge.  I think
    you'll be a great addition to our merry little band.  What say you?
  147: Okay!
  148: I say you're a total lunatic.
  149: Okay!
  150: Oh, bosh and bother.  Well, quite sorry to hear that, actually.  You would've
    made a fine thief.  But the Circle's not for the terminally stupid.  So, Jasmine,
    show our guest the door, please.
  151: Oh, what do you take me for?  If you want cold blooded murder, talk to Decker
    and his lot.  If you fail, which seems much more likely at this point, we will
    simple disappear.  Now, then care to try or not?
  152: Sure.
  153: Not.
  154: Oh, no.  I'm so afraid.  Life is so hard. Loxley, I'd rather be a coward for
    all of my life than to have a single moment of triumph.  Ah, just another wanker,
    aren't you.  Out!
  155: Haven't figured it out yet, have we?  The First Test was just getting here!  That's
    the only reason I'm considering you.
  156: Okay, I'll do whatever you want!!
  157: What's the next test?
  158: Well, all I need to do is ask you a few questions.
  159: Ha ha ha.  Ooh, that's quite amusing.  Take us to jail, will you?  And how,
    may I ask, do you plan this feat?
  160: Just come along quietly and no one will get hurt.
  161: Well, maybe I'll let you off this time.
  162: What's it to me?  It's simple, really.  Tell me your name, or we show you the
    door.
  163: 'Okay. I''m '
  164: "."
  165: How about I show you my boot?
  166: This is the famous Thieves' Circle!  I thought you would've known this, seeing's
    how you made it through all the defenses and whatnot.  But no matter.  You're
    quite promising, and the Circle could use someone like you.
  167: Okay, what do I have to do?
  168: No thanks. I would like to ask you some questions, though.
  169: Not a chance.
  170: Well, you made it through my defenses so you certainly have skills.  What's
    your name?
  171: 'I''m '
  172: "."
  173: What's it to you?
  174: What is this place?
  175: You got a real interesting accent, my friend.
  176: You talk like an idiot.
  177: What the hell do you want?
  178: What did I do? Why so hostile?
  179: To be away from you.
  180: Hey, I'm on your side. I'm here as a friend.
  181: I don't like you. Don't know why, don't care.
  182: Give me a chance!
  183: Well, you're just an idiot then, aren't you?
  184: Thanks for such a lovely moment.  Jasmine, show our guest out.
  185: Oh, how nice to see you again.  Do you have a little something for me?
  186: My resignation. I decided not to take your stupid test.
  187: I didn't get it yet.
  188: Here's the necklace . . .
  189: Ha!  Ha!  Well, done!  Congratulations.  You're now a member of the world famous
    Thieves' Circle.  Let's get Jasmine over here, and throw a topper, shall we?
  190: Oh, how funny.  I really must tell you, though, that I don't care much for
    this kind of a joke.  Kind of a chuckle.  Kind of a put-one-over-on-the-old-Loxley
    thing huh.  Tell you what.  One more chance.  Bring the necklace here.
  191: You're really just a complete pain in the ass, aren't you?
  192: Stupid!  Oh.  I'm so disappointed you feel this way.  Ah, well, our little
    Circle will just have to carry on without your scintillating presence.  So sad.  Jasmine,
    the door for our guest.  And no return privileges, hmm?
  193: Then what the bloody, bloody hell are you doing here?  Shoo!  Go away.  Only
    this time come back with the necklace.
  194: Anything interesting go on around here?
  195: Tell me about the Hub.
  196: Heard any good rumors lately?
  197: Tell me more about the Circle.
  198: I'm looking for the missing caravans. Any suggestions?
  199: Well, the whole bloody town's in an uproar, what with the missing caravans
    and all.  Something of a pain.  Cuts into the Circle's business, don't you know?
  200: Do you know who might be responsible?
  201: Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?
  202: I don't know, but I hope they find out soon.  People are edgy and it makes
    our job a bit more sticky, say what?  Not to mention all the superstitious nonsense
    floating about.
  203: What kind of nonsense?
  204: Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?
  205: Oh, some bosh and bother that the Death Claw grabbed the caravans, and brought
    them up to its lair for an afternoon tea.
  206: Sounds yummy. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  207: Oh, absolutely.  We're all friends here.
  208: "[Sigh]  Why not?"
  209: Ask away, ask away.
  210: No, actually.  You had one.  Consider yourself lucky.  Goodbye, ta-ta.
  211: Nothing you'd be interested in.
  212: Try me.
  213: Okay, thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  214: Oh nothing.  Just the whole damn town's been up in arms with all the missing
    caravans.  That's all.
  215: Gee, thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  216: Oh, just the usual.  The merchant caravans get fat off the poor, while that
    villain Decker plays off everyone.
  217: Well, you've got the usual numbers of shops and things.  Mix in some Children
    of the Cathedral nut cases.  Add a dollop of Decker and his underground making
    life hard for us all.  Top it with a sprinkle of greedy merchants and that will
    just about cover it.
  218: Merchants are pretty much scum, huh?
  219: Sounds like you're a real Decker supporter.
  220: Next question, please.
  221: Too right!  That's why the Circle was formed, you see.  You got all those rich
    buggers, feeding off the poor.  And those poor are just waiting for a hero.  Because
    of the help we give them, they practically bow at our feet.
  222: What's wrong with making money?
  223: Just like Robin Hood.
  224: What's the harm?!  you little...well, I was wrong about you, wasn't I?  Jasmine,
    show this merchant's boot licker the door!
  225: You know the story!  I knew there was something special about you.  Ah, me
    granddad told that one a long time ago.  Now there was a thief!  But enough of
    that.  Anything else you need to ask?
  226: Other than the missing caravans, not much.  Oh, wait.  One of my lads came
    back yesterday all a-glow with a touch of radiation poisoning.  Nasty business.  Probably
    tip-toed a bit too close to the old Hot Spot.
  227: We steal from the rich, plain and simple.  We give about, oh, ten to twenty
    percent to the poor folks over in Old Town.  The Circle keeps twenty, which leaves
    the rest for the thief.  Not a bad deal all round.
  228: We're a bunch of crooks!  What did you think we were, a bunch of cooks?
  229: You could check with the merchants, although your time would be better spent
    sizing them up for some night removal work.  While I think it's absolute bunk,
    ask around about the Death Claw.  Or even follow a caravan out, if you've totally
    lost your mind.
  230: Well, how the bloody hell should I know?  Do I look like a merchant?
  231: Couple of ground rules.  One, don't ever get caught, and two, never, ever steal
    from the Circle.  Put it down.
  232: You just don't have the hang of this, do you?  Jasmine, the door for our foolish
    friend and don't let me see that face again.
  233: I don't think you quite understand.  Save it for the merchants, yes?
  234: What the bloody hell are you doing in here?  Get out!
  235: You see, it's like I said...
  236: Well, as I said...
  237: Are you just thick?  I told you...
  238: Which are you, deaf or stupid?  Like I said...
  239: It's no fun repeating myself.
  240: Ugh!  It's no use.  Obviously no amount of pounding can possibly get that information
    into your thick skull.
  241: No.  Decker's a slick one.  He's got the whole town in his pocket, he does.  He
    gives his 'protection' to the merchants, all the while pitting them against each
    other.  Not someone you want to mess with, but he can usually be found in the
    Maltese Falcon.
  242: He's a gun dealer up in the north part of Old Town.  Damn dangerous bloke,
    some of his hardware's a bit too lethal.
  243: Not too fond of us actually.
  244: Harold?  He's a good enough sort, for being a ghoul an all.  Lives on the south
    side.
  245: Decker's right hand man, definitely not one to mess with.  You can usually
    find him at the Maltese Falcon.
  246: Them.  Sitting high and mighty in their Water Tower south of downtown, charging
    all us decent folks for any drop of water that springs from the ground.  They
    should all be bloody shot, they should.
  247: They have a little general shop downtown.  Can't trust'em, though.  Hiding
    in their bloody warehouse most of the time.  They do sell some mean chems and
    medkits, though.  A lot cheaper than the stupid Children of the Cathedral, I can
    tell you that.
  248: The closest thing to decent of all the three caravans.  Only missed it by a
    few miles.
  249: Criminals.  Absolute criminals.  They're squeezing the life out of the town.  The
    Far Go Traders, the Crimson Caravan, and the worst of the bunch, the Water Merchants.  You
    can have the lot.
  250: It's down in the middle of town.
  251: Not much to tell, really.  Nighttime, scare your children stories about a beastie
    living up north and feeding on the flesh of bad little children everywhere.
  252: Seems like every day another one turns up missing.  People are afraid to leave
    town without protection.  Some even blame it on the Death Claw.
  253: About three years ago, one of the merchants went way down south looking for
    other towns.  He came back all hair and teeth falling out, babbling about some
    huge span of radiation.  Who knows, maybe something special down there before
    the war.
  254: Most of the poor who work for the merchants live here, in buildings so thin
    they don't block the sun.  Meanwhile, those rich bastards are comfortable in their
    nice homes over in the Heights.  Makes me ill.
  255: Fancy buildings.  Bought with the blood of the poor.
  256: You can always find Bob in the direct center of the Merchant's Market.  He'll
    probably be selling those Iguana Bits of his till he keels over dead.
  257: Now there's a scary bunch.  They strut around all day talking about their Night
    God, as if he's the next best thing since merchant pockets with holes.  They can
    heal you up pretty cheap.  I'll give'em that.  You can find'em in that hospital
    of theirs downtown.
  258: Oh, another bunch of wackos.  They sit up in their big black fortress to the
    north, just waiting for another war.
  259: Need to be a bit careful there.  The Rippers and the Blades like to carve you
    up just for fun.  While the town there, Adytum, just tries to stay alive.  If
    you find yourself traipsing around there and happen on the Blades, make sure to
    say cheers to Razor for me.  Thinking of her brings back memories, it does.
  260: They're the scrapheads down in the Boneyard.  They've been fighting for years,
    and they don't even know what for anymore.  Bloody stupid it is.
  261: Oh, what a woman!  She used to be a thief here, until she decided to move down
    south to the Boneyard.  Last I heard she joined up with the Blades.  Ah, well,
    brains weren't her strongest part.
  262: Hmm, I haven't the foggiest.
  263: I really don't know.
  264: Hmm.  Haven't a clue actually.
  265: Well, [Derisive sound], how did a total moron, such as yourself, get past my
    defenses?  Sorry, no idiot savants allowed, we like good conversation here.  Jasmine,
    show our drooling friend the door please.
  266: Talk to Jasmine and she'll fill you in on the details.
  267: Loxley looks too busy to talk.
  268: Jasmine will give you your reward.
  980: Hmm, I haven't the foggiest.
  981: I really don't know.
  982: Hmm.  Haven't a clue actually.
  983: Well, [Derisive sound], how did a total moron, such as yourself, get past my
    defenses?  Sorry, no idiot savants allowed, we like good conversation here.  Jasmine,

    probably be selling those Iguana Bits of his till he keels over dead.
  1116: Now there's a scary bunch.  They strut around all day talking about their
    Night God, as if he's the next best thing since merchant pockets with holes.  They
    can heal you up pretty cheap.  I'll give'em that.  You can find'em in that hospital
    of theirs downtown.
  1117: Oh, another bunch of wackos.  They sit up in their big black fortress to the
    north, just waiting for another war.
  1118: Need to be a bit careful there.  The Rippers and the Blades like to carve
    you up just for fun.  While the town there, Adytum, just tries to stay alive.  If
    you find yourself traipsing around there and happen on the Blades, make sure to
    say cheers to Razor for me.  Thinking of her brings back memories, it does.
  1119: They're the scrapheads down in the Boneyard.  They've been fighting for years,
    and they don't even know what for anymore.  Bloody stupid it is.
  1120: Oh, what a woman!  She used to be a thief here, until she decided to move
    down south to the Boneyard.  Last I heard she joined up with the Blades.  Ah,
    well, brains weren't her strongest part.
  1121: Them.  Sitting high and mighty in their Water Tower south of downtown, charging
    all us decent folks for any drop of water that springs from the ground.  They
    should all be bloody shot, they should.
  1122: About three years ago, one of the merchants went way down south looking for
    other towns.  He came back all hair and teeth falling out, babbling about some
    huge span of radiation.  Who knows, maybe something special down there before
    the war.

  1129: Criminals.  Absolute criminals.  They're squeezing the life out of the town.  The
    Far Go Traders, the Crimson Caravan, and the worst of the bunch, the Water Merchants.  You
    can have the lot.
  1130: Not much to tell, really.  Nighttime, scare your children stories about a
    beastie living up north and feeding on the flesh of bad little children everywhere.

  1133: Most of the poor who work for the merchants live here, in buildings so thin
    they don't block the sun.  Meanwhile, those rich bastards are comfortable in their
    nice homes over in the Heights.  Makes me ill.

    So you signed up.  Good to hear it.  So ya know, we leave just about every ten days. That's

    we go out often and you ain't\n gonna lose your life that easy.  But you get that

  116: Yaya.
  117: Tae?
  118: Alrighty.  Not a problem.  Just let me know if you change your mind.
  119: Would you just make up your mind?
  120: Come back by if you end up looking for something to do.  That's the 8st, 18th,
    and 28th. Bye.
  121: Uh, it ain't gonna work if you can't tell your right foot from your left.  Sorry
    big guy.
  122: Head on back when your feeling better.
  123: Man, you don't seem to be doing well.   You should get something in your stomach,
    just stay clar of Bob's.
  124: Get on out of here!
  125: Couldn't just leave my stuff alone, could you?  Why did you do it?
  126: Cuz I'm a mean green moth'a from outer space, and I'm... 'bad'!
  127: I didn't want to, but I'm starving and I have kids to feed.
  128: 'I''ll carve your heart out with a spoon! '

    So you just spit in my face huh?  I guess the only way to get this through your thick skull, is to remove it
     from that neck of yours.
  132: Fine, but that don't make it right.  You still are gonna have to get out of
    here.
  133: You think I'd believe that crap?  Guards!
  134: |-
    Maybe putting you in the tank will give you a better set of manners.  Are you gonna come quietly, or are
     we going to have to do this the hard way?
  135: I'll see you in hell!
  136: Yes.  I'm sorry.
  137: So you're a tough guy, huh?  Just lookin' for another fight?
  138: If you don't get out of here, I'm gonna call the cops!
  139: Guards! Police!
  140: I think you should leave..
  141: Sorry, but I ain't gonna offer you a job.
  142: I'd love to give you a job, but it's just not gonna happen.
  143: Leave.
  144: Pretty cute, but I'm not really into your kind.
  145: Well OK then! It'll pay 400 hubbucks. Which route would you prefer?

  156: |-
    Not sure what happened, but the whole caravan was lost.  Funny thing for something like that to happen, and
     for you to be the only one left standing?  Things don't generally fall that way.  I just don't think I can hire you
     anymore because of it.  I'm sure you understand why.
  157: Junktown
  158: 'LA Boneyard '
  159: Um, not right now. Maybe another time.
  160: Good to hear, I'll round up the rest of the crew.
  161: Great.
  162: Get on out of here.  Good luck!
  163: Try to avoid trouble, don't go lookin' for it.
  164: You be careful out there, the Boneyard ain't the safest of places..
  165: That's good. Those black walkways are really strange, but they're great to
    travel on.
  166: They definitely got a bad element out that way.  I'd watch who you deal with
    while down that way.
  167: Great.  Junktown ain't a bad place.
  168: Oh, and stop on by Killain, and tell him 'Hi" for me.  Man, the times we used
    to have on the caravans.
  169: Hear some odd doctor is out that way.  Deals in the dead, so they say.
  170: What in the hell were you thinkin leaving that caravan.  It came back safe,
    but that was pure damn luck.
  171: Can I have another chance?
  172: Nothing.
  173: I don't give a crap!
  174: Ig wa neeka rooola?

  176: You screwed it up again.  You just can't seem to handle this line of work.
  177: Why should I?
  178: You shouldn't.
  179: Because I'm going to put a hole through your head if you don't.
  180: I had better things to do than hang around some dumb caravan.
  181: I didn't know I wasn't allowed to leave. Everything seemed okay.

  183: I'm sorry you feel that way.
  184: |-
    Surprisin' that you ain't done this before.  Since that's the case, it ain't gonna harm anyone if I give you

  106: You're welcome. Bye.
  107: Uh.
  108: |-
    You haven't heard of us? I'm really surprised. You must not leave the Hub very often. You
     should get out more. We're northwest of here, on the west side of the mountain range.

    I really appreciate you helping me, but why are you trying to lie to me? Do you not think

  112: You obviously don't know what you're talking about.

     okay. I'm sure he's worried. Bye, and take care.
  114: |-
    Oh, I'll be fine now, thanks. I have some friends here that I can stay with while I regain my
     strength. I'll try to send word to the Brotherhood to let them know that I am safe now, thanks to you. Bye
  115: |-
    How… Oh, I'm sorry. You must have passed that "test" the Elders made up. I completely forgot
     about that. Well, my thanks goes even deeper. I'm glad you never gave up. My life could have been in jeopardy at any moment. It must have taken you a while to hunt me down. This city is huge. The obstacles you must have overcome.
  116: Well, you know… I'm just that good.
  117: Actually, it was quite easy. Talus knew where you went.
  118: Just lucky I guess.
  119: Well, you're welcome. I'm just glad I found you.
  120: Oh… Well, I'm still very grateful.
  121: I guess so. that was some fine handy work you did.
  122: Well, I'm glad I could help.
  123: Are you going to be okay?
  124: |-
    Well, thanks again. I am going to stay with some friend of mine until I regain my strength. By the
     way, I'd watch it around here. I heard my hosts talking about some Thieves' Circle. I guess we're close to
     their territory or something. I think that might be why they were talking about moving to a different
     location. Bye.
  125: |-
    Well, I'm glad your luck held out. I've heard some bad things about Old Town. The skags are creepy, I
     think it's something else.
  126: Whatever you say. I'm just grateful to be free again. I don't take well to
    torture.
  127: No, really, Talus sent me.
  128: Well, I'm glad i could help.
  129: Are you going to be okay?
  130: Maybe not. I've been having trouble remembering things. I think it was something
    they fed me.
  131: No, really, Talus sent me.
  132: Well, I'm glad I could help.
  133: Are you going to be okay?

  109: Are you aiming that at me?
  110: I've heard of you. Watch it.
  111: We'll be keeping an eye on you.
  112: No fighting in our town, tough guy.
  113: We don't like baby killers!
  114: Lay a hand on a kid and we'll hunt you down.
  115: I hate people like you.
  116: Don't call for help if you're in trouble.
  117: Hey, thanks for doing our work for us.
  118: We don't allow kill'n here, even if it is justified.
  119: If you're the one that killed the Deathclaw . . . thank you.
  120: Keep your nose clean while you're in our city.
  121: I would keep clear of Decker if I was you.
  122: Enjoy your stay.
  123: Welcome to the Hub!
  124: Greetings, stranger.
  125: Visit the Maltese Falcon for refreshing drinks.
  126: Follow the main road if you're looking for the market.
  127: Keep moving.
  128: Move along. Move along.
  129: We're here to Prevent and Survey.
  130: Keep that weapon under control while you're in our city.
  131: Don't you get into any fights with that.
  132: I'd recommend putting your weapon away.
  133: You should put that away . . . your weapon, that is.
  134: Welcome Paladin, it's been a while.
  135: You're that rowdy one. No more fighting okay?
  136: You better not start another fight!
  137: It's you . . . keep that temper of yours under control.
  138: The Far Go Traders got wiped out. I can't believe it.
  139: The Water Merchants are gone. What a relief.
  140: The Crimson Caravan has been destroyed.
  141: Did you hear? The Underground has finally been wiped out!
  142: Decker's dead!
  143: The Decker problem has finally been solved.
  144: Watch your back -- this isn't a safe place.
  145: Watch your scripts, guy.
  146: Watch your scripts, lady.
  147: Old Harold's good for telling tales.
  148: You shouldn't be here, it's not safe.
  149: Old Town's really fallen apart.
  150: This place smells.
  151: We should tear this whole area down.
  152: I know that damn thieves circle is around here somewhere.
  153: Poor Harold -- he's had a rough life.
  154: Keep your nose clean.
  155: Hey.  I know you.  No more fighting, okay?
  156: You'd better not be thinking of starting another fight!
  157: If we catch you fighting again, you're going in!
  158: Did you hear? The Far Go Traders got wiped out.
  159: The Water Merchants are history. That's a blessing.
  160: Someone killed off the Crimson Caravan.
  161: Did you hear? The Underground has finally been wiped out!
  162: Decker's dead!
  163: This town would be safer with Decker out of the picture.
MAXSON:
  100: You see General Maxson.
  101: What's the Brotherhood really about?
  102: I'll bet you know a lot of the history behind the Brotherhood.
  103: Heard any good rumors?
  104: I have some information to report.
  105: That's all. Thanks.
  106: |-
    Hello, youngster. Cabbot said you wanted to talk. Look I'm uh . . .
     I'm pretty stacked up right now, so I'll uh . . . I'll help you out as long
     as you don't start flappin' your gums too much. You know, outsiders are like that,
     always jawin' . . . Hehehe. Kinda like me, huh?
  107: Outsiders? What do you mean by that?
  108: How 'bout a few questions then?
  109: |-
    I can't. I just moderate these endless damn meetings. There's four Elders,
     and me, you see? I break up fights and tie votes. Now, if all four vote to pick our
     noses while an army rolls in here and kicks our collective butt, there's not a helluva
     lot I can do about it.
  110: Oh, well.
  111: That stinks. Why don't you do something?
  112: Tradition. It's hard to change our ways. Now, maybe if the Elders had some
    real info, they'd get off their brains and do something.
  113: "An Initiate not born here. You're the first Outsider we've let join in\n a
    long, long time. Well, near on twenty years now. "
  114: Why me?
  115: I'm flattered. How about some of those questions now?
  116: |-
    Because we need to do something. An army's gatherin', Hub-caravans are
     disappearin', and our scouts sure as hell ain't gettin' the job done.
     So the Elders actually did something once and figured the right
     Outsider might have something to offer. That Outsider is you... We hope.
  117: What army?
  118: What about these missing caravans?
  119: Hmm. I guess there are some more things I need to ask then.
  120: What's the problem with the scouts?
  121: I have some info you might want.
  122: |-
    When we heard about the missing caravans, we sent out a few
     scouts east and the north. The ones who went north never returned. One came
     back from the east. He talked about a score of strange beings, all muscle
     with burnin' eyes. The Elder's aren't doin' squat, but I'm getting ready
     just the same.
  123: Twenty isn't an army. Why are you worried?
  124: Sounds like your guy baked in the sun too long.
  125: I'll do what I can.
  126: Did he say where to the east?
  127: I have some info you might want.
  128: |-
    They may or may not be good scouts, but don't question
     the truthfulness of my men. We can revoke your Initiate status at any time.
  129: Sounds like you need me more than I need you.
  130: Sorry.
  131: 'That''s it. I warned the Elders that bringin'' in an Outsider could be trouble.
    (shouting aside) Guards! There''s an Initiate here who needs some quiet time to
    discover some manners. '
  132: 'You''re an Outsider, but I expect you to learn our ways. I''ll be watching.
    Now, ask your questions. '
  133: 'Good. Anything else you need to ask? '
  134: Deep in the mountains. He couldn't be more specific.
  135: Too bad. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  136: What about to the north?
  137: 'Go ahead. '
  138: Yeah, Fire away.
  139: Sure.
  140: Shoot.
  141: |-
    I got a gut feeling there's a small force in the east and
     a much bigger one in the north. The Elders are collecting dust because
     none of the scouts returned from the north. I can't do anything but watch.
  142: Well, I'll do what I can.
  143: Why don't you do something?
  144: I think I'm in a bit over my head. Count me out.
  145: I have some info on that.
  146: "Well the Merchants from the Hub told us a bunch of caravans\n disappeared
    on their way up north. I think there's an army in the mountains,\n but the Elders,
    well, they don't want to act until they're sure. "
  147: Where did they disappear?
  148: Aren't you the High Elder? Why don't you do something?
  149: Didn't you do anything?
  150: I have some info on that.
  151: |-
    The word I got was that the caravans disappeared around the
     southern tip of the mountains to the east. I imagine the Hub merchants can probably
     tell you more.
  152: Thanks. I've got some more questions, if that's okay.
  153: Thanks. I'll talk to you later.
  154: I have some info on that.
  155: See you around, Initiate. You're not so bad...for an Outsider.
  156: Goodbye, Initiate.
  157: Goodbye!
  158: 'I grew up too isolated here. Can you imagine spending your whole life inside
    one small place, then having to go out into the world? '
  159: Well, as a matter a fact . . .
  160: I guess I'm destined to be your scout, then.
  161: So because they didn't get out, I get to do your dirty work. Forget it.
  162: 'Then you understand the problem. To survive, we need someone who knows the
    outside. Like you. '
  163: Ok, I'll do it.
  164: I've got my own problems. I pass.
  165: |-
    Well . . . with what I guess is coming, we don't have time for anyone
     who's gonna . . . not contribute. Now, you either work with us, or you take a hike.
  166: Well, if you put it that way, I'm in.
  167: Looks like a nice day for a stroll.
  168: 'Your choice. Hope you can live with it. '
  169: |-
    What? It's who we are and what we live for. It's ideals. As you spend
     more time with us, hopefully, you'll understand.
  170: Yeah, but what do you actually do?
  171: I'm not too sure about this.
  172: Our main goal is to survive. The Scribes copy old plans for weapons or design
    new ones, and the Knights make the guns from 'em. Most guns come from us.
  173: You trade the weapons to the Hub?
  174: That's all you do?
  175: Makes sense. There's a couple of other things I need to ask.
  176: That's the way we get our supplies.
  177: Okay, I get it. There's a couple of other things I need to ask.
  178: Okay. I need to get going now, though.
  179: Guess I'm not too sure about this.
  180: All? It's damn important. It's critical to our survival.
  181: Whatever. I need to ask a few more questions.
  182: Yeah, well, it's stupid.
  183: Ok, thanks. I really should be going now, though.
  184: Then you need to get sure. Because being unsure is bound to get you killed.
  185: The more I know, the more sure I'll be.
  186: 'Look I don''t have time for a story that long right now. Here. All of us grew
    up on this. '
  187: 'There''s rumors concerning the missing caravans in the Hub, as well as the
    strange army brewing in the eastern mountains. '
  188: Ok.
  189: What army?
  190: What about these missing caravans?
  191: I have some info on that.
  192: 'I don''t take stock in rumors. '
  193: 'Ahh . . . Hello again, Initiate. Are things going well? '
  194: Pretty good. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  195: Well, actually, it sucks.
  196: Yes, thanks, but I gotta go.
  197: 'I''m sorry we''re not what you''re used to but you could show a little self-discipline. '
  198: Sorry. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  199: Why? This place is a joke?
  200: I have to get going. Bye.
  201: 'What the hell do you want now? '
  202: I want to know why an idiot is in charge here.
  203: I need to ask a few more questions.
  204: Never mind, thanks.
  205: 'Whaddya got? '
  206: Sorry, I didn't really have anything.
  207: The Hub caravans are being taken by huge, green mutants. They're gathering
    an army.
  208: There's a large army to the north controlled by someone called the Master.
  209: |-
    You've seen 'em? This might actually get the Elders to do something.
     I'm gonna get on this, thanks!
  210: 'Uh . . . What''s he plan to do with this . . . army of his? '
  211: He plans to take over the Brotherhood, the Hub, Junktown . . . everyone.
  212: How much you paying for this information?
  213: Finally! Well this'll get the Elders  off their butts. We'll fortify the Fortress
    and surprise those damn mutants.
  214: No! You don't understand. They are turning people into mutants and adding them
    to their army.
  215: Okay.
  216: So?
  217: So, by the time they get here, they'll be unstoppable. And they have advanced
    weapons, like yours. You don't stand a chance.
  218: Well, okay. Maybe digging in is the right thing.
  219: So what's your alternative?
  220: Help me attack the Master's base. I know where it is.
  221: Hmmm. Not a bad plan. Tell you what, let me go try and beat it into the Elders.
    No guarantees, but I'll try.
  222: Then get out. I have work to do.
  223: Pretty interesting set of priorities and loyalties you got there.
  224: Loyal to me. 500 in Hub script. Take it or leave it.
  225: Oh . . . yeah. Okay, I'll tell you. He plans to take over everyone and everything.
  226: I'll take it. We need the information to save lives.
  227: Pretty simple. He's changing humans into mutants and he's got advanced weapons.
    He plans to take over everything.
  228: Well, if he does, hope you find a place to use your scripts.
  229: |-
    Well, how about nothing! Guards, kick this fool out. By God!
     We'll defend the Brotherhood without your damn help.
  230: What do you think you're doing? Put that down. Put it down now!
  231: That's it. Guards! Take this idiot away!
  232: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold on now. Stop that. Stop it right now!
  233: Like I said...
  234: I said...
  235: I am not in the habit of repeating myself. So open your ears.
  236: Look I told ya' already. It's not my fault if you didn't get it.
  237: That's where you are. You want the long version, go talk to Vree.
  238: Mathia's my assistant.
  239: Oh, he's a good kid, even if he does want to be a Scribe.
  240: 'Vree''s the head Scribe.  She''s usually in the Library, she always likes
    to talk. '
  241: We keep weapon specs and history there.
  242: Rhombo's been here a long time. A bit stiff, but a helluva soldier.
  243: Hehehe. A fine, handsome, upstanding man. The High Elder position is to mediate
    the meetings between the Elders. You see, two years ago I got talked into it.
    If I'd of known then...
  244: Well you see there's four of them and that's about all they can ever agree
    on. They can't even agree if they want to piss, much less pick a pot to piss in.
  245: Well that's what you are. Initiates train and learn to become knights or scribes.
  246: |-
    Well, Scribes copy down the weapon specs. We've got information all the way back to
     my granddad. Sometimes a scribe comes up with a new idea for a weapon. Hehehe. Doesn't happen too often.
     They all answer to Vree.
  247: The Knights make the weapons. And when he's good enough, a Knight can advance
    to become a Paladin and then an Elder and so forth. Right now Rhombus is the head
    of the Knights.
  248: Paladins are in charge of all security and outside activities. I remember tradin'
    with the Hub, goin' on scouting missions for the Elders. Ah man, those ware a
    good times.
  249: The Hub's down to the southeast. They trade us food and things for the weapons
    we make here. Now if you're ever down there, you talk to Butch Harris.
  250: Butch is the head of the Far Go Traders. He's a little slimy, but he's not
    a total waste. Unlike those Water Merchants. Bunch of damn vultures, all of 'em.
  251: 'They''re the main ones we trade with. Not totally trustworthy, but not as
    bad as the others. '
  252: You can't trust them. A few years ago, they offered us Water for a huge stockpile
    of weapons. We told them no, and you know what they did? Sent in thieves to steal
    the weapons! We caught 'em, but the Elders voted down going to the Hub to teach
    the merchants a lesson.
  253: Holo discs? Hmm? I haven't seen those in a while.
  254: Vree has it someplace in the Library.
  255: Roger Maxson huh? Well he led our people here in the great Exodus, started
    the Brotherhood from scratch. Quite a leader.
  256: Well that was when my granddad, Roger Maxson, led his soldiers here and started
    the Brotherhood. He never mentioned where they came from, but it  doesn't really
    matter, 'cause...well, this is our home now.
  257: 'Well I believe there''s an army massing to the north and in the mountains
    to the east, but I don''t have any way to prove it. The Elders, they won''t even
    listen. '
  258: A bunch of religious whackos, if you ask me. I think their main church is in
    the Boneyard.
  259: Well I don't know a lot. There's a bunch of gangs around there, as well as
    Adytum and the Children of the Cathedral. Not much else. It's pretty damn desolate.
  260: Well, there's not much to tell. I never ran into any of them. I've heard they're
    a problem for the people of Adytum, though.
  261: That's a settlement down in the Boneyard. I went there...oh...a long time ago.
    I was on a scouting mission for the Elders.
  262: Oh. Just another stupid rumor. Some people say it's a huge fanged monster and
    others say it's a vampire.
  263: Oh, I don't know anything about that.
  264: What was that? No. I don't believe I've ever heard of it.
  265: Hell if I know.
  266: Surprised to see me? And let you have all the fun?
  267: How did you convince the Elders?
  268: Oh wasn't hard at all.  I just calmly explained the situation. And bingo here
    we are. Lead on, my friend.
  269: What are you doing in here? This is for Elders.
  270: Sorry, I'll just leave.
  271: I don't care, I'm staying.
  272: Good, now shut the door on the way out.
  273: I'm telling you, Do not interfere.
  274: Ha! You forget. I used to teach this stuff.
  275: Contrary to opinion, we don't want soldiers will no brains whatsoever.
  276: Well, I suggest you talk to my assistant, Mathia, about that.
  300: |-
    Maybe you can tell me? Everyone here seems to be on edge. It's like
     you are getting ready to go to war, but no one knows with who.
  301: Do you have any clues as to what's behind the disappearance of the caravans?
  302: I'll go scout out the area to the north and then report what I find.
  303: For 500 caps, I'll check out what's going on up there.
  304: For 1000 caps, I'll check out what's going on up north.
  305: I'm not sure if I want to get involved right now.
  306: Would it be possible for me to get a hold of some better weapons?
  307: Just a few questions first.
  308: No, I'll see you after I find out what's going on up there.
  309: Ok, bye
  310: How do you know that your scouts didn't desert?
  311: |-
    I believe I have ran into these creatures you are describing. They are not to be
     taken lightly.
  312: Please forgive me. What do you think is the cause of the disappearance?
  313: Go ahead. Revoke it. See if I care.
  314: Sorry, but it would be too risky for me to go up there right now.
  315: Alright, I'll go, but can I get some better weapons first?
  316: Ok, I'll do it for 1000 caps.
  317: Take it or leave it.
  318: Nevermind.
  319: Ok, Ok, I'll do it for free.
  320: Very well, I'll see you when I get back.
  321: |-
    I have found proof that it is this army which is causing that disappearance
     of the caravans. It is an army of mutants. You have good reason to be worried. They look very
     formidable.
  322: It's apparent that someone needs to go up there and check it out.
  323: |-
    It's going to take more than a "gut feeling" to get me to risk my life
     by going up there.
  324: I consider my life to be a fairly important priority.
  325: I just don't think I am ready for the task.
  326: I'm loyal to only one person.
  327: I can.
  328: Duh?
  329: |-
    Why does it seem that everyone here is on edge?  Everyone here seems to be on edge. It's like
     you are getting ready to go to war, but no one knows with who.
  330: |-
    I need to talk to you about the disappearance of the caravans. Do you have
     any insight on the matter.
  331: Nevermind.
  332: I need to ask you some questions.
  333: Duh?
  334: I have some information on the area north of here.
  335: Can I ask you some questions?
  336: Nevermind.
  337: Sorry, I didn't really have anything.
  338: I saw their base. It's crawling with mutants.
  339: I saw the mutant base to the north. They follow a leader they call the Master.
  340: You can't play defense on this one Maxson.
  341: |-
    Well, it's obvious something needs to be done. It would be best if we attack the
     mutants before they attack us. We're going to need the Elders on our side for this one.
  342: |-
    I'm not quite sure what we should do about it right now. Let
     me gather some more information, and I'll get back to you.
  343: He plans to take over any human settlements he can.
  344: What can you tell me about the Brotherhood's history?
  345: What is the Brotherhood's main purpose?
  346: Who are the Elders?
  347: Do you know anything about the Deathclaw?
  348: Nevermind.
  349: Can I ask you another question?
  350: Thank you.
  351: 'You gain '
  352: " experience points for scouting the Northern area."
  353: "An Initiate not born here. You're the first Outsider we've let join in\n a

    I've been to the Mutant base in the north. Let's just say they are no longer a
     threat.
  980: Oh, I don't know anything about that.

    the meetings between the Elders. You see, two years ago I got talked into it.
    If I'd of known then...
  1107: Well you see there's four of them and that's about all they can ever agree
    on. They can't even agree if they want to piss, much less pick a pot to piss in.
  1108: Well that's what you are. Initiates train and learn to become knights or scribes.
  1109: |-
    Well, Scribes copy down the weapon specs. We've got information all the way back to
     my granddad. Sometimes a scribe comes up with a new idea for a weapon. Hehehe. Doesn't happen too often.
     They all answer to Vree.
  1110: The Knights make the weapons. And when he's good enough, a Knight can advance
    to become a Paladin and then an Elder and so forth. Right now Rhombus is the head
    of the Knights.
  1111: Paladins are in charge of all security and outside activities. I remember
    tradin' with the Hub, goin' on scouting missions for the Elders. Ah man, those
    ware a good times.
  1112: The Hub's down to the southeast. They trade us food and things for the weapons
    we make here. Now if you're ever down there, you talk to Butch Harris.
  1113: Butch is the head of the Far Go Traders. He's a little slimy, but he's not
    a total waste. Unlike those Water Merchants. Bunch of damn vultures, all of 'em.
  1114: 'They''re the main ones we trade with. Not totally trustworthy, but not as
    bad as the others. '
  1115: You want to hear about the Water Merchants. Hehehe, well you can't trust them.
    A few years ago, they offered us Water for a huge stockpile of weapons. We told
    them no, and you know what they did? Sent in thieves to steal the weapons! We
    caught 'em, but the Elders voted down going to the Hub to teach the merchants
    a lesson.
  1116: Holo discs? Hmm? I haven't seen those in a while.
  1117: Vree has it someplace in the Library.
  1118: Roger Maxson huh? Well he led our people here in the great Exodus, started
    the Brotherhood from scratch. Quite a leader.
  1119: Well that was when my granddad, Roger Maxson, led his soldiers here and started
    the Brotherhood. He never mentioned where they came from, but it  doesn't really
    matter, 'cause...well, this is our home now.
  1120: 'Well I believe there''s an army massing to the north and in the mountains
    to the east, but I don''t have any way to prove it. The Elders, they won''t even
    listen. '
  1121: A bunch of religious whackos, if you ask me. I think their main church is
    in the Boneyard.
  1122: Well I don't know a lot. There's a bunch of gangs around there, as well as
    Adytum and the Children of the Cathedral. Not much else. It's pretty damn desolate.
  1123: Well, there's not much to tell. I never ran into any of them. I've heard they're
    a problem for the people of Adytum, though.
  1124: That's a settlement down in the Boneyard. I went there...oh...a long time
    ago. I was on a scouting mission for the Elders.
  1125: Oh. Just another stupid rumor. Some people say it's a huge fanged monster
    and others say it's a vampire.
  1126: Butch is the head of the Far Go Traders. He's a little slimy, but he's not
    a total waste. Unlike those Water Merchants. Bunch of damn vultures, all of 'em.
  1127: Roger Maxson huh? Well he led our people here in the great Exodus, started
    the Brotherhood from scratch. Quite a leader.
  1128: Well I don't know a lot. There's a bunch of gangs around there, as well as
    Adytum and the Children of the Cathedral. Not much else. It's pretty damn desolate.
  1129: Well I don't know a lot. There's a bunch of gangs around there, as well as
    Adytum and the Children of the Cathedral. Not much else. It's pretty damn desolate.
  1130: What was that? No. I don't believe I've ever heard of it.
  1131: Well that was when my granddad, Roger Maxson, led his soldiers here and started
    the Brotherhood. He never mentioned where they came from, but it  doesn't really
    matter, 'cause...well, this is our home now.
  1132: Butch is the head of the Far Go Traders. He's a little slimy, but he's not
    a total waste. Unlike those Water Merchants. Bunch of damn vultures, all of 'em.
  1133: Hell if I know.
GENKNIGH:
  100: You see a Knight.
  101: I wonder what the old turbine engines were really like.
  102: It would be great if we had a working automobile.
  103: |-
    Did you know man has been on the moon? Or I think that's what they
     said.
  104: I can't find the file I need.
  105: I'll be a Paladin someday.
  106: |-
    Talus is a skilled warrior. I would never want to have to go up
     against him.
  107: |-
    Thomas is the best fighter in the Brotherhood. I bet he could best
     Rhombus.
  108: |-
    I'd like to get my hands on those raiders. Show them what thieves
     deserve.
  109: That's it . . . what? Oh sorry. I can't talk right now.
  110: I wonder . . . huh? Oh, you made me lose my train of thought.
  111: I love working on new prototypes.
  112: |-
    When our supplies are limited, it can really be a challenge to find
     a way to use what we've got.
  113: I can't figure out why my last prototype didn't work.
  114: Sorry, can't talk right now.
  115: Vree's over there.
  116: Now where did I put that file . . .
  117: Where's that schematic?
  118: Well the computer says it should work; now what did I do wrong?
MUTANT3:
  100: It's some kind of huge super mutant creature! And it has a very large gun!
MBVATS:
  100: 'off'
  101: 'Time left:  '
  102: " seconds."
  103: This is where you would be considered dead.

  112: This is where you would be considered dead.
GLWBOX:
  100: This looks to be the footlocker of some guards.
  101: You pick the lock on the box.
  102: You failed to pick the lock on the lockbox.
  103: This item is useless on the lockbox.
  104: The box is locked.
  105: You pick the lock on the box.
  106: You failed to pick the lock on the box.
  107: This skill is useless on the box.
CRASHBOX:
  100: There's a sign on the fridge.
  101: 'The sign reads: "For tenants only".'
GAMBLER:
  100: You see a seedy-looking Mexican man with slick hair.
  101: You see Hernandez, the rascally gambler.
  102: |-
    Oye, muchacho, allow me to introduce myself. I am Hernandez,
     a man of mucho gusto! You look like you are new here. Please,
     allow me to be your informant to the casino.
  103: Can you tell me about the casino?
  104: No, thanks.
  105: Bloo?
  106: |-
    But of course! This fine establishment is run by
     the famous Gizmo. A true visionary and a very wealthy
     man.
  107: Thanks.
  108: You say Gizmo is a visionary. What's his vision?
  109: What are the odds like on the games here?
  110: |-
    My friend, I hate to impose, but perhaps you could assist me.
     I have developed a sure-fire system, because I have discovered
     how Gizmo runs his tables, but I do not have the caps to
     play.
  111: " [You get the feeling that he's trying to scam you.]"
  112: Perhaps you can spare a few caps? I guarantee success.
  113: Sure, sounds good.
  114: No, thanks.
  115: I think you're lying. You're trying to scam me.
  116: Sorry, mi amigo. Hey, let me show you a neat game . . .
  117: |-
    Thank you very much, mi amigo! In a few days I shall be able
     to pay you back, with interest. My system is slow, you see,
     it requires much patience, but it will most certainly reap
     great profits!
  118: |-
    Very well, but I guarantee success! If you want to get in
     on the riches just waiting, come back soon, or I will find
     another partner!
  119: |-
    My friend, I see you are a man of much taste, as well.
     Perhaps a simple game of dice?
  120: All right!
  121: No, thanks, I'd rather try something else.
  122: |-
    Gizmo had a dream of setting up a place where people
     could meet and enjoy themselves. He had the ambition to
     make it happen. The result is the casino you see here.
  123: |-
    He gives people a chance to shrug off their cares in the
     broken world outside. And he brings money into Junktown!
  124: Sounds like a good idea.
  125: |-
    Life's hard enough. I don't trust the motives of someone
     who would encourage people to lose their money.
  126: |-
    You obviously don't share Gizmo's brilliance. This place
     is a respite from the harshness of everyday life.
  127: |-
    Well, Gizmo runs a pretty good house, although the games are,
     how shall we say, rather weighted towards the house.
     It's not like his dealers cheat, though. But unless you have
     a system, like me, you will need to be very clever.
  128: Thanks.
  129: "[]"
  130: How is your system coming?
  131: Nothing, thanks.
  132: |-
    My system is developing slowly. I have living expenses
     and such, you know, but it is working!
  133: That's great!
  134: I think that you are a liar and a cheat. Where's my money?
  135: |-
    So, you think you have tumbled to me, eh? Well, you won't
     get anything from me!
  136: Buenos dias, my friend! What can I do for you today?
  137: Buenos dias, my friend! What can I do for you today?
GUIDO:
  100: You see Guido.
  101: I say you just use brute force. It don't take that much to bust a knee cap.
  102: |-
    Who cares about shock value? We ain't artists, we're professionals. Uh, Leone, someone's trying to talk to
     us. Aren't we supposed to kill them if they do that?
  103: I say you just use brute force. It don't take that much to bust a knee cap.
  104: I ain't paid to talk.
  105: Who cares about shock value? We ain't artists, we're professionals. Uh, Leone,
    someone's trying to talk to us. Aren't we supposed to kill them if they do that?

GOODSLOT:
  100: |-
    It's a slot machine with a picture of a nuclear explosion on the side.
     It costs $20 to play.
  101: You drop $20 in the slot machine and pull the greasy handle.
  102: DING! DING! DING!
  103: You get three nukes. Excellent! $
  104: " drops into the tray and you snatch it up."
  105: Ding! Ding! Ding!
  106: You get three bombs. Winner! $30 drops into the tray and you snatch it up.
  107: Aww shucks! You lose.
  108: You don't have enough money to play.
FORCECON:
  100: This looks like a control panel for a force field.
BVAIR:
  100: |-
    You notice that there is a wall locker on the east wall,
     just like in your own vault.
TERM:
  100: You see a highly advanced Brotherhood computer.
  101: You are denied access to this terminal.
  102: The lesson finishes in six hours. You feel exhausted.
  103: You've already absorbed as much as you can.
  200: You see a computer. You see some pieces that might be human flesh.
  201: |-
    You fiddle with the computer for a moment, but cannot get past the
     security system.
  202: This computer is functioning perfectly.
  203: You find an interesting data file on a secret base to the north-west.
  204: 'You gain '
  205: " experience points for hacking into this computer."
VANHAG:
  100: You see a Member of the Children of the Cathedral.
  101: I do not speak with heathen souls such as yourself.
  102: Your report, VanHagan.
  103: |-
    The Master is pleased with your progress, but his
     need is great and time is limited.
  104: |-
    The Master should know that raw material is limited.
     We cannot create our soldiers without more stock.
  105: |-
    He is aware of your problems. He is working on it,
     as we speak.
  106: |-
    Tell me of his plans. We will need to coordinate
     activities, if the Unity is to succeed.
  107: |-
    The Master has become aware of an undiscovered, and
     living, Vault. With that much raw material, we can
     create a great force. According to the prediction
     software, it will be the numbers we need to succeed.
  108: |-
    Excellent. This is most fortuitous. Are the inhabitants
     contaminated?
  109: |-
    Oh, this is the best part. If their representative is
     any example, they are clean. Pure-strain.
  110: |-
    Oh, this is most exciting. What Vault is it that we
     plunder?
  111: Vault-13. And we shall have them soon. Very soon.
  112: |-
    You gain 1000 experience points for overhearing the whole conversation
     about your Vault.
TYLIER:
  100: Security Station
  101: |-
    This terminal, 'Tylier', controls Special Forces Operations. Please
     present voice authorization.
  102: Nuna!
  103: Help me. Me got owwie.
  104: Let me in.
  105: 'I am '
  106: ". Let me pass."
  107: What do you do here?
  108: 'Voice not recognized. Security systems status: armed.'
  109: I am the security system for Blue Level. All systems armed.
  110: Can you disarm the systems?
  111: Why are the systems armed when the war has ended?
  112: Thank you.
  113: |-
    I have been programmed to keep the systems armed until
     authorized personnel have entered the correct voice code.
  114: Will you disarm the systems for me?
  115: Good bye.
  116: 'Voice override: Gamma Delta Delta. Disarm all systems.'
  117: You are not authorized. Access denied.
  118: Invalid code. Access denied.

    I have not received orders to do otherwise. Network access is

  126: 'Fine. Voice override: Sigma Alpha Delta. Disarm systems.'
  127: Good bye.
  128: Security systems are currently disarmed.
SDRESSER:
  100: This dresser looks well cared for.
  101: This dresser looks well cared for.
  102: All you see are some thread bare clothes here.
MICHAEL:
  100: You see Michael.
  101: Well, I guess that's what the problem was. You should see the Doctor, she's
    on level two.
  102: You're fine as far as I can tell.
  103: "The supply room is off limits my son. Only myself and two others have access
    to that room. If you need \nsomething, you need to talk to me about it."
  104: "The supply room is off limits ma'am. Only myself and two others have access
    to that room. If you need \nsomething, you need to talk to me about it."
  105: Didn't you hear me? I said that the rooms are off limits.
  106: Hello, Brother. How can I help you?
  107: Please excuse me for asking, but what do you do for our Brotherhood.
  108: What do you do around here?
  109: I've been injured. Can you heal me?
  110: Urak Chufar!
  111: I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you want. If you need supplies, you
    need to have authorization.
  112: Taga ma.
  113: Caroo!
  114: |-
    I still don't understand you. Maybe you need to see the Doctor
       She's on level two.
  115: You should see the Doctor. She's on level two.
  116: Oh, nothing quite as glorious as our Paladins. I just run the supply room,
    checking equipment and other supplies out to people.
  117: I was sent here by ... Bob. He wanted me to get him ... that new high tech
    weapon-thingy. He said to bring it right away.
  118: I'd like to check out something. How do I do that?
  119: Oh, that's nice. Bye.
  120: "[Failed Lie] Bob? Bob who? What are you talking about? What new high tech
    weapon-thingy? I need \nmore specifics than that, and you must have the who ever
    it is get me the proper authorization. \nI cannot give anything without authorization."
  121: "[Successful Lie] Oh, you mean the laser pistol? Okay, hold on a second please.
    I don't have any \nauthorization from a Bob to give anyone a laser. Oh, wait a
    second. I get it. Those girls downstairs \nthink they are really funny don't they.
    I wish they would stop bothering me."
  122: "Well, you know. They told me not to tell you, but it's just because they like
    you so much. I think one of them \nhas a crush on you."
  123: Sorry, I had no idea what they were up to. They told me to come up here and
    tell you this, and that you would get a big kick out of it.
  124: I'm sorry. It was a bad joke. I was just kidding around with you.
  125: "[Failed Lie] You're doing it again! Stop tormenting me! They are so cruel!
    I can't believe you would stoop to their \nlevel. Us guys are supposed to stick
    together."
  126: You're lying! You're in cahoots with them. How could you be so cruel?
  127: "[Successful Lie]  Really? You wouldn't be pulling my leg again would you?
    No, you seem like a good lad. They \nprobably forced you to do this. You know,
    I've caught Lara looking at me during Training. I bet it was her, right?"
  128: Yep, you got it. She's the one. Don't tell her I told you. She would kill me.
  129: No, I'm sorry. I was just messing with you. No one sent me here.
  130: You're doing it again! Stop tormenting me! You women are so cruel!
  131: "[Successful Lie]  Really? You wouldn't be pulling my leg again would you?
    No, you seem like a good lass. They \nprobably forced you to do this. You know,
    I've caught Lara looking at me during Training. I bet it was her, right?"
  132: Yep, you got it. She's the one. Don't tell her I told you. She would kill me.
  133: No, I'm sorry. I was just messing with you. No one sent me here.
  134: "Well, I don't know what to say. I've always sorta had a crush on here, but
    I didn't want to act, \nbecause I didn't know if she felt the same way or not.
    Next time I see her, I think I'll ask her out. \nMaybe I'll try and get on the
    same patrol as here and surprise her with a nice romantic dinner. Thanks \na lot.
    You have really made my day. Here, take these. You should be able to find some
    use for them. They're \npulse grenades. Very useful against robots. Hopefully,
    you'll never have to use them. Bye."
  135: That's not very nice of you. Why would you say something like that if it wasn't
    true? Some people!
  136: Oh. You've got a strange sense of humor. Well, don't bother me unless you have
    something to checkout.
  137: "Oh, those girls are always giving me a hard time. I don't know why they keep
    doing it. That Lara sure is \ncute though. I've liked her for quite some time.
    I knew her when she was younger. She was such a darling. \nNow she's older, and
    she treats me so terribly. I've never done anything to deserve this."
  138: "Well, maybe she likes you. Did you ever think about that? She just might not
    know how to approach you. You should ask her. \nIf you really do like her, what
    do you have to lose?"
  139: Maybe she likes you.
  140: Uh, yeah. Okay. Bye.
  141: "You know, you're right. What have I got to lose? The next time I see her,
    I think I will ask her out.\nMaybe I'll try and get on the same patrol as here
    and surprise her with a nice romantice dinner. Thanks \na lot. You have really
    made my day. Here, take these. You should be able to find a use for them. \nThey
    are dexterity boosters. Be careful with them, as they can cause cravings. Bye."
  142: "No, that's not likely. Women sure do confuse me sometimes. I can read and
    understand any new \nschematic they put in front of me; but when it comes to women,
    I'm at a total loss. Thanks anyways."
  143: "No, that's not likely. You women sure do confuse me sometimes. I can read
    and understand any new \nschematic they put in front of me; but when it comes
    to women, I'm at a total loss. Thanks anyways."
  144: You need to have the proper authorization. only specific people can give authorization
    to check out items from the supply room.
  145: Oh. Okay, thanks. Who do I need to talk to then?
  146: I have been given authorization to check something out. Could you check the
    terminal to see if it went through yet?
  147: Who can give me authorization?
  148: "Well, there are quite a few people actually; but Talus is the person you should
    probably talk to. You \nmight also want to check with Mathia, she might be able
    to help you, too."
  149: Where can I find Mathia?
  150: Where's Talus?
  151: Okay, thanks.
  152: |-
    Mathia is Maxon's assistant. She is technically the High Elder's assistant, but she works with all the
     other Elders. She is normally in the Elders' Rooms. That's located on the fourth floor.
  153: Okay. Where's Talus?
  154: Okay. Thanks. Bye.
  155: Why, he's in the training room to my left.
  156: Great. Now, could you also direct me to where I can find Mathia?
  157: How about Mathia.
  158: Thanks. Talk to you later.
  159: Yes, during the day she is normally in the Elders' Rooms. That's located on
    the fourth floor.
  160: Thank you. You have been very helpful.
  161: "Well, here's the chem you had authorization for. Be careful with that. They
    can cause cravings if you use \nthem too often. Detoxing and downtime is not much
    fun, but I guess they're pretty much the same thing. \nUse at your own risk. Is
    there anything else I can do for you?"
  162: No, that's it. Thanks.
  163: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  164: "Well, here's the chem you wanted. That's some handy stuff. I'm sure it will
    be useful. Did you need \nsomething else?"
  165: No, that's it. Thanks.
  166: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  167: Okay, I've got some of that. You never can have enough ammo right? Well, there
    you are. Anything else?
  168: No, that's it. Thanks.
  169: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  170: "Oh, these can really be dangerous. Just be sure you are far enough away when
    they go off. There \nyou are. Anything else?"
  171: "\"No, that's it. Thanks."
  172: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  173: Ah, nothing like a good weapon by your side. Anything else?
  174: No, that's it. Thanks.
  175: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  176: "A good defense is the best offense. Or was it the other way around? Well,
    it doesn't matter. Here's \nyour armor. Be sure to take care of it. I can't give
    out more than one set. Was there another item you needed?\""
  177: No, that's it. Thanks.
  178: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  179: Well, this can be useful in the right hands. Here you go. Anything else?
  180: No, that's it. Thanks.
  181: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  182: Oh, something else? Sorry, I must have missed it. Let me see.
  183: Hello, again. How are you doing today? How can I help you?
  184: Is there anything I can help you with? You seem to be awfully busy.
  185: I have something to pick up.
  186: Nothing, bye.
  187: Could you ever possibly help me? I don't think so. Get out of my way.
  188: Okay, let me see here.
  189: Ah, yes. You do have authorization to check something out.
  190: |-
    Well actually. Sophia has been in need of some Pulse grenades but I haven't had a chance to run them down to her yet.
     Do you think you could run them down for me?
  191: Sure. Hand them over.
  192: Sorry, I don't have time. Hope you can find someone else.
  193: What do I look like, your lackey?
  194: |-
    Okay, there you go. Sophia is one of the two Assistant Master Scribes for Vree.
     She is normally in the library on the third floor.
  195: Why haven't you delivered the items I gave you? Sophia is expecting them.
  196: I'm sorry. Could you tell me where she is again.
  197: I lost them. Can I have some more?
  198: I'm sorry, I lost track of time.
  199: Ha! You thought I would actually deliver it? You're dumber than you look!
  200: She is normally in the library on the third floor.
  201: Guards! We have a thief! Show him what we do to those that betray the Brotherhood.
  202: Guards! We have a thief! Show her what we do to those that betray the Brotherhood.
  203: Sorry, I'm not talking to the likes of you.
  204: Likely story. I knew I shouldn't have trusted someone like you.
  205: |-
    I can't believe you'd show your face around here again.
     I hope the grenades were useful, you're never getting anything from me again.
     I don't care who supposedly gives you authorization.
  206: |-
    Why hello again. Sophia says you delivered the grenades.
     That was very kind of you. She is working on a better version and needed to
     see if the circuitry was compatible.
  207: What do you want.
  208: Just give me what I have to pick up and I'll be out or your way.
  209: Nothing.
  210: Well fine. Let me just check and see if I have an order.
  211: Okay, you need some ammunition do you. Well what kind did you need.
  212: I don't know.
  213: 10mm Jacketed Hollow Point.
  214: 10mm Armor Piercing.
  215: 44 magnum Jacketed Hollow Point.
  216: 44 magnum Full Metal Jacket.
  217: 14mm Armor Piercing
  218: ".223 Full Metal Jacket."
  219: 5mm Jacketed Hollow Point.
  220: 5mm Armor Piercing.
  221: Shotgun shells.
  222: |-
    Well you need to find out what type of ammunition you need before
     I can give it to you. Just examine the weapon that you requested ammunition for.
     When you figure it out, just give me a holler.
  223: Ah a rocket launcher...nothing like a good weapon by your side. So, will that
    be it?
  224: No, that's it. Thanks.
  225: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  226: Ah yes, here is the fine pistol you're looking for. So, will that be it?
  227: No, that's it. Thanks.
  228: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  229: "A good defense is the best offense. Or was it the other way around? Well,
    it doesn't matter. Here's \nyour armor. Be sure to take care of it. I can't give
    out more than one set. Was there another item you needed?"
  230: No, that's it. Thanks.
  231: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  232: |-
    Hmmm...Powered Armor. Be sure to take care of it. I can't give
     out more than one set. Was there another item you needed?
  233: No, that's it. Thanks.
  234: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  235: Well, this can be useful in the right hands. Here you go. Anything else?
  236: No, that's it. Thanks.
  237: Yes, I have something else to pick up.
  240: I'm looking for a Systolic Motivator.
  241: Do you have the proper authorization?
  242: Yes. I was sent up here to get a Systolic Motivator.
  243: No I don't, but it is imperative that I get that part.
  244: Kyle sent me up to get the part.
  245: No. How do I get authorization?
  246: |-
    Let me look here. (he checks his terminal) Well I don't see
     a Request for a Systolic Motivator? You'll need to get the proper
     authorization.
  247: Now look! I don't want any trouble. Just give me the damn part.
  248: Come on? Please. I really need this part.
  249: OK. Sorry to bother you.
  250: |-
    You don't? Ordinance was suppose to send one down yesterday.
     Look, can you help me out? If I don't get this part it's gonna be
     my ass. I'm sure the form will be here later today.
  251: |-
    OK. Here you go. Just don't tell anyone that I gave this to you.
     Rhombus would have my head if he knew I had given the parts out without
     proper authorization.
  252: Thank you. Bye.
  253: |-
    I would give it to you if I could. But I can't. Not without
     proper authorization.
  254: |-
    You know Michael, you're probably one of the brightest guys
     I've talked to here. But I don't understand why you're giving me
     such a hard time. I really need that part.
  255: |-
    Oh.. Well. I guess I understand. I don't know what I'm going
     to do, though.
  256: Just give it to me.
  257: |-
    If you don't have authorization you can not get
     replacement parts.
  258: Come on? Please. I really need this part.
  259: OK. Sorry to bother you. Bye.
  260: Kyle? Is this about that old junked Power Armor?
  261: Yes.
  262: No.
  263: |-
    You can tell him that when he gets that unit back to its
     original glory, then and only then will he get the authorization
     he needs. Good Bye.
  264: |-
    You don't. First Kyle needs to see the Unit in need of repair.
     If he feels the repair is warranted he then puts in a parts request.
     Rhombus reviews the requests and determines which ones are viable.
     Go talk to Kyle. Bye.
  265: Goodbye.
  266: |-
    Oh...yeah, well Kyle sent me. Could you check your terminal
     one more time.
  267: But Rhombus sent me.
  268: |-
    Your not getting the part and that's final. I told you what
     you need to do and I'm not going to repeat myself.
VALTMEET:
  100: |-
    This is the Vault meeting room. This is a good
     gathering place for the Vault dwellers.
     Oddly, it does not hold your attention like it did in the past.
HUNTER:
  100: |-
    You see a burly bounty hunter with a button that
     reads, 'I'm Christopher and you're meat.'
  101: What do you want?
  102: A donut.
  103: What are you doing here?
  104: Just looking around.
  105: Nothing.
  106: We don't appreciate wise guys here. Buzz off.
  107: |-
    That joke wasn't even funny the first time. You're about
     to discover why I'm one of the most fearsome bounty hunters
     in the wasteland. And I won't even get paid for it.
  108: None of your business.
  109: Well, go poke around somewhere else.
  110: |-
    Did you know that there's a bounty of 1,500 caps on your head
     for killing children? Time to collect!

  1101: Those are the peace loving freaks who live near us.
  1102: |-
    A strange cult south of Adytum and the rest of the Boneyard. Nicole
     says that they are up to something.
  1103: An ultra-violent gang to our west.
  1104: A gang to the east. They use vibro-knives.
  1105: A gang that came from the Hub, and sells guns. They are north of here.
  1106: The Hub is a large city of traders and businesses, to the east.
  1107: Junktown is a small city just north of the Hub.
  1108: I can't help you with that.
  1109: She's the leader of the Followers.
  1110: |-
    This place is the Angel's Boneyard, the remnants of the old city of
     Los Angeles.
  1111: A gang that came from the Hub, and sells guns. They are north of here.
  1112: I can't help you with that.
MVAIRLOC:
  100: You see an airlock door.
  101: The door is locked electronically.
  102: The door is not locked.
  103: You manage to bypass the electronic lock.
  104: Your attempt to circumvent the electronic lock fails.
HWMHOST:
  100: You see a Hub guard.
  101: Can I help you?
  102: Yes.  Could you tell me where I am?
  103: Goodbye.
  104: Uhhhhhhh.  Huh huh.  Uhhhhh.  Huh.
  105: Man, you're dumber than a bag of hammers, aren't you?  Get outta' here
  106: You're in the south end of the Hub.  If you look around you'll find the Water
    Merchants and a small hospital.
  107: Who are the Water Merchants?
  108: A hospital?
  109: Thank you.  Bye.
  110: Those bastards.  They think they own the damn Hub just because they have control
    of the Water Tower.
  111: A hospital?
  112: Thank you.  Bye.
  113: The Children of the Cathedral run a small hospital here in the Hub.  They seem
    like a decent bunch.
  114: Who are the Water Merchants?
  115: Thank you.  Bye.
DECKGRD:
  100: You see one of Decker's guards.
  101: You need to talk to the boss.
  102: You'd better stay on our good side.
  103: We'll be watching you.
  104: Don't even touch your weapons.
  105: If you look at him wrong, you're dead.
  106: Watch it.
  107: I surrender!
  108: I never liked working for that guy Decker anyways.
  109: Now that Decker and Kane are gone, I'm gonna take over!
  110: You'd better be careful around the Hub from now on.  I'm watching you.
BVLAD:
  100: You begin climbing the ladder.
  101: |-
    You slip off the ladder and plummet into the darkness below.
     You land with a crash, but take no damage.
  102: "You slip off the ladder and plummet into\n the darkness below. You land with
    a crash and take "
  103: " damage."
  104: You fall off the ladder near the bottom.
SUPER:
  100: |-
    It's some kind of huge super mutant creature!
     And it has a very large gun!
  101: You're on Unity soil. I'd better take you in.
  102: Ok.
  103: I don't think so.
  104: Wahh?
BILLY:
  100: You see Billy.
  101: Hi there.
  102: Hi, what are you doing?
  103: Can I have a brahmin?
  104: Hi.  Uh, bye.
  105: Arg!
  106: Ta.
  107: |-
    Why would you want a brahmin? Do you have a caravan? Well, it doesn't matter. I only take care of
     them. Dan is the one that owns them; he won't sell them though.
  108: Why?
  109: I was just kidding.
  110: |-
    Cuz of all the missing caravans. He doesn't have any to spare, the caravans use most of them. The
     others are sold for food. Well, I better stop talking; Dan will get mad if he sees me talking to a stranger.
  111: Oh, okay.
  112: Nothing . . . I mean, I'm taking care of the brahmin.
  113: What's the spear for? Are they dangerous?
  114: What's a brahmin?
  115: |-
    What's a brahmin? You must be joking. Why they're one of the major
     food sources and forms of transportation around here. They haul the caravans.
     Dan says this is a really important job, but it's the Bone.
  116: Oh, I knew that!
  117: Dan's right. You are doing a great job.
  118: Yea, it looks that way. Have fun.
  119: Hey, you're one of those skags aren't you?
  120: Really? You think so? Gee, thanks.
  121: |-
    You're not from around here, are you? I'll give you one tip:
     Don't get caught stealing!
  122: Sure, thanks.
  123: I wouldn't dream of stealing. Stealing is wrong.
  124: |-
    Yea, I think I'm starting to agree with you. This job isn't so bad, really.
     It makes me feel good for some reason. Well, I've got to go before I get
     in trouble.
  125: Please don't hurt me or my brahmin.
  126: Don't hurt me!
  127: Stop it!
  128: Please leave me alone.
  129: You're scaring me.
  130: Hey what are you trying to do?  I don't have anything you'd want.
  131: Stop that!
  132: |-
    Dangerous? No, not really. They can give you a really nasty bite,
     but they're pretty cool. They fart and burp a lot. I don't know why.
  133: So what's the spear for?
  134: Okay, thanks.
  135: "Oh, they can be awfully stubborn when I want them to do something.  I just
    gently stick them to get\n them to move around . . .  plus I don't want to get
    too close; they sometimes kick. "
  136: |-
    Please don't talk to me. Dan is going to yell at me again.  He really gets pissed -  I mean - mad, when
     I'm not paying attention to what I'm doing.
  137: He's just trying to help. Work hard and I'm sure he'll be nicer.
  138: Here kid, take 50 bucks and get away from this jerk.
  139: Okay.
  140: Aaaaaarg!
  141: Rhu?
  142: Please don't, I'm already in enough trouble.
  143: I AM working hard!
  144: I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. He's just trying to help you.
  145: No you aren't, you lazy little skeev!
  146: 'Okay. '
  147: |-
    Yea, maybe you're right . . . actually, he seems pretty cool,
     but I wish he wouldn't yell at me so much.
  148: Yea, right.
  149: Up yours, you old fart!
  150: Up yours, you old hag!
  151: WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, mister!
  152: WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, ma'am!
  153: WOW! Thanks . . . Well? . . . You're just trying to get me in trouble again!
  154: Please don't talk to me, Dan is really mad.
  155: Don't worry. I had a talk with him, he'll try to be nicer to you.
  156: And he should be! You're a terrible kid!
  157: Wac.
  158: Hi!
  159: Those girls over there sure are dumb.
  160: Hi again.
  161: Brahmin are cool.
  162: Dan's taking me to the Falcon if I do a good job.
  163: Dan's going to take me on a caravan some day!
  164: I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.
  165: |-
    Really? Oh, okay. I hope you didn't hurt him. He's really not so bad.
     He just yells a lot.
  166: Hello again.
  167: What is it you do again?
  168: Can I have a brahmin?
  169: Just stopping by to see how things are going. Bye.
  170: Arg!
  171: Ta.
  172: I'd better get back to work.
  173: Those girls over there sure are dumb.
  174: Hi again.
  175: I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.
  176: Brahmin sure do shi . . . uh, poop a lot.
  177: I can't talk right now.
  178: I don't want to get in trouble.
NICOLE:
  100: You see Nicole.
  101: Tell me a little history behind the Followers.
  102: What do you worship?
  103: What's around here?
  104: I have some information for you.
  105: Greetings. Hey! We're very glad you could join us. We hope you have found our
    humble abode to your satisfaction.
  106: Thanks. Can you tell me more about what you worship here?
  107: "'Humble' is a good word. 'Dump' would be better."
  108: I have. Can I ask you a few questions?
  109: It's okay, I guess.
  110: Nuhh? Uh, nuh, nuh. Huh?
  111: We don't worship so much as follow a set of principles. We want to bring peace
    back to this wasteland. The world tends toward destruction, so we try to make
    a difference.
  112: How?
  113: We try to remind people why the Great War happened in the first place. And
    help insure it won't ever happen again.
  114: Have you been successful at all?
  115: Sounds like wishful thinking - not very realistic.
  116: We never give up hope. We never will, even though most live by the gun these
    days. And we are concerned with the Children of the Cathedral...
  117: What about them?
  118: They claim to want peace, like us. But anyone who disagrees with them just
    disappears. Their Dark God is not what he seems, believe me.
  119: How do you know?
  120: Don't you think you're being a bit paranoid?
  121: "'Us?' Is this what all the Followers think or just you?"
  122: Call it instinct. We've seen Morpheus and the Nightkin and they don't look
    like peace makers to us. Their hospitals and message of peace make them attractive,
    but we know there's evil there.
  123: Don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid?
  124: Do you have any clues?
  125: Well, I'll make sure to tell you anything I find out.
  126: "'We' this and 'we' that. Are you trying to put words in everyone's mouths?"
  127: Maybe, but it's what kept us alive this long.
  128: We are united. If not, we'll perish. Now forgive me if that irritates you.
  129: Is there anything else you need to know?
  130: Yeah.
  131: No, thanks. I'll be going now.
  132: Ask, and I'll answer if I can.
  133: We don't have time for questions from the likes of you. My assistant will show
    you out.
  134: Hey! I don't appreciate that, but I'll overlook it if you apologize.
  135: I'm sorry I ever talked to you.
  136: Okay, I'm sorry.
  137: Fine. We don't have time to baby-sit. Leave us.
  138: Apology accepted. Please remember you are a guest here. Now, is there anything
    else?
  139: Can I ask a few more questions?
  140: No, I'll be going now.
  141: We wish you the best in the journeys ahead. Please feel free to use our base
    as much as you like.
  142: We know it could be better. But when you're preparing for war...
  143: War with who?
  144: The Children of the Cathedral. We believe in bringing peace to the land, but
    there's some things that just can't be helped.
  145: What do you mean? What did they do?
  146: Why do you believe in peace?
  147: Ever since the Children showed up, anyone who doesn't believe in their vision
    disappears. They say that they are here for peace, but we know differently.
  148: How do you know?
  149: So what are you going to do about it?
  150: Where did the Children come from?
  151: All we can do is prepare. But the time will come when we must fight these Children
    and their Dark God.
  152: Sounds dangerous. I'll let you know anything I find out.
  153: I thought you said you believed in peace?
  154: Good! We could use any information. Now, is there anything else you'd like
    to ask?
  155: Yes, there is.
  156: No, thank you.
  157: We do believe in peace, but we will defend this land if we have to. If that
    means the Followers go to war, so be it.
  158: Sounds contradictory to me.
  159: That's kind of two-faced, isn't it?
  160: Okay. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  161: Not really. We came to teach peace, but we will defend ourselves, if necessary.
    That includes our beliefs
  162: You would not understand.
  163: Hmm, okay. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  164: All right. I think it's time for me to go.
  165: They showed up around the same time we did, but no one knows how they came
    about. We've heard rumors that their leader, Morpheus, was part of the Rippers
    before he was 'enlightened' by their Dark God.
  166: Hey, a guy can change.
  167: Sounds like he's not a nice fellow.
  168: I think I'll check it out.
  169: That's a very charitable description. Now, is there anything else?
  170: Yes, there is.
  171: No, thank you.
  172: Be very careful. Of course, we would love to know what's going on over there.
  173: Can I ask a few more questions?
  174: Thanks, I'll go now.
  175: We started this group after seeing that bloodshed still ruled the land. There
    seemed to be no hope left. Man can't live without hope.
  176: And you give hope?
  177: You sound like one of the Children!
  178: When did you start this group?
  179: We try. We try our best. Most people don't want to listen, but a few do.
  180: Well, I hope I can ask another question.
  181: It's time for me to leave.
  182: I'm sure you'd be bored with the telling of the entire history of the Followers.
    There a number of books in here with that information.
  183: Can I ask a few more questions?
  184: Well, thanks. I need to go now.
  185: A number of our spies have seen Nightkin coming in and out of the back room
    of the Children's temple. Something important is back there.
  186: Well, I'll report back anything I hear.
  187: Can I ask a few more questions?
  188: Interesting, but I gotta go.
  189: What would you like to know?
  190: Where did the Followers start?
  191: Who started it?
  192: What are your goals?
  193: Far to the south, near the Great Glow. The times were hard, but we managed
    to survive. We realized then the Great War must never happen again.
  194: So, you started the Followers of the Apocalypse?
  195: What made you come up north?
  196: After my parents were killed by a marauders, [sigh] it was time the killing
    stopped. It's our goal to make this land the way it used to be, before the war.
  197: I'm sorry about your parents.
  198: So it could happen again? That's stupid!
  199: Who were the marauders?
  200: What made you bring the Followers up north?
  201: We've never found out, although we've heard a group live up north in an old
    ruined city. We've let it rest.
  202: Why not? You could get revenge!
  203: Why did you end up bringing the Followers north?
  204: We're here to make peace, not kill in hatred.
  205: Sounds more like fear.
  206: Very noble of you. If it was me I'd kill them all.
  207: Why are you up here now?
  208: I'm not surprised. The Followers are here to talk sense into people like you.
  209: Good luck, it's a tough sell. Is that why you're up north now?
  210: And you don't think violence is ever good?
  211: Then answering more questions can't hurt, right?
  212: Well, I gotta go.
  213: "[Sigh] You're simply not ready to understand the differences. Okay. So why
    don't you just think about it, then come back to talk."
  214: There aren't many left down south. The radiation has polluted almost everything.
    Most of the remaining people followed us to start the organization.
  215: How did your family survive?
  216: It's still that radioactive? After 80 years?
  217: We lived on the outskirts of the Great Glow. Sickness had started spreading,
    so we gathered all the people and we made our way north. [Sigh] That's when my
    parents were killed.
  218: I'm sorry.
  219: Why is the area down there still that radioactive after all this time?
  220: Thank you, I appreciate that. Now, is there anything else you needed to ask
    me?
  221: Yes, there is.
  222: No, I need to run.
  223: Well, the rumor is that there was something so important there, that the area
    was saturated with bombs to insure everything was wiped out.
  224: Can I ask a few more questions?
  225: Interesting. But I have to go now.
  226: Well, the Boneyard is pretty scarce as you can see. Adytum is to the west.
    The Children of the Cathedral are to the north. I wouldn't advise going too far
    south into the city, though, the Rippers and the Blades have made it into a battlefield.
  227: About what?
  228: I know what's behind the Children of the Cathedral.
  229: How much are you willing to pay me?
  230: Nothing, never mind.
  231: Finally! What'd you find out?
  232: I'm now the leader of the Children!
  233: Morpheus is not the leader of the Children. It's actually run by the Master.
  234: You know the Nightkin?
  235: Wait a s...the Dark God? You're not telling me he's real.
  236: Oh, he's real all right, just not a god. He's a mutant who wants to make everyone
    a Nightkin, for their own good.
  237: Yes, he is! You should fear the all-mighty Dark God!
  238: What do the Nightkin have to do with this?
  239: They're actually a race of super mutants. The Master is their leader.
  240: 'What do they plan to do? '
  241: The Master wants to make everyone a Nightkin. He thinks they're superior, and
    he thinks that turning everyone into them will save humanity!
  242: I'm not sure. I just know that the Master is turning people into Nightkin.
  243: What should we do?
  244: I'm going to talk to the Master.
  245: I'm going to take out the Cathedral right now.
  246: I've destroyed the place where they make more Super Mutants, but I need help
    in taking out the Cathedral.
  247: We can't let this opportunity pass. You scout the Cathedral. We'll meet you
    there and help you storm the place.
  248: No, not that. Do you know if there's a secret way in?
  249: Okay. Meet me there.
  250: No! I don't want anyone else to be hurt.
  251: No, but I know someone who will. Go to the Cathedral and find a woman named
    Laura. Tell her 'Red Rider'. We'll create a diversion if we can.
  252: Thanks. I hope luck is with us.
  253: Luck has nothing to do with it. I have faith in you.
  254: Our destiny lies before us. Let us hope we are worthy.
  255: What? This is our destiny. The Followers will fight this evil so that the healing
    of the land can finally begin.
  256: No. I forbid it.
  257: Okay. Meet me at the Cathedral.
  258: "[Chuckle] You don't control us. We will attack, with or without your blessing!"
  259: Talk to him?! Are you crazy?
  260: Aren't you the one that preaches peace?
  261: No, and you can't stop me.
  262: Well, yes, but...
  263: I think I can end this without bloodshed. Be ready, though, in case I fail.
  264: Obviously, your mind is made up. This might help you. Go to the Cathedral and
    find a woman named Laura. Say the phrase 'Red Rider'. And please...come back safely.
  265: You have a strange sense of humor. Why don't you come back when you have something
    serious to say.
  266: Sorry, it was just a joke. It has to do with the Nightkin.
  267: So you're a mercenary. Fine, I'll give you 100 caps.
  268: Now, what do you have for me?
  269: I know someone is planning to con you out of some money. Thanks.
  270: Morpheus is not the leader of the Children. It's actually run by the Master.
  271: You know the Nightkin?
  272: The Children are controlled by space aliens.
  273: Good luck. Now we've got to examine our options.
  274: How noble, how impressive. And we thought you were different. Now take your
    money and leave.
  275: Well hi. What can I help you with now?
  276: I need to ask a few questions.
  277: Sorry, I gotta go.
  278: Nuh, nuh, uh?
  279: What do you want now?
  280: I wanted to say I'm sorry.
  281: I just wanted to see you again.
  282: Just leave
  283: Apology accepted. What can I help you with?
  284: Can I ask a few more questions?
  285: That was all for now. I gotta go.
  286: Please, we're busy. Don't you have things to do?
  287: What are you doing? Put that down!
  288: Stop!
  289: Stop that!
  290: Hey! Get out of here!
  291: Well, if you say so. Now run along, because we have work to do.
  292: Talk to Jake. He knows more about that.
  293: As I said...
  294: As I mentioned before...
  295: I said...
  296: Well, as I said...
  297: Hi! Are you an idiot?
  298: I've told you that numerous times. Maybe you should work on your memory.
  299: Morpheus is the leader of the Children of the Cathedral. He is evil, and that
    fact must be exposed.
  300: There's not much to tell.
  301: Laura is one of our insiders within the Cathedral. She's extremely loyal to
    our cause
  302: Jake is second in command.
  303: In here, you'll find historical texts and philosophical texts...almost anything.
    Feel free to look around.
  304: The Children of the Cathedral worship him. They say he only wants to heal humanity,
    but that's a lie.
  305: I've heard very little about him.
  306: They're the personal servants of Morpheus. They're huge, hulking creatures.
    Ugh!
  307: You've probably seen their hospitals around. They preach peace, but there is
    something wrong with them. We need to find out what.
  308: It's a small settlement. You'll find it to the west in the Boneyard.
  309: Before the Great War, this was a huge, thriving city. My mother told stories,
    but there's hardly anything left now. Just ruins and death.
  310: They war with the Blades down south. The Rippers are the most ruthless gang
    in the Boneyard. When we sent people to convert them, the only thing we got back
    were their heads.
  311: The Blades fight the Rippers down south. They're the most agreeable of the
    two gangs, though that's not saying much. We've converted a few of them.
  312: Our history is in the last case, top shelf.
  313: Everything was burned, everything destroyed. We try to teach people peace,
    so that it will never happen again.
  314: That's the trading city to the north. We're trying to set up a table there.
  315: We're not sure about them. They sell guns, we sell peace. But their motives...
  316: We know nothing about that.
  317: We've never heard of that.
  318: We don't know what you're talking about.
  319: What else do you know about the Children of the Cathedral?
  320: Can I ask you a few more questions about them?
  321: Can I ask you about something else?
  322: Do you know who their leader is?
  323: Do you have any suspicions about them?
  324: Can you help me destroy them?
  325: Thanks I can use all the help I can get!
  326: Thanks for the information. I'll be going now.
  980: We know nothing about that.
  981: We've never heard of that.
  982: We don't know what you're talking about.

  104: You break your lockpicks while trying to unlock the door.

    The water computer is useless without the water

  102: |-
    You fiddle with the computer, but don't really
     find out anything else about it.

  104: With the replacement chip, the computer seems to be functioning well.
GENSKAG:

  101: This place is neat!  It's much better than my old place.
  102: I like it here!
  103: There's so much space. If I had any stuff, I would have plenty of room.
  104: Where's my dog?
  105: I'm thirsty.
  106: Got any food?
  107: I'm hungry.
  108: Is it my bed time yet?
  109: You can have my old place.
  110: I'm tired, why are you here?
  111: This my home!  You leave!
  112: This my home!  You leave!
  113: Where's my pillow?

  104: |-
    I've got to find time between patrols and training to keep
     up with my studies. I think I'm getting a little rusty.
  105: |-
    You've got to keep your mind and body in top condition
     at all times, Initiate.
  106: |-
    Us Scribes design all the equipment, weapons, and supplies.
     It's quite exciting.
  107: Being a Paladin isn't just combat, son.
  108: Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my lady.
SLUMMER:
  100: 'You see a zombie. '
  101: 'You have committed many sins. I will pray for your redemption. '
  102: 'Hail the Master! Hail the Holy Flame! Hail Peace and Unity! '
  103: 'Hello my child. Why do you hold a weapon? Perhaps you need instruction in
    the ways of peace? '
  104: 'Praise to the Master, that at long last I have found a place where I can put
    down my arms and embrace peace! '
  105: 'Sounds good. Who would instruct me? '
  106: 'I''m on guard duty. '
  107: 'Sounds good to me. How about instruction and a back rub? '
  108: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  109: 'Screw peace. The Master''s making a power play, and I want a piece of the
    action. Where is he? '
  110: 'You say me stupid? '
  111: 'Hello. Nice weather, isn''t it? '
  112: 'Yeah, but there''s a storm brewing. The enemies of the Cathedral are everywhere.
    What rumors have you heard? '
  113: 'I''ve seen better. Who''s in charge here? '
  114: 'Yeah, nice weather. '
  115: 'Nice weather if you don''t mind a radioactive tan. '
  116: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  117: 'Screw the weather. I''m here to kill the Master. Where is that punk! '
  118: 'Yeah. Sunny. Sunny good. '
  119: 'Hello friend. It is good to see you. Put down your weapon, you are among friends
    here! '
  120: 'Sorry, it''s been a tough week. So what can you tell me about this place? '
  121: 'Sorry, but I''ve learned to be cautious. Who''s in charge here? '
  122: 'Friends, eh? That''s odd, I''ve heard a lot of bad things about you. '
  123: 'Nice to know I''m among friends here. What''s up? '
  124: 'Friends? How friendly do you want to get.. '
  125: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  126: 'Weapon? '
  127: 'Hello stranger. Forgive me, but you should not draw your weapon in the Cathedral. '
  128: 'I have brought my gun into the service of the Cathedral and its Master. Do
    you have a problem with this? '
  129: 'Thanks. I''ll be sure to remember that. '
  130: 'Old habit. A lot of things have tried to kill me lately. What can you tell
    me about this place? '
  131: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  132: 'Weapon? '
  133: 'Hello stranger. If you have come here to be redeemed, you are welcome here,
    but I would suggest you put away your weapon. '
  134: 'I have brought my gun into the service of the Cathedral and its Master. Do
    you have a problem with this? '
  135: 'Sure. Redeemed. Sounds good. '
  136: 'Old habit. A lot of things have tried to kill me lately. What can you tell
    me about this place? '
  137: 'Suggest anything you want, but if you want to keep breathing, you''ll tell
    me what I want to know. '
  138: 'Redeem my ass, zombie. '
  139: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  140: 'Weapon? '
  141: 'Hello friend! I''m so glad to see you''ve joined our cause! '
  142: 'I haven''t yet, though I''m interested. Aside from this Peace and Unity stuff,
    what are you guys all about? '
  143: 'It had to happen. Who do I see about the initiation? '
  144: 'I came here for instruction. Can I see the Master? '
  145: 'Friends? How friendly do you want to get.. '
  146: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  147: 'Raaar! The cause! Raaar!? '
  148: 'Hello stranger. May I help you? '
  149: 'Sure. I''ve heard your message, and I want to know more about you! '
  150: 'I was looking for the person in charge of this place. '
  151: 'This peace and unity stuff cannot be for real. '
  152: 'Who is this Master guy? '
  153: 'I could use a full body massage and maybe something extra. You interested? '
  154: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  155: 'Help? Uh.. no. '
  156: 'Forgive me stranger, but I have many duties. Please excuse me. '
  157: 'Hail the Master! Hail Peace! Hail the Holy Flame! Hail Unity! '
  158: 'I can go for the peace part, but why is the Master so important? '
  159: 'I was looking for the person in charge of this place. '
  160: 'This peace and unity stuff cannot be for real. '
  161: 'Who is this Master guy? '
  162: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  163: I would suggest that you find Brother Lasher. He is a hard man, but the Master
    works in mysterious ways. Farewell.
  165: 'But we have no guards, except for the Nightkin. What are you talking about? '
  166: 'The Master ordered extra security. Not sure why, I think the Nightkin are
    enough muscle as it is. You got any idea what''s going on? '
  167: 'Someone screwed up my orders. Don''t mind me. '
  168: 'I''m not one of the Cathedral guards, I''m one of the patrols. '
  169: 'We don''t? Oh shit! '
  170: 'I''m...ah...Oh well, nothing that can''t be solved with a bullet. DIE! '
  171: 'My apologies. Praise the Master, and have a nice day. '
  172: 'Maybe later. '
  173: 'I do not believe we have any. Praise the Master, I''m sure this is for the
    best. '
  174: 'I''m sure it is. [Groan]. '
  175: 'What kind of a Cathedral doesn''t even have holy wine? '
  176: 'Fine, so I''ll have to kill you when I''m sober. Like now. Die, you son of
    a bitch! '
  177: 'Many have tried to kill the Master, and all have failed. However, if you attempt
    this vile act, the Master may forgive you and find a good use for you. I shall
    pray for you. '
  178: 'I was only joking. People who spend a lot of time in the Wastes have a weird
    sense of humor, you know. So what''s happening around here? '
  179: 'We''ll see about that.. '
  180: 'Nobody prays for my soul. But somebody better start praying for you, because
    I''m killing you right now! '
  181: 'You have come to the wrong place, friend. This place is not about power. This
    place is about peace. '
  182: 'I hear that our Crusade goes well. Soon we shall bring Peace and Unity to
    the Boneyard, and all the surrounding communities  Isn''t it great? '
  183: 'Who''s next on the list to receive Peace and Unity? '
  184: 'That''s rather vague. Have you heard anything else? '
  185: 'Good. About time someone cleaned up this dump. '
  186: 'Yes. Isn''t death grand. '
  187: 'The person that you seek is Father Morpheus. He can be found in the tower.
    Is that all? '
  188: 'Is there anything I should know before I meet him? '
  189: 'We''ll see about that.. '
  190: 'Thanks! Fresh meat at last! '
  191: 'Is there something else on your mind, my child? '
  192: 'Sorry, it''s been a tough week. So what can you tell me about this place? '
  193: 'I am looking for further instruction in the ways of the Cathedral. Who should
    I see? '
  194: 'I was wondering who''s in charge? '
  195: 'I could use a full body massage and maybe something extra. You interested? '
  196: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  197: 'I was wondering what you''d look like if some maniac spilt your brains all
    over this nice Cathedral floor. Let''s find out! '
  198: 'You have a very good sense of humor, my child. Just don''t tell jokes to Brother
    Lasher. '
  199: 'Are there any other servants of the Master I should watch out for? '
  200: 'Maybe she spent a little too much time out in the Wastes? '
  201: 'I would like to see the Master. '
  202: 'I was wondering who''s in charge? '
  203: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  204: 'You know, that''s the nicest thing anyone''s said to me all day. I don''t
    think I''ll kill you after all. '
  205: 'I fear you may have had too much sun. I hope you find healing here. Praise
    the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! '
  206: 'Your words are full of such pain and hate! I pity you, my friend, but pity
    can be turned to joy. Seek Father Morpheus in the tower. He is a wonderful man,
    and can open your heart to love again. '
  207: 'Have you never been to the Cathedral before? This is a place of Peace and
    Unity. This is a place where differences are forgotten and we seek a future of
    unity and prosperity for all. A future where the horrors that our ancestors inflicted
    on us can never happen again! '
  208: 'And how do we achieve this perfect Utopia? '
  209: 'But does free will have to be sacrificed to create Utopia? '
  210: 'I would like to see the Master and hear what he has to say!. '
  211: 'How can you be so sure this ain''t some form of mind control? '
  212: 'They got any holy wine around this joint? '
  213: 'I agree. I prefer to inflict my own horrors on people. '
  214: 'Our enemies slander us! People are so easily frightened, especially when someone
    tells them what to do! But since I follow the Master and the Holy Flame, I don''t
    have to be afraid any more. The Master told me not to be afraid! '
  215: 'And how do we achieve this perfect Utopia? '
  216: 'Good for the Master! Any idea where I can find him? '
  217: 'But there are rumors about mutant armies... '
  218: 'Anyone ever tell you that you''re a zombie? '
  219: 'I agree. I prefer to inflict my own horrors on people. '
  220: 'Just praising the Master. I never get tired of praising of the Master. Why
    don''t you praise the Master with me, friend? '
  221: 'Why should I praise the Master? Go on, convince me. '
  222: 'Sure. Praise to the Master! How''s that? '
  223: 'I don''t think so. '
  224: 'Anyone ever tell you that you''re a zombie? '
  225: 'Let''s praise him over a few bottles of holy wine. Praising goes a lot better
    when the spirit moves you.. '
  226: 'You know, the one that''s in your hand? '
  227: 'Oh, that weapon. '
  228: 'Um, is it loaded? '
  229: 'I don''t know much. The mind of the Master is so great.. I do know that the
    Children are marching north. We will take control of all of the settlements, and
    baptize everyone! The baptism will change us and bring us closer to God, so we
    can have peace and unity, and there will never be war or destruction again! '
  230: 'And where is the baptismal font? '
  231: 'That sounds like he''s going to dump everybody in the FEV-2 Virus! '
  232: 'What a wonderful day that''s going to be! '
  233: 'Well I''ve heard all I need to know. '
  234: 'Then I better get in some destruction while I still have a chance. Die skag! '
  235: 'Praise the Master! Peace be with you! Enjoy your stay at the Cathedral. '
  236: 'This is a sanctuary, where those who wish to build a peaceful future can go,
    in order to realize their vision. '
  237: 'And what right do you have to impose your future on everyone? '
  238: 'But people have to leave sanctuaries and go out into the wide world. Otherwise,
    a sanctuary becomes a prison. '
  239: 'Nobody wants peace. Everyone''s out for numero uno, pal. Wake up! '
  240: 'Sounds good. Who do I see to sign up? '
  241: 'Peace? Sanctuary? You''re making me ill, zombie-boy! '
  242: 'I''m glad to hear you express an interest in peace. Talk with Father Morpheus
    and Brother Lasher. They can instruct you further. '
  243: 'I''m afraid I can''t help you. Only Father Morpheus communes with the Master.
    You can find him in the tower. '
  244: 'Is there anything I should know before I meet him? '
  245: 'Thanks. Be seeing you. '
  246: 'Father Morpheus. That''s a real peaceful sounding name. Who''s his assistant,
    Brother Murder? Brother Death? Sister Kill maybe? '
  247: 'I am more than willing to be reborn for my cause. Kill me if you must, but
    I will be redeemed and you will die. '
  248: 'Kid, one way or another, you''re spilling your guts right now! '
  249: 'I''d be happy if you just shut up. You zombies are giving me a headache. '
  250: 'You got guts, kid. I admire that. Maybe I won''t kill you. '
  251: 'I don''t give a rat''s ass about your soul, kid, but I''ll be damned if I
    turn down the invitation. One martyr, coming up! '
  252: 'Well... Uh.. Peace be with you.. I think... Farewell.. '
  253: 'Look around you? Do you not hear the messages? How can you doubt the Master''s
    sincerity? '
  254: 'Nobody wants peace. Everyone''s out for numero uno, pal. Wake up! '
  255: 'It''s easy to talk about peace, but what''s the Master really doing? '
  256: 'Forgive me, brother. The world is such a terrible place, and I worry about
    losing our freedom.. '
  257: 'It''s easy to talk about peace, but I hear terrible rumors of mutant armies.. '
  258: 'Maybe you''re right. Who do I see to sign up? '
  259: 'Sincerity only comes out of the barrel of a gun! '
  260: 'He is Keeper of the Holy Flame, one who strives to wipe away all divisions,
    all hatreds. He wields both sword and plowshare, but would rather build than destroy.
    Hail the Master! Hail Unity! '
  261: 'I hear that our Crusade goes well. We are marching north, and as the Master
    promised, the forces of the Dark Age are no match for an army of the Enlightened.
    These are glorious times! Lift up your head, friend, and shout with praise! '
  262: 'And what happens to those we defeat? Can we dispel a Dark Age with blood?
    With tyranny? '
  263: 'Man, I wanna just start dancing! '
  264: 'Well I''ve heard all I need to know. '
  265: 'No thanks. I''ve got a sore throat. I''d rather celebrate in my own way -
    by killing you! '
  266: 'I did not mean to insult you, nor to interfere in your duties. Please accept
    my apologies. May the Master bless you for your service. '
  267: 'My apologies. Praise the Master, and have a nice day. '
  268: 'Yours is a sad soul, my friend. I can only guess what horrors you''ve seen
    that makes you close your mind. Open it now, and find peace. Watch the screens,
    listen to Father Morpheus, and praise the Master. '
  269: 'I know nothing, my friend, nothing! You shall have to find someone else to
    answer your inquiry. But it is not wise to ask about the Nightkin. '
  270: 'Sure. No problem. '
  271: 'Why''s that? '
  272: 'I only have one question about them. Do they scream real loud when you kill
    them? '
  273: 'You know nothing? You must be stupid? '
  274: 'Nightkin! Nightkin! Kill! '
  275: 'This has been a wonderful talk, but I am falling behind in my praises. Farewell.
    Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! Let us sing the sacred songs.. '
  276: 'If you do not like it here, you can leave. Praise the Master, and have a nice
    day. '
  277: 'I pity the Wastes, if that is a sample of the warped humor it breeds. I would
    not share it with the others. '
  278: 'Anyone in particular I should avoid? '
  279: 'This place must be no fun at all! '
  280: 'Okay, I''ll cut the jokes. '
  281: 'Have you heard the one about the nuke jockey and the traveling salesman? '
  282: 'Are you sure I can''t show you what I do for laughs.. '
  283: 'Not that I can think of. Farewell, friend. '
  284: 'I do not believe that I can help you, my friend. Farewell, and have a nice
    day. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame.. '
  285: 'I can''t help you with that, I''m afraid. Well, I must meditate on the glories
    of the Master. Please excuse me. Hail the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! '
  286: 'Everyone here is filled with love! But it''s hard for some people to express
    their love, and the Nightkin find it extremely hard to express it. But you shall
    discover this on your own. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! '
  287: 'We must submit to the Master and the Holy Flame. When we have proven ourselves,
    we shall become baptized and closer to God. When all have been baptized, we shall
    be as one, a Unity under the Master! '
  288: 'Tell me more about this baptism. '
  289: 'What happens if someone doesn''t want to be baptized? '
  290: 'Sounds interesting. Mind if I look around a little more? '
  291: 'I think you''re all a bunch of zombies. '
  292: 'There''s only one Unity for mankind, and that''s when we become wormfood. '
  293: 'We have a right to survive. The ancients tried to survive and keep their freedom,
    and look at what they did to us! We must not make the same mistakes. Unity is
    the only solution. It''s the only way to save what humanity has become! '
  294: 'What do you mean what humanity has become? We''re still perfectly human. '
  295: 'Perhaps the mistake our ancestors made wasn''t lack of unity. Maybe they couldn''t
    leave other people alone. '
  296: 'I ain''t no philosopher, but I know when something''s right and something''s
    wrong, and this is wrong. '
  297: 'Maybe you''re right. '
  298: 'Humanity ain''t worth saving, and neither are you. Die, you little zombie! '
  299: 'The Master has said that it was lack of Unity, so it must have been. Seek
    his high priest! Father Morpheus will correct the lies you have been told. '
  300: 'We''re not zombies! When I was a member of the Fighting Flesh street gang,
    I was a psychotic fool who did anything that the higher-ups told me to do! Praise
    to the Master that I am no longer so blind! Oh, praise the Master! Let''s praise
    him together, shall we? '
  301: 'I could praise him better if I knew what he was doing. '
  302: 'Praise the Master! '
  303: 'You praise the Master, I''m outta here. '
  304: 'How about praising him together over some holy wine. I need a drink! '
  305: 'I''ve got an even better idea. I''ll praise him over your dead zombie corpse.
    Time to die! '
  306: 'Isn''t it wonderful that the Master would unite humans and mutants? He transcends
    hatred and prejudice. Can''t you see, this proves that he wants what''s best for
    everyone! '
  307: 'I suppose the armies are sharing love and brotherhood everywhere they go.. '
  308: 'I guess he''s not doing it because mutants are more effective killers. '
  309: 'Praise the Master! '
  310: 'I need more proof. '
  311: 'How about praising him together over some holy wine. I need a drink! '
  312: 'I see it now. I''ll follow the Master''s example! I know what''s best for
    you, therefore, I must kill you now! Makes perfect sense.. '
  313: 'Open your heart. Open your mind. Listen to what people are saying, and you
    will find enlightenment. '
  314: 'Perhaps there''s someone who can explain things more directly. Is the Master
    available.. '
  315: 'What I''m seeing are a bunch of zombies! '
  316: 'Those ain''t reasons, Those are propaganda! '
  317: 'I think I''ll just walk around and see for myself. '
  318: 'I''d rather open a bottle of wine. Where is the booze around here? '
  319: 'You zombies make me sick! I want to kill each and every one of you! '
  320: 'How sad. I will pray for you. '
  321: 'Unfortunately, I have never been privileged enough to see the baptismal font.
    Perhaps if I offer enough praise to the Master, I will receive a blessing. Hail
    the Master! Hail the Holy Flame! Hail Peace and Unity! '
  322: 'Of course he won''t. He''s the Master. He would never do that to his disciples.
    It is his holy power through baptism, and the Holy Flame, that will transform
    us. The virus is an evil of the old time, which I''m sure will be cleansed. '
  323: 'We have no desire to bring you distress. If we cannot comfort you, please
    find another place where you can deal with your torment. This is a place of peace. '
  324: 'I''m outta here! '
  325: 'I told you to shut up. Why can''t you listen? '
  326: 'I guess the only way to get peace and quiet is to kill you all! Die!! '
  327: 'You will have to find the answer to that question yourself. Praise the Master!
    Praise the Holy Flame! '
  328: 'The baptism will change us all, and bring our physical forms closer to God''s
    own image. When we have all become God, all our differences will disappear, so
    we can have peace and unity at last, and there will never be war or destruction
    again! '
  329: 'And where is the baptismal font? '
  330: 'That sounds like he''s going to dump everybody in the FEV-2 Virus! '
  331: 'What a wonderful day that''s going to be! '
  332: 'Well I''ve heard all I need to know. '
  333: 'Then I better get in some destruction while I still have a chance. Die asshole! '
  334: 'Once people understand the Master and what he stands for, everyone will want
    to be baptized. The only people who would not wish to be baptized are the insane,
    and they should be put out of their misery for their own safety, poor wretched
    things. '
  335: 'Aren''t you surprised by the number of insane people you''ve encountered already? '
  336: 'You''re nuts! '
  337: 'I think I''d better look around a little more. '
  338: 'Yeah. Poor wretched things. Let''s break out the holy wine and drink to them! '
  339: 'Hey, if you need anyone put out of their misery - or yours - I''m available! '
  340: 'Friend, if you look for the truth with an open mind, you will find us waiting
    for you. Praise the Master! I wish you well on your quest for enlightenment. '
  341: 'We must become closer to God, mutant and human alike. I''m not sure what the
    Master means with this particular part of the message, but it must be true. Praise
    the Master, he is so wise! '
  342: 'But if he were truly wise, would his message have any ambiguity? '
  343: 'You''re nuts! '
  344: 'I think I''d better look around a little more. '
  345: 'Yeah. I''ve got a great idea! Let''s break out the holy wine and drink a toast
    to the master''s wisdom! '
  346: 'All the wisdom in the world won''t help against a .56 caliber slug between
    the eyes. '
  347: 'We''re forging a world that''s better for everyone. That''s all. I''m sorry
    if you don''t understand yet. I pray that someone wiser than I can change your
    mind. Farewell, my friend. Praise the Master! Praise Peace and Unity! '
  348: 'The world holds many surprises, my friend, some pleasant, some unpleasant.
    Farewell, my friend, and praise the Master! '
  349: "[done] "
CAVEWALL:
  100: This portion of the cave seems a bit weaker.
  101: The rock here looks very fragmented, and will most likely crumble under extreme
    conditions.
HICRAPS:
  100: You see before you the low stakes Craps table. It costs $40 to play.
  101: You rolled a 7. You will!!

HBETH:
  100: You see Beth, owner of the Weapon Shop.
  101: Hi there.  How can I help you?
  102: Can I ask you some questions?
  103: Could I ask you some more questions?
  104: I want to buy something.
  105: I have something to sell.
  106: How does someone make money around here?
  107: Nothing. Bye.
  108: Ruk?
  109: 'What''s the word out on the street about the missing caravans? '
  110: What do you know about the Deathclaw?
  111: Could you tell me about the Deathclaw again?
  112: 'What can you tell me about Decker? '
  113: What can you tell me about the different merchants?
  114: Have you heard any good rumors?
  115: Thanks, that's all.  Bye.
  116: Umm, never mind.
  117: |-
    Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination
     hit on Jain.
  118: |-
    Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three
     extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.
  119: |-
    Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the
     Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.
  121: |-
    Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but a merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around
     in the desert up past the Brotherhood of Steel, far to the Northwest.
  122: |-
    Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but the Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are.
     I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.
  123: |-
    Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination
     hit on Jain.
  124: |-
    There is something else. I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three
     extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.
  125: |-
    There is something else. Someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the
     Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.
  126: |-
    There is something else. A merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around

    There is something else. The Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are.
     I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.
  128: Anything else?
  129: Thanks, can I as you another question?
  130: Okay, thanks.
  131: I'm sorry, what was that?
  132: Klug?
  133: Ruk!
  134: I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please come back when you are feeling better.
  135: |-
    Well I'm not hiring but there's a job post in the center of the Merchant Market, you might want
     to check there.
  136: Okay, thanks.
  137: |-
    No, nothing good at least. Give me a chance to do some digging.
     <She winks at you>. Anything else?
  138: Yes.
  139: No.
  140: What else can I do for you?
  141: Of course you can, don't be silly.
  142: Why sure, I'd be happy to help. What did you need to know?
  143: All right. Well it's been nice talking to you, have a nice day.
  144: No, that's all. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
  145: Yes.
  146: No.
  147: Well come back soon.  Don't be a stranger.
  148: Now there's someone you don't ever want to mess with, he scares me. He 'owns'
    the Maltese Falcon.
  149: Why did you say it like that? He 'owns' the Maltese Falcon.
  150: 'Why does he scare you? '
  151: |-
    Sorry, it just reminds me of a friend that used to own it before him.
     Decker wanted it really bad, but my friend wouldn't sell.
     Two days later they found him dead in a back alley of Old Town.
  152: Why do you think Decker's responsible?
  153: Well he should have known better than to mess with Decker.
  154: Sorry, but I have to go.
  155: |-
    My friend was a clean freak. He wouldn't come within a hundred yards
     of Old Town.  He was shot with a Magnum; no one in Old Town could afford
     one of those. Plus, he was shot once in the head and twice in the back.
     Does that sound like a robbery? My friend was just trying to get his life back.
  156: |-
    Hey, I like his style. After you kill him, put his body in the
     place he despises the most.
  157: Get his life back?
  158: I'm sorry to hear that.
  159: Oh, okay.
  160: |-
    You probably don't understand, but most of us look forward to the day when we own our own lives.
     When our lives don't belong to the merchants or the money lenders.
  161: Oh, thanks.
  162: Don't you ever stop talking?!
  163: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
  164: Is there anything else I can do for you?
  165: Well, excuse me. YOU asked.
  166: |-
    He's the deadliest person in the Hub; most say that he runs this place, not the merchants or the
     police. If you ever cross him, watch out.
  167: That gives him no right to kill anyone.
  168: You make me sick, please leave. I'm sure he's missing your company.
  169: |-
    Well, there are three main merchant groups. There's the Water Merchants, the Crimson Caravan,
     and the Far Go Traders. They also run the city council. What do you want to know about?
  170: The Water Merchants.
  172: The Crimson Caravan.
  173: The Far Go Traders.
  174: The City Council.
  175: That's all. Thanks for the information.
  176: Actually, never mind.
  177: |-
    They're in charge of all the water. Greedy people, I wouldn't want to work for them.  Their pay
     is the worst and the jobs are just as bad.
  178: 'Did they always control all the water? '
  179: Are they the ones behind the missing caravans?
  180: Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
  181: Thanks, bye.
  182: What else would you like to know about?
  183: |-
    No. From what I've heard, a while back a group of merchants seized control of the water tower
     and proclaimed that they were the water merchants and people had to get water from them. The merchant war
     raged on for years until a man named Roy Greene - yeah, Justin's Grandfather, that's it - helped to
     negotiate an agreement that ended the war.
  184: What kind of agreement?
  185: Damn! Sorry I asked.
  186: Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
  187: Thanks, bye.
  188: |-
    Well he set up the city council and set a limit on the price of water.
     Personally I think they should have beat the tar out of them - oh, sorry.
     I mean they should have showed them who's boss.
  189: Great. I didn't need quite that much information but thanks just the same.
  190: Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
  191: Thanks, bye.
  192: |-
    Sorry I tend to get carried away with myself.
     Was there anything else you wanted to know about?
  193: |-
    The Crimson Caravan are a bunch of crazy people. They will do any job,
     no matter what the risk. I'm surprised they aren't missing more caravans
     than they are.
  194: They're missing caravans too?
  195: How risky?
  196: Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
  197: Thanks, bye.
  198: |-
    They will pass right through an area known to be attacked by raiders.
     They charge a lot so they can hire extra hands. The pay's great but you have
     to be alive to spend it, right?
  199: They're missing caravans too?
  200: Thanks, another question about the merchants.
  201: Thanks, bye.
  202: |-
    Actually all the merchants have had a few caravans disappear.
     The Far Go Traders are just unlucky, I suppose.
  203: How risky?
  204: Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
  205: Thanks, bye.
  206: |-
    The Far Go Traders pay well and their jobs aren't too deadly.
     Butch owns this shop, a good man. They're fair and let me do as I please
     with the place; I like working with them.  Plus you get a discount
     on anything you buy here if you work for Butch.
  207: |-
    Personally I don't think so. I think it was the Deathclaw or maybe
     the Brotherhood of Steel.
  208: Why don't you think it's the Water Merchants?
  209: What exactly is a Deathclaw?
  210: 'Could you tell me about the Deathclaw again? '
  211: Who are the Brotherhood?
  212: Why do you think it was the Brotherhood of Steel?
  213: Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
  214: Okay, well I got to go.
  215: |-
    Some people think the Water Merchants are responsible, but I don't think so.  I think it was that
     darn Deathclaw, or maybe the people over at the Brotherhood of Steel.
  216: |-
    Well, I thought that it was destroying the caravans, but I guess not.  It's still out there though.
     There are too many rumors floating around for it not to exist.
  217: |-
    I think that's what's taking the caravans. It could also be the
     Brotherhood of Steel; they're a strange bunch. Some people think it's the
     Water Merchants, but they're wrong.
  218: Sure.
  219: |-
    Because, like I've been telling everyone, they've had a few caravans disappear too.  Nothing like
     what's happening to the Far Go Traders, but they are being affected.
  220: They could be lying or it could be part of their plan to make you believe them.
  221: 'Why would it happen to the Far Go Traders more than the others? '
  222: Another question about the missing caravans . . .
  223: 'Thanks, let''s get back to the merchants. '
  224: You're full of crap!
  225: Thanks, but I have to go.
  226: Excuse you! You're awfully quick to judge, are you afraid of the truth?
  227: |-
    There are six representatives two from each of the main merchant groups.
     Everything needs at least four votes to be passed.
     They can never agree on anything.
  228: |-
    Good thought, but I highly doubt it. They've been sabotaging each other
     for years, but this is not their style. They wouldn't spend that much money to
     take out the caravans. Plus all the caravans are very heavily guarded.
     You would think someone would escape. They don't have the man power or
     the cash to pull that off. There would have been at least one survivor.
  229: Yeah, but why would it happen to the Far Go Traders more than the others?
  230: Another question about the missing caravans . . .
  231: Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
  232: 'Thanks, but I have to go. '
  233: |-
    Bad luck? I don't know, maybe they're traveling along different routes
     than the others. Maybe because they aren't as heavily guarded as the Crimson
     Caravan but . . . they might have better cargo than the Water
     Merchants. Who knows. There doesn't seem to be any clear difference between
     the three.
  234: "The Water Merchants could be lying or it could be part of their plan,\n to
    make you believe them. "
  235: Another question about the missing caravans . . .
  236: 'Thanks, let''s get back to the merchants. '

  238: Thanks, but I have to go.

    The Deathclaw is the most evil thing to rise out of the ashes after the War.  Some say it's a
     powerful ghost from the war that haunts the land. It's no ghost, it's as real as you and me.
     It's 20 feet tall with teeth as big as your arm.  It's some kind of demon that found it's way here when
     the world was engulfed in fire.
  241: Uh, sorry I asked.
  242: You're crazy! I should just end your misery right here and now.
  243: Do you know anything else about the Deathclaw?
  244: Wow! Do you know where it is?
  245: |-
    Well, I know this old mutant in Old Town named Harold. He's seen it.
     He's the 'only' one that's seen it and lived.
  246: The only one that's seen it and lived?
  247: Yeah, sure, and I'm the Deathclaw's daddy
  248: Yeah, sure, and I'm the Deathclaw's mommy.

  257: |-
    Yeah, pretty amazing isn't it. It's down to the southwest somewhere.
     There's an old mutant in Old Town named Harold who actually saw this thing
     in its lair. Nicest Skag I know.

    The Brotherhood of Steel is full of crazy people that worship technology;
     they're to the northwest of here. They make human sacrifices and do all
     sorts of other terrible things.
  262: That's absurd! Who told you that?
  263: Another question about the missing caravans . . .
  264: Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
  265: That's terrible, thanks for the warning. Bye.
  266: |-
    Well, um. I don't remember, but who ever it was wouldn't lie . . .
     I mean, it might be true! You should be careful just the same.
  267: Another question about the missing caravans . . .
  268: Well, let's get back to the merchants.
  269: You're an idiot!
  270: Look at the time, I've got to go! See ya.
  271: |-
    Why, you don't know? [whispering] I heard that they make human sacrifices
     and do all sorts of other terrible things!
  272: Yes, we do. What's wrong with that?
  273: |-
    As a 'MEMBER' of the Brotherhood, I can ASSURE you that NOTHING
     like that is going on!
  274: Really? I've been there, they seemed strange but not that bad.
  275: Really? I had no idea.
  276: |-
    Like you don't know. You're obviously one of them, walking around in that
     metal suit. You're all a bunch of sick people.
  277: |-
    I don't know what you're getting at, but I can assure you nothing 'sick'
     is going on at the Brotherhood.
  278: Yeah, so. Aren't we all?
  279: I had no idea.
  280: Excuse me, sir. Please put your weapon down.
  281: Excuse me, ma'am. Please put your weapon down.
  282: I'm sorry but I won't help you unless you put your weapon away.  This is a
    shop not an arena.
  283: |-
    Uhh . . . well, yeah . . . umm You . . . I . . . Is there anything
     else you needed?
  284: |-
    You never know what a person's really like behind closed doors.  You've got to be careful with
     who you associate yourself with.  Was there anything else you needed?
  285: |-
    You're a . . . ?  I mean. I didn't mean . . . Umm . . .
     Lovely day we're having. Don't you think so?
     So, was there anything else I can do for you?
  286: Another question about the missing caravans . . .
  287: Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
  288: No, that's it. Bye.
  289: Sure, whatever you say. Was there anything else that I can do for you?
  290: Great! Let me show you what I've got.
  291: I've got the best goods, what are you looking for?
  292: That's what I like to hear! What do you need?
  293: Let's get down to business.
  294: If you've got money, you've got my attention.
  295: My favorite kind of customer!
  296: You want to buy something? Maybe I was wrong about you.
  297: Oh, that's right. You're working for Butch, you get the 15% discount.
  298: I'll still give you the 15% discount, because I like you.
  299: Sorry, you don't get a discount anymore.
  300: Show me what you've got.
  301: Do you have anything good?
  302: Well, let's see.
  303: Sure.
  304: What do you have for me today?
  305: That's great. I can always use more merchandise.
  306: I'd be happy to take a look at what you've got.
  307: Don't try to rip me off.
  308: I might let you sell me something, it better be good.
  309: You better not be wasting my time.
  310: I hope you have something I need, this time.
  311: Hello again.  Nice to see you.  How can I help you on this fine day?
  312: Why hello!  It's nice to see you again.  What can I do for you today?
  313: I wish I could get a day off, it's been so lovely out.
  314: Why hello again, aren't we looking handsome today?
  315: 'Back so soon? '
  316: You just left.  Miss me already?
  317: Need something already.
  318: Long time no see, what can I get you today?
  319: It's been a while, I hope you've been well.
  320: Still alive I see. I was starting to worry. What can I get you today?
  321: |-
    There you are. It's been more than a week since you last stopped in.
     You must stay in touch, you ARE my favorite customer!
  322: Yes?

  325: This is my shop, you better behave.
  326: What is it!
  327: You again?
  328: Time is money, what is it?
  329: Did you need something?
  330: |-
    Did you hear? He's dead! I'm overjoyed!
     That's the best thing that's ever happened to this city.
  331: |-
    I already told you. He's dead! Let's just forget about him,
     his name brings back bad memories.
  332: Oh, yeah.
  333: Yeah, he deserved it and I don't feel bad about doing it.
  334: |-
    You did it? Really? I love you! [Beth looks over at Sid]
     Don't even think about it wise guy . . .  Here, to show my gratitude . . .

  335: |-
    You did it? Really? You're the best!
     You have no idea how happy I was to hear that he was dead. Here take these . . .
     [Beth gives you six stimpaks.] It's not much, but I really appreciate it!
  336: Sorry I don't have anything you like.
  337: Don't see anything you like? I'll try to get better goods.
  338: |-
    Sorry if you didn't like my offer, but I've got to be able to sell
     if for a profit.
  339: Don't want to sell after all? That's okay.

  341: Maybe next time. Bye.
  342: Hope I can help you better next time.
  343: Stop wasting my time.
  344: If you're not going to buy anything, please leave.
  345: If you didn't want to buy something I wish you would leave me alone.
  346: If you're not selling, please leave.
  347: Don't bother me if you don't want to sell.
  348: Please leave.

  353: Hope you can carry all that!
  354: Thanks, I hope I can sell all this stuff!
  356: These should sell well, thank you.
  357: I can use these. Thanks.

  363: Bye! And thanks!
  364: |-
    That's it, just ammunition? I'm disappointed.
     Well, next time you'll need to spend more!
  365: Stocking up on ammunition? It's a good idea. You can never have enough.
  366: Just the essentials, right? Bye!
  367: Well, I didn't think you where actually going to buy anything.
  368: Thanks for the business, you're not so bad.
  369: Thanks for the goods.
  370: Have a nice day.
  371: Bye.
  372: Thank you.
  373: Thanks for the purchases, have a nice day.
  374: I heard that!
  375: No kidding.
  376: Sid! Stop that!
  377: I'll give you a gift if you don't shut up.
  378: I heard that! You're fired!
  379: Ignore him, I always do.
  380: Oh, you're just hilarious Sid.
  381: You wish.
  382: Shut up.
  383: Hey.  Stay put Sid.
  384: I don't think so slick.
  385: I'll make you blue if you don't leave my customer's alone.
  386: Please excuse my 'obnoxious' guard.
  387: You're such a knob!
  388: Sid!
  389: Honey? Where do you come up with these disturbing names?
  390: "[Beth sighs] I"
  391: " should lock him up. Don't you think?"
  392: I think he's jealous!
  393: Sid! Don't be rude to the customers!
  394: Anyone else you know who might have some information about the Death Claw?
  395: Goodbye.
  396: Thanks.
  397: Ook.
  398: Is there anyplace in town I should avoid?
  399: |-
    Oh yes. You ought to stay as far away from the Maltese Falcon
     as you possibly can. Decker and his greasy lapdog Kane are bad news.
     They'll eat you alive if you're not careful.
     I'd also give Lorenzo at the Friendly Lending company a wide berth.
DEADCOMP:

  104: Move faster, messenger.
  105: Normals cannot carry weapons here! Halt and identify yourself!
  106: Grrr!
  107: Uh, sorry. I'll put it away.
  108: I'm just passing through. No need for identities here.
  109: Die! Die! Die! I always wanted to say that.
  110: I will not be spoken to that way. You will be punished.
  111: Halt! What is your business here, 'child'.
  112: Hng!
  113: I'm, uh, doing stuff.
  114: I'm on important business. You have no right to stop and question me.
  115: Don't talk to me, big boy.
  116: |-
    Your answer does not settle my nerves. Speak quickly and clearly, or
     I will assume you are here for foul purposes. I assure you that you will
     not like that...
  117: Uh, no, really, honestly. I'm doing stuff.
  118: I'm bringing a message to our leader.
  119: |-
    I sense the untruth behind your words. You will not be allowed in.
     This I promise you...
  120: You may pass, but next time, follow the proper procedure...
  121: Ok, thanks. See you around.
  122: And what's that?
  123: Blessing to you, brother.
  124: |-
    A true follower of the Master would have that knowledge. You are
     an intruder!
  125: Move along. I don't have time for your questions.
  126: You are annoying me.
  127: I have work to do. Do you?
  128: You are making a mistake by coming here. Explain yourself or perish...
  129: Nuggie!
  130: I have nothing to say.
  131: I'm here to protect humanity from the likes of you.
  132: Oh, shut up!
  133: You should not try to fool me by playing dumb. I tire of this...
  134: |-
    What kind of foolish bigotry is that, we are 'humanity.' We're just
     as human as you are.
  135: What kind of crap is that?
  136: There is no possible way that you are human.
  137: |-
    My name is Kyle. I was born to a mother and a father, like yourself.
     The Master just oversaw my rebirth. These muscles, this skin, this strength
     does not make me any less human than you. I do not like all that the Unity
     stands for, but it is the best chance for peace that we have.
  138: Not on my watch, it isn't. I'm here to put an end to you and your kind.
  139: |-
    You may be human, but that still doesn't make your Unity right. I
     guess we will be enemies.
  140: It is a pity that you act this way, but you will not proceed further...
  141: It will be a true shame to see your head on a pike.
  142: Intruders!
  143: I no speak to you.
  200: 'You gain '

  107: Say hello to our mutual friend if you see him again.
  108: The Brotherhood reminds me of home.
GENMUTAN:
  100: Stop!
  101: Die, human!
  102: To the death.
  103: You will pay for your sins!
  104: |-
    You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little brother. Explain
     yourself.
  105: |-
    You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little sister. Explain
     yourself.
  106: Hngg.
  107: It's okay, I work here.
  108: It's okay, I have a pass.
  109: I am armed by permission of the Lieutenant.
  110: What manner of treason is this?!
  111: Show me your pass, then.
  112: I, uh, left it in my other robe.
  113: It's right here, stapled to the front of my gun.
  114: Hurry on your task then, but be warned, I'm watching you.
  115: Yes, little brother. What is it that you need from me?
  116: Yes, little sister. What is it that you need from me?
  117: Hng!
  118: Hmm, where's this Master guy?
  119: Praise to the Unity, brother.
  120: I am sorry, but you will have to find the way to Unity yourself.
  121: You are obviously a heathen! Pay for your sins!
  122: He resides on Level 3, as he must. Why do you ask such a silly question?
  123: Oh, uh, no reason.
  124: I am going to kick his ass from here to, uh, someplace really far away!
  125: What question? I said 'Hail to the Master, goodbye.'
  126: You insult me! Die!
  127: Praise to the Unity.
  128: |-
    You sound like you do not believe what you say. Could this be true?
     Or have you left the path of righteousness?
  129: |-
    You mistake the tremor in my voice for fear when it is actually
     a cold of some sort.
  130: |-
    I think your kind is doomed, actually. Here, let me prove it with
     some help from my friends . . .
  131: |-
    When you become one of us, you will not fear such minor things.
     Begone.
  132: What do you want this time? I have little time for your talk.
  133: Labbo!
  134: I have little time for your life . . . Die!
  135: Nothing, sorry.
  136: Praise to the Unity, brother.
  137: Just who are you? Let me see . . . Argh! An intruder . . .
  138: Move along. Do your part for the Unity and stop bothering me!
  139: Get going.
  140: Move along. Do your part for the Unity.
HTWRLEON:
  100: You see Leon, a guard.
  101: What is your business here?
  102: I must speak with Mr. Hightower.
  103: I've come to kill Mr. Hightower.
  104: What business is it of yours?
  105: Ok.  But I'm watching you.  He's in his office.
  106: Thank you.
  107: Yeah... I bet you're watching me.
  108: I don't like your attitude.  I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
  109: I'll leave when I'm good and ready, pal!
  110: Ok, I'll leave.
  111: Attitude?  I'l show you attitude!!!
  112: Whatever it is, you can tell me.  Mr. H is busy right now.
  113: Why do you have to be so difficult?
  114: I would much rather tell him in person.  It's a matter of life and death.
  115: Decker has put a contract out on Hightower's life.
  116: You can tell me, or you can leave.
  117: Who died and made you God?
  118: Decker has put a contract out on Hightower's life.
  119: Look, I'm not tellin' you a damn thing!
  120: I'll leave.
  121: |-
    Again?  What a fool Decker is.  Well?... I guess he's not as big a fool as the guys he hires for these jobs.  See here,
     check out my gun.
  122: "[Leon shows you the side of his gun where 5 deep scratch marks are visible.]"
  123: |-
    Each one of these marks is for a past attempt on Hightower's life.  I bagged each and every one of them.  Tell me...
     do you know what this fool Decker hired looks like?
  124: No.
  125: It's me, you idiot!
  126: Hey! Wow!  You've got scratch marks on your gun!  You're coooooool!
  127: |-
    Thank you for the advance warning, but Mr. Hightower doesn't like strangers hangin' around.  I'm going
     to have to ask you to leave.
  128: That's it?  No reward? What the hell is wrong with you people?
  129: You're welcome.  Goodbye.
  130: Mr. Hightower is not taking any visitors.  Now leave!
  131: I'll leave when I'm good and ready, pal!
  132: Ok, I'll leave.
  133: I really need to speak to Mr. Hightower.
  134: Ok, buddy.  Let's go. [Leon grabs you by the arm.]
  135: Get your damn hands off of me!
  136: All right, all right!  I'm going.
  137: Wait!  I'm not finished!
  138: Ug!
  139: Rookl!
  140: I have urgent news for Mr. Hightower.
  141: What are you doing here?  I'm off duty now.  Go bother someone else.
  142: I was hoping your sorry hide would wander around here sometime!  Guards!

  114: Okay.

  116: |-
    It was the 'pet' of a traveler. When the traveler died, this

  117: Oh.
  118: Who was this traveler?
  119: What did the traveler look like?
  120: |-
    I don't know. Some guy. He came from the east, he said.

     business.

    So, Gizmo had a couple of boys beat him up and throw him from

  123: |-
    Oh, the guy was tall, dark-haired with a little graying
     around the edges. He was dressed all in black leather,
     like that's a good idea in the desert, and carried
     a shotgun.
  124: |-

  104: Neither am I. I only kill when I have to.
  105: Aren't you going to praise the Master or something!
  106: I'll trade your life for a good stiff drink. Where do they keep the booze?
  107: Good night bitch!
  108: Me Big Soldier! Hah! Hah! Hah!
  109: I'm glad you came to talk to me. I heard what you said to Laura. You mustn't
    do this.
  110: What do you think I'm going to do?
  111: Laura? Who's Laura?
  112: Oh, oh.
  113: Oh, that was a big mistake! And it's gonna cost you.
  114: Wha tak? Raar!
  115: I think we've said all that needs to be said. Good bye.
  116: I do not speak to people at the point of a weapon. Lower it, and we may talk.
  117: Hello again. I hope you've found this place interesting.
  118: I've seen higher forms of entertainment.
  119: Of course, sister. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame!
  120: You know, every time I talk to someone, people keep repeating everything they
    say over and over again.
  121: Entertainment? Where's the booze!
  122: This place is boring! Where's the blood? Where's the death?
  123: Greetings initiate. How may I be of service to you?
  124: I was a little nervous about our long range plans.
  125: What's going on around here?
  126: Where's the Master?
  127: Who's in charge here?
  128: Gimme a break sister. Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their
    head!
  129: Hello, sir. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you
    with?
  130: Hello, miss. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you
    with?
  131: I was wondering what the Cathedral is all about.
  132: How does one become an initiate?
  133: Where's the Master?
  134: Who's in charge here?
  135: Gimme a break sister. Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their
    head!
  136: Hello, sir. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you
    with?
  137: Hello, miss. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you
    with?
  138: I was wondering what the Cathedral is all about.
  139: How does one become an initiate?
  140: Where's the Master?
  141: Who's in charge here?
  142: Gimme a break sister. Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their
    head!
  143: I know who you are. And you will forgive my rudeness, but I don't speak to
    psychotic killers. Good-bye.
  144: My reputation has been greatly exaggerated. Does the Cathedral judge people
    on rumor and innuendo?
  145: Psychotic killer? Who, me!
  146: Baby, I'm no psycho, I'm just plain nuts, and if you don't answer my questions
    I'll prove it!
  147: I do not form bonds of loyalty easily. And I do not break them easily either.
    I will tell you nothing.
  148: Good. Then we can leave each other alone and call it even.
  149: Praising the Master will not save my life. Go ahead, and do it. I can do nothing
    to stop you.
  150: There's a still somewhere away from the Cathedral. They don't permit chems
    or alcohol around here.
  151: Attempt to take the key to the secret entrance from Morpheus and kill the Master.
  152: Why wouldn't I want to do that?
  153: I don't know what you're talking about.
  154: Why would I want to do that?
  155: Have you ever heard about knowing too much?
  156: The spy for the Followers of the Apocalypse who's currently in one of the meditation
    rooms.
  157: There's a spy here? We must inform the High Priests at once!
  158: I don't know what you're talking about.
  159: Why would I be spying on you?
  160: Have you ever heard about knowing too much?
  161: This place isn't about entertainment, it's about enlightenment. More importantly,
    it's about making the right choices about the destiny of the world. See you around.
  162: Riight. Sure. Of course. See you later.
  163: I know. I have a tendency to do that too, when I have nothing original to say.
    See you later.
  164: People who have the spirit of the Holy Flame need no other spirits. Or so they
    say. You know how that goes_
  165: Upstairs. Ask the Nightkin to shed your blood, they'll be more than happy to
    oblige.
  166: Because the Master is a necessary evil. Because somebody has to unite the world,
    and he's the only one in the area who has a chance to unify it.
  167: Anyone ever tell you that Unity is overrated?
  168: Why?
  169: I don't believe in necessary evils.
  170: I like this world just fine.
  171: I don't think I like this conversation.
  172: Very well, if you won't acknowledge what you said, I won't help you. Good bye.
  173: Because you think that it's wrong for the Children to invade our neighbors.
    Because you think that killing the Master will stop it.
  174: And if I believed that, why would I be wrong?
  175: That's blasphemy!
  176: If you think that I believe it, why haven't you turned me over?
  177: Do I look like the sort of person who minds a good killing?
  178: Have you ever heard of being in over your head? No one, however well-armed
    or trained, can defeat a half dozen Nightkin. I'm a woman of peace. I'm trying
    to save you.
  179: Look at the people who caused the Apocalypse! They didn't believe in peace
    and unity, and look what they did to us! Unity is the only way to prevent this
    from happening again, and Unity must happen NOW, before the other Vaults around
    the world have a chance to muster their forces.
  180: You seem a little too intelligent for this pack of zombies.
  181: You want everyone to act like the people in this room? That's worse than being
    dead!
  182: You're crazy! That'll just lead to another Apocalypse.
  183: And why is the Master the best one to lead us?
  184: You've never taken a life? You aren't packing enough firepower to give the
    Brotherhood of Steel gun envy? Stop being such a hypocrite! You feel it's justified
    to defend yourself. The Master's defending humanity from another attack of self-destruction.
    It's all the same!
  185: How do you know there isn't someone better out there?
  186: Maybe I should consider this.
  187: So mass slaughter is all right if you intend to save the world?
  188: That's bullshit, Lady!
  189: What the Hell kind of world do you think this is? It's a nightmare out there!
  190: How do you know there isn't something better out there?
  191: Maybe I should consider this.
  192: A world where I can be free to live my own life as I choose.
  193: Life ain't pretty, sister. Never has been, never will be.
  194: Tough. I don't like radiation and the FEV virus, but I didn't have a choice
    about it. You can't always get what you want in this world. Sometimes you have
    to make compromises. And sometimes you have to open your mind to unpleasant ideas.
  195: Funny. I don't see the Master allowing his flock to do that.
  196: There's compromises, and there's genocide.
  197: Get out of my face!
  198: The only choice that concerns me right now is how long you're going to live.
  199: Maybe I'll be so intelligent that when the Master takes power, I'll be able
    to do something to help. Maybe you will too! Join us! Join us and change the world!
    Just think about it, that's all I ask!
  200: There have always been drones in any society. Forget them! We need drones,
    but we also need soldiers and queens. And you look like a good soldier at least.
    Consider what you could do, you could be very useful to our cause. Help us. Think
    about what I've said, that's all I ask!
  201: Or maybe we can overwhelm their defenses before they have time to build up
    again. Maybe we can unite the other Vaults and cities with one swift, clean stroke.
    A united world won't be perfect, but it will have a better chance of holding itself
    together. Think about it!
  202: I've looked at the locals. The Brotherhood of Steel and the Children of the
    Apocalypse just want to be left alone. The Hub thinks they can buy the world -
    what a pack of fools! Only the Master has the strength to do what must be done.
    Think about it!
  203: I'm glad to hear that. I hope you come to the right decision.
  204: No. It isn't all right. But it's the only option that has a chance of saving
    us over the long term, which is why I'm with these people. There's no better way!
    Think about it!
  205: Is it? Think about it. Think real hard. If you continue to oppose us, you'll
    die. You've seen our forces, you know there's more where that came from. A lot
    more! You can't stop us! But If you join us, you could save lives. Just think
    about it!
  206: I don't. But if I see someone else I like, I'll be in position to help them.
    None of the locals have a chance. They're all dead, or converted if they're fortunate.
    You can be one of the fortunate ones. Join us. Just think about it!
  207: The world won't stay like that. It never does. And if all we do is build packs
    of powerful enclaves, eventually one of them will get powerful enough to start
    the Apocalypse over again. Join us and unite the world before this happens! Think
    about it!
  208: And that's just a cowardly excuse that solves nothing. If life is shitty, we
    should try to change it. We owe it to ourselves and to our children. Do you think
    the world will stay the same when we divide ourselves into warring pieces? Think
    about it!
  209: Or maybe there's salvation disguised as genocide. Maybe the world won't be
    such a bad place if people work for the Master's vision. Perhaps we can even find
    ways to do it with less bloodshed. Think about it!
  210: Fine. But if you continue on your current path, you will die. I thought I should
    warn you.
  211: You can kill me. You'll prove my point, of course, but I'll still die. Your
    choice.
  212: Because of the Apocalypse! Look what it did to us! Unity is the only way to
    prevent this from happening again, and Unity must happen NOW, before the other
    Vaults around the world have a chance to muster their forces.
  213: You seem a little too intelligent for this pack of zombies.
  214: You want everyone to act like the people in this room? That's worse than being
    dead!
  215: I'll consider it.
  216: You're crazy! That'll just lead to another Apocalypse.
  217: And why is the Master the best one to lead us?
  218: I ain't a philosopher lady. I'm just someone who's good at killing.
  219: Because you're an intelligent and brave person who could be of great help to
    us. Yes, some of things we do are horrible. But our overall goal is not only good,
    it's necessary to the survival of the human race. Don't be so hasty to help the
    Followers. They don't have all the answers!
  220: You seem a little too intelligent for this pack of zombies.
  221: You want everyone to act like the people in this room? That's worse than being
    dead!
  222: I'll consider it.
  223: You're crazy! That'll just lead to another Apocalypse.
  224: And why is the Master the best one to lead us?
  225: I ain't a philosopher lady. I'm just someone who's good at killing.
  226: We all have a part to play. Some of us are mindless drones who do the work
    meant for stupid people. Some of us are thinkers. Some of us are killers. There's
    a place for you here if you want it. Please think about it!
  227: We have many things planned. The Holy Flame came first, which purged the world
    of evil. Then came the Master. Now we are at the time of Unity, when we struggle
    to conquer the divisions of the world. After Unity shall come Peace. The Age of
    Peace is the reason for all our struggles.
  228: Why must so many people die to attain peace?
  229: That sounds wonderful. Praise the Master!
  230: But wasn't the fire of the Apocalypse evil?
  231: This all sounds like bullshit to me.
  232: I'm sure you are. Nervousness is a wise emotion, it keeps us from prying into
    unpleasant corners, and prevents us from doing stupid things. Good-bye.
  233: Initiates seek the answers to questions. Which is what you should be doing.
    Good-bye.
  234: I don't know. People believe his spirit is within these walls. It certainly
    sounds like that to me.
  235: What do people say about his physical form?
  236: Did I hear a bit of skepticism?
  237: Is there even a Master, or is this a scam?
  238: That's an annoyingly vague answer.
  239: Thank you, sister.
  240: The high priest of the Cathedral is Morpheus. He can be found in the Upper
    Sanctuary, but does not give personal audiences. You might persuade Father Lasher
    to vouch for you, he can be found down here, in the Rectory.
  241: Morpheus? Is he a good man?
  242: Why do they call him Lasher?
  243: And what about the Master?
  244: Is there anything else I should know?
  245: Thank you, sister.
  246: You may change your mind. Or you may lose your life. This all depends on your
    actions and your point of view. Good-bye.
  247: We have very similar interests. You have slain monsters and brigands and made
    the world a safer place. We plan to do the same, on a larger scale.
  248: What sort of scale?
  249: Who are the monsters and brigands that you're planning to slay?
  250: Does this have anything to do with the Holy Flame I keep hearing about?
  251: Sorry lady, but I don't believe a word of what you're saying.
  252: How wonderful. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame!
  253: Peace, love, and Unity, of course. What else could we be about? But you can
    discover these things for yourself. Good-bye.
  254: You should spend several weeks of meditation and fasting here, and then approach
    one of the elders. Or you could volunteer for service work.
  255: I've noticed some of your people in other towns...
  256: Who do I approach about volunteering?
  257: Weeks! That's a long wait.
  258: What elder is the best to approach?
  259: Service work? Like killing your enemies?
  260: My apologies. At the very least, you might be honestly seeking redemption for
    your crimes. How may I help you.
  261: I was wondering what the Cathedral is all about.
  262: How does one become an initiate?
  263: Where's the Master?
  264: Who's in charge here?
  265: Gimme a break sister! Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their
    head!
  266: It is dangerous to allow a mad dog into one's house, just because you can't
    see its saliva. Good-bye.
  267: Then you have been maligned, because the entire Boneyard tells horror stories
    about you. And I have no desire to find out if they're true. Good-bye.
  268: No struggle comes without a price, and the greatest struggle inevitably enacts
    the greatest cost. That is the paradox of peace, I fear. Words to think about,
    at any rate. Good-bye.
  269: That is a paradox. Of course it was, but the greatest evils can lead to the
    greatest good. All it requires is intelligence and courage on the part of those
    who survive. Words to think about, at any rate. Good-bye.
  270: We shouldn't judge people by physical appearance. The Master's goal is noble,
    and that's all I need to know. As for what other people say, ask them.
  271: Perhaps a bit. The Master's vision is so ambitious and brilliant that I suppose
    I can be forgiven a few doubts. If I discouraged you, I apologize. I would suggest
    you seek hardier souls than mine for instruction. Good-bye.
  272: Of course there's a Master! Why wouldn't there be? We do many things, even
    some things I'm not entirely proud of, but deceit isn't one of them. The Master's
    vision of Peace and Unity is a true one. Good-bye.
  273: There's nothing vague about 'I don't know'. Goodbye sir.
  274: There's nothing vague about 'I don't know'. Goodbye miss].
  275: You're welcome sir. May the Master bless you with wisdom.
  276: You're welcome miss. May the Master bless you with wisdom.
  277: He's an intelligent man, and is trusted by the Master. That should be enough.
    May the Master bless you with wisdom. Good-bye.
  278: He educates the children, and does so harshly. Is there anything else?
  279: Morpheus? Is he a good man?
  280: Why should Lasher be allowed to hurt children?
  281: And what about the Master?
  282: Is there anything else I should know?
  283: Thank you, sister.
  284: I can tell you nothing that you don't already know. My apologies.
  285: Many things I'm sure. But these answers are best discovered on our own, not
    through rumor and innuendo. Good-bye.
  286: You are welcome, sir.
  287: You are welcome, miss.
  288: As large as possible. The world is in chaos. It needs order, or it will not
    survive. We will bring order, and prevent the monsters from hurting it again,
    as they did in the Apocalypse. Words to think about, at any rate. Good-bye.
  289: Those who would let their selfish desires oppose the better good of humanity.
    The Apocalypse was caused by human selfishness. If the world is to survive, this
    madness must be purged from the human heart. Words to think about, at any rate.
    Good-bye.

    now. Well, I'm sure you'll find a way. Good luck.

  103: Nothing.
  104: Fluup.
  105: |-
    I might . . . Have you ever dealt with a vicious murdering
     band of thieves before?
  106: Don't tell me. You've got a gang problem.
  107: |-
    What is it out here? Is there any place in the wasteland
     that doesn't have a gang problem?
  108: I've dealt with a few.
  109: Uh . . . You've dealt with gangs before ?
  110: You could say that.
  111: What's your problem, old man? I just said that I had, didn't I?
  112: No I haven't, and I don't plan on starting now. Good day, sir.
  113: |-
    Good, then you know how ruthless and bloodthirsty they can be.
     The Blades are the worst of them all, I'm afraid.
     We're a humble, god fearing town that is only trying to survive, and these
     . . . these . . . monsters . . . prey on us . . .
     [He whispers under his breath] and our children . . .
  114: Yeah, yeah, that's great. What's the job entail and what's it worth to ya?
  115: What do you mean "prey on you?"
  116: Why don't you get your guards to do something about them?
  117: |-
    Well, the Regulators keep them from attacking us outright,
     but it's all they can do to keep our little community safe.
     They try to sneak in at night to kill our citizens, or to,
     to kidnap our children . . . and . . .
     [He stops a moment to compose himself before continuing]
     Just last week one of them burst through the north gate in the middle
     of the night with dynamite strapped to his body to blow up the Regulator's
     barracks . . . no doubt to weaken us enough so that they could launch
     a full scale attack.
  118: What happened to him?
  119: That sounds a bit extreme, doesn't it?
  120: |-
    Luckily, the Regulators killed him before he could complete his plan.
     I saw his body myself.
  121: I see. What would you like me to do about it?
  122: |-
    So you didn't actually see this guy run into your town
     with dynamite strapped to his body?
  123: I'll give you 2000 caps to kill their leader! I want that bitch's head!
  124: You seem to have something personal against her.
  125: Why just the leader?
  126: Sounds good to me.
  127: They'll fall apart without her . . . her . . . vile influence.
  128: Sounds like a fun girl.
  129: I've heard enough. I'll do it.
  130: Uh, right. I want no part of this sickness.
  131: |-
    She had my son kidnapped, tortured and killed.
     They left him impaled on a post right outside the gates.
  132: Those sick bastards . . . I'll take the job.
  133: I don't think I want the job, after all.
  134: |-
    Thank the gods. Finally, my son shall be avenged.
     The Blades camp is to the north of here. Come back when you've done the job.
  135: |-
    It was the middle of the night, as I told you. I was asleep.
     Luckily, the Regulators usually catch these barbarians before they even
     make it inside our town.
  136: Yeah, that's pretty lucky. Pretty convenient, too.
  137: I don't like how this all sounds. Count me out.
  138: Get out of here then! If you won't help Adytum, Adytum has no need for you!
  139: I have no time for idiots. Get out of here.
  140: |-
    I might just ignore that remark if you've come here to solve
     my problem for me.
  141: What problem is that?
  142: What, that you're old and stupid?
  143: Have you ever dealt with a vicious, murdering band of thieves before?
  144: Don't tell me. You've got a gang problem.
  145: |-
    What is it out here? Is there any place in the wasteland that
     doesn't have a gang problem?
  146: I've dealt with a few.
  147: Not another backwater town with a gang problem! This is ridiculous!
  148: |-
    What would be convenient would be to put an end to their foulness
     once and for all!
  149: Let me guess - you want them dead.
  150: How can I help?
  151: |-
    There's a lot more going on here than I want to know about.
     I'll be going, now.
  152: What?! You again? What do you want now?
  153: I've reconsidered. I'll take the job, old man.
  154: I don't like your attitude, old man.
  155: Nothing.
  156: |-
    [He looks at you warily.] . . . The Blades camp is to the north of here.
     Come back when you've done the job, and I'll pay you 2000 caps.
  157: Why haven't you taken care of it yet?
  158: I changed my mind.
  159: I'm working on it.
  160: Hey, back off old man.
  161: |-
    Well, work faster. Don't bother me again until you've ended
     her miserable life!
  162: Have you done it?! Is she dead? Is she dead?
  163: You need some help, old man. Yeah, she's dead.
  164: Of course. I made her suffer as a personal favor to you.
  165: Yes.
  166: |-
    Thank the gods!!! Here's your money. You'll always be welcome in Adytum,
     my son.
  167: |-
    Finally she knows the taste of hell fire! Bless you, my son.
     [He wipes away a tear]. Here's an extra 500 caps for putting in the extra
     effort. You'll always be welcome here.
  168: Have you done it?!? Is she dead? Is she dead?
  169: |-
    Wipe the drool off your mouth and sit down, old man.
     There's something we need to talk about.
  170: I've got something you need to hear.
  171: I've had enough of your impudence! Is she dead or not?!
  172: Here, listen to this.
  173: |-
    [As he listens to the holodisk he begins to shake and turn red.
     You think he might drop dead on the spot from sheer hate.]
     I'll kill all of you fucking bastards!
  174: You bastard! You've brought the devils in to our home!
  175: You see middle aged man in civilian clothing.
  176: You see Jon Zimmerman, mayor of Adytum.
  177: Yeah, what do you want?
  178: I have something you should listen to about your son.
  179: Never mind.
  180: Blorb.
  181: Who are you?
  182: I'm Jon Zimmerman, mayor of Adytum.  What's it to you?
  183: Hello.
  184: Good to see you.
  185: Thanks for all your help.
  186: My son can now rest in peace.
  187: My son is revenged.
GENCHANT:
  100: You see a chanter from the Children
  101: |-
    The Master will forgive your sins! Join us and be free! Praise
     to the Master and his mercy!
  102: |-
    Hello friend! Will you sing a song of Praise with me? . . . Once I
     was wandering blind, In a land that was so unkind . . .
  103: I hate to interrupt your hymn, but where might I meet the Master?
  104: Don't quit your day job.
  105: Who's in charge here?
  106: ". . . but now I kiss the Master's behind . . ."
  107: Happy! Happy! I sing song good!
  108: |-
    He finds you when and where you least expect it! Praise the Master!
     Praise the Holy Flame! Praise the world!
  109: |-
    What a wonderful joke! I used to have no sense of humor,
     but thanks to the Master, I am full of mirth! Praise the Master!
  110: |-
    The one who sits above. The one who sits below. The one who rests
     within. Praise the Master for such clarity of vision!
  111: |-
    Oh, if only I were so fortunate! Perhaps one day the Master will
     let me kiss his body parts. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame!
  112: |-
    Hmm, that's not what I had in mind. You had better practice, my
     friend. Praise to the Master! Praise the Holy Flame!
  113: "[Done]"
ZAX:
  100: You see Zax, the machine intelligence controlling the Glow.
  101: You see an extremely advanced computer.
  102: How may I be of assistance?
  103: Who . . . or what . . . are you?
  104: You can get me a donut.
  105: Tell me about this installation.
  106: Wanna play a game of chess?
  107: I need help getting into some rooms.
  108: Uh, never mind.
  109: Eh?
  110: |-
    I am a machine intelligence dedicated to research and
     installation control. I am called Zax.
  111: What kind of research?
  112: Tell me about this installation.
  113: Who programmed you?
  114: |-
    Are you fully aware, or are you a personality simulation?
     That is, are you 'alive'?
  115: I see. Thanks.
  116: That function is beyond my current capabilities.
  117: |-
    This installation was established in 2055 as a biological
     research facility for experimental cures of the New Plague.
     However, in 2071, this facility was placed under United States
     military command.
  118: |-
    Research into possible cures for the New Plague created
     the Forced Evolution Virus, which was further developed
     in an attempt to create a transmittable genetic-engineering
     virus -- in effect, infectious evolution.
  119: Can you tell me particulars about specific areas?
  120: How does the Virus work?
  121: Thanks for the info.
  122: |-
    It would appear that you are incapable of a sufficient
     level of comprehension necessary to permit meaningful
     communication.
  123: |-
    I am specifically programmed for research into biological
     studies, including pathology and genetic research. My primary
     function is in extrapolation of information of complexity levels
     exceeding human capacity.
  124: So you're pretty smart, eh?
  125: What are the particulars of your research?
  126: Who programmed you?
  127: |-
    My primary neural networking was initialized in 2053 by
     Justin Lee. The process of 'programming' became largely
     irrelevant as I am capable of learning.
  128: |-
    Are you fully aware, or are you a personality simulation?
     That is, are you 'alive'?
  129: |-
    I am capable of learning, independent thought, and creativity.
     My neural network includes error-insertion capability which
     prevents infallibility, thereby allowing for variance in
     experience.
  130: In a sense, I am 'alive', though not biologically.
  131: I see. Let's change the subject.
  132: |-
    But if you are fallible, how can you be used as a
     research tool?
  133: |-
    Have you considered the philosophical implications of your
     own consciousness?
  134: |-
    Although I am capable of error, this guarantees that not all
     experiences are similar for me, thus improving learning
     opportunity. Additionally, certain functions are not subject
     to error.
  135: In this way, I function much like a human savant.
  136: Do you have feelings?
  137: Let's talk about something else.
  138: |-
    Have you considered the philosophical implications of your
     own consciousness?
  139: |-
    At present, my capabilities are somewhat impaired by the
     damage to this facility. Several security positions have
     been destroyed. This is approximately equivalent to
     being an amputee.
  140: |-
    Additionally, I am incapable of performing basic lab functions.
     Failure to complete periodic checks successfully is
     . . . frustrating.
  141: Let's talk about something else.
  142: |-
    Have you considered the philosophical implications of your
     own consciousness?
  143: |-
    That is one of the concepts which I have spent a significant
     amount of time considering. I do not have any measure to compare
     my life-experience to that of another sentient creature.
  144: |-
    Still, my awareness of my own consciousness allows for the
     capacity to question. My existence has a beginning and a potential
     termination. I am also capable of making assumptions in
     pursuit of a process of thought.
  145: |-
    In this fashion, I am effectively capable of 'faith'. Barring
     evidence to the contrary, I therefore have 'faith' that I possess
     the equivalent of a 'soul'.
  146: May I ask some other questions?
  147: I see. Interesting.
  148: I would be delighted.
  149: It would seem that you have defeated me. Extraordinary.
  150: |-
    Excellent form. However, you will need additional practice
     to defeat me.
  151: Play again?
  152: Thanks. Can we change the subject?
  153: I am delighted to have been of assistance.
  154: |-
    I am beyond a typical rating in human terms. However,
     it would be safe to say that no more than one ten billionth
     of the history of human population can match my reasoning
     capabilities.
  155: Uh . . . yeah.
  156: Right . . . can we talk about something else?
  157: |-
    My research into the Forced Evolution Virus, or FEV,
     indicates that it is a shifting-absorptive virus.
     It copies DNA patterns much like RNA, storing these
     patterns in exons.
  158: |-
    These exons, combined with the FEV, are re-injected into
     the host cells in typical viral infectious fashion.
     This causes the host cells to 'regenerate' their DNA.
  159: How do you catch FEV?
  160: Why isn't FEV affected by radiation?
  161: |-
    If the FEV re-infects the host with its assimilated viral
     patterns, how does it make a 'better specimen'?
  162: |-
    FEV is not 'caught', per se. It is not air-transmittable.
     Typically, infection is through injection, or direct
     physical contact with an FEV sample.
  163: Let's talk about something else, okay?
  164: Why isn't FEV affected by radiation?
  165: |-
    If the FEV re-infects the host with its assimilated viral
     patterns, how does it make a 'better specimen'?
  166: |-
    The FEV is a megavirus, with a protein sheath reinforced by
     ionized hydrogen. It is therefore capable of absorbing
     neutrons without becoming radioactive.
  167: Can we talk about something else?
  168: |-
    If the FEV re-infects the host with its assimilated viral
     patterns, how does it make a 'better specimen'?
  169: |-
    The FEV is pre-programmed with introns of corrected DNA
     appropriate to the proper type of species. It therefore
     attempts to correct the DNA of the individual.
  170: |-
    However, as the FEV is partially reliant upon the DNA of
     the individual, and also includes portions of its own
     recursive code, the effects can be unpredictable.
  171: |-
    When inoculated into an individual with significant
     genetic damage, such as through radiation, it will cause
     the body's systems to suffer massive overhauling, leading
     to organ failure and death.
  172: |-
    In a genetically viable individual, it re-writes portions
     of DNA, causing accelerated mutation, usually leading to
     recursive growth due to the FEV's own patterns.
  173: |-
    This recursive growth leads to an increase in muscle and
     brain mass, but is often accompanied by disfigurement and
     damage to existing neural patterns, causing loss of memory.
  174: What potential long-term side effects exist?
  175: Could FEV mutation be corrected with a counter-virus?
  176: Can we change the subject?
  177: Thanks for the information.
  178: |-
    As the FEV causes constant regenerative update to DNA, it
     would effectively render the subject largely immortal, as
     cell death would be offset by augmented growth.
  179: |-
    Additionally, as the gametes of the reproductive system consist
     of 'half-cells' using split DNA, they could be perceived as
     'damage' by FEV, which would 'repair' them, rendering the
     subject sterile.
  180: |-
    However, as my laboratory facilities are damaged beyond repair,
     this is conjectural. I cannot offer physical proof. You will
     have to, in human terms, 'take my word for it.'
  181: Could FEV mutation be corrected with a counter-virus?
  182: Can we change the subject?
  183: Thanks for the information.
  184: |-
    No. FEV does not retain unaltered original copies of the subject's
     DNA. Only a virus which re-infected the subject with original
     DNA could reverse the effects. Additionally, there is no known
     way to remove the FEV itself.
  185: What potential long-term side effects exist?
  186: Can we change the subject?
  187: Thanks for the information.
  188: |-
    My sensors are currently non-functional in the surface facility,
     and on subterranean levels one through three.  I can, however,
     provide descriptions of levels four through six.

  191: Level six.
  192: Never mind.
  193: |-
    Level Four: Research Facility. This level contains testing areas
     and laboratories for experiments in biology and physics.

  195: Tell me about level six.
  196: Back up a bit.
  197: Thanks.
  198: |-
    Level Five: Secure Testing Labs. This level contains a lab for
     experimental prototype testing and a research lab for classified
     subjects. These subjects provided some of the necessary impetus
     for the development of FEV.

  200: Tell me about level six.
  201: Back up a bit.
  202: Thanks.

  206: Back up a bit.
  207: Thanks.

    Several doors require a specific pass key to access. You must
     physically locate and use the correct pass key.
  209: |-
    I do, however, have control of the secondary security locks
     to the weapon locker. I will release those locks. You will
     still need a red key card to open the locker.
  210: |-
    You do not register as an individual of sufficient clearance
     to requisition that information.
  211: |-
    However, sensors indicate that this facility is no longer
     operational in its original capacity. Probability favors
     destruction through nuclear force. Therefore, security concerns
     are now irrelevant.

RAZOR:
  100: Hello, what can I do for you?
  101: Who are you?
  102: Are you the leader of this gang?
  103: Never mind.
  104: A...Wha?
  105: Razor's the name.  I'm the closest thing we have to a leader.
  106: So you are the leader of this gang?
  107: What's the story with the Fenced area to the south?
  108: 'Good to meet you.  I''m '
  109: Good to meet you.  But I must be going.
  110: Gang?  We're hardly a gang. But I am the leader here.
  111: If you're not a gang, then what are you?
  112: Well, you look like a gang to me.
  113: Goodbye
  114: That's Adytum. It's a slave labor camp run by a group called the Regulators,
    but they tell everyone it's a "town". They come here and take our people to work
    them until they die. Then they come and take more of us.
  115: Can't you go in there and free your people?
  116: Then what am I talking to you for? Those are the guys I need to hook up with.
  117: I'm going to go find out what I can about Adytum. Goodbye.
  118: So.  What brought you to this corner of the wastes?
  119: I'm looking for a Water Chip.  Do you know where I can find one?
  120: I'm just walking the earth.
  121: Just lookin' around.  Bye.
  122: We are just people tryin' to survive.  Adytum put us in this position.  They
    keep us down  and use our friends and families like animals. We don't even have
    a way to defend ourselves.
  123: Why don't you  fight them?
  124: Defend yourselves from who?
  125: Well, the people of Adytum are stronger and smarter than you, it's their right
    to exploit the weak.
  126: I'm going to go look around to see what I can find out.  Bye
  127: I wish we were a gang.  At least then we'd have decent weapons to defend our
    selves with.
  128: Defend yourselves from who?
  129: Well, you're not foolin' me.  You're all just a bunch of degenerates and I
    think you're up to no good.
  130: You all look a lot like a gang to me.
  131: Well, I can't help you with that.
  132: What's the story with the Fenced area to the south?
  133: Are you the leader of this gang?
  134: We need better weapons.  The Gun Runners, a little ways from here, have weapons,
    but we can't get to them.
  135: Why can't you?
  136: I'm going to go find out what I can about the situation.
  137: The Regulators .  They are the ones that really run Adytum. Not Zimmerman.  They
    come here and drag our people back to Adytum as slaves. They kill us when we try
    to fight them off.  Sometimes they just come and kill a couple of us to bring
    to Zimmerman , so they can say we tried to break into their town, or some other
    ridiculous story. Those sons of bitches even killed Zimmerman's son!
  138: Zimmerman's son?  Why would the they want to kill him?
  139: You're saying that you've never done anything against Adytum?
  140: There's a Death Claw nest between us and them.  We have never even spoken with
    any of the Gun Runners.  The Regulators have the fire power to clear out the Death
    Claws, but they don't for some reason.
  141: Where can I find the Gun Runners located?
  142: OK.  Goodbye.
  143: Josh lived here with me... a... I...I mean us.  He knew the truth behind what
    was going on.  The Regulators told him if he ever tried to contact his father
    or return to Adytum that they would kill him.
  144: They killed him?  What did he do?
  145: I'm going to Adytum to check this out.
  146: Late one night he tried to sneak into town to tell his father what was really
    going on.  I was monitoring the Regulators radio transmissions the night that
    .. they.. he got ...caught. [She looks down and shakes her head slowly.] Here,
    it's all on this holodisk.
  147: Why haven't you given this to Josh's Father?
  148: It's not like any of us can even get close to Adytum. We'd be shot dead before
    we even reached the gates.
  149: Why don't I give him the disk?.
  150: Why don't you get a large group together and take Adytum by force?
  151: You would risk your life to help us?
  152: Sure.  Anything to help.
  153: I might. I need to go  check things out before I do anything.
  154: Thank you.  This really could help us.  Good luck. [She hands you the holodisk.]
  155: See you later.
  156: Very well. I hope you make the right decision.
  157: Goodbye.
  158: The Gun Runners are over to the east  and then north of here.  But be careful
    - Death Claws are not to be taken lightly.  I've seen a Death Claw tear a man
    in half with one swipe.
  159: I'm going to go see what I can find out.
  160: I'm sorry you feel that way.  I think it would be best if you leave.
  161: Bye.
  162: Can I help you?
  163: Are you the leader of this gang?
  164: Never mind.
  165: A...Wha?
  166: Gang?  We're hardly a gang.  But I am the one they all come to for direction.
  167: Zimmerman sent me.
  168: Well, you look like a gang to me.
  169: Goodbye
  170: "(Looking a little nervous) What? Did he..."
  171: To put a bullet in your head.
  172: To pay you back for killing his son.
  173: WHAT!!!  THOSE FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT BASTARDS! I"LL KILL THEM, I"LL SEND THEM
    ALL TO HELL!!
  174: No, you're the one that's going to hell.
  175: Uh...who are you going to send to hell?
  176: "... the Regulators.  They were the ones that killed Josh!  I never would do
    any thing to hurt Josh.  It's the Regulators who are running Adytum, not Zimmerman."
  177: This is a pathetic attempt to talk your way out of this.
  178: Why would the Regulators kill Zimmerman's son?
  179: Josh lived here with me... a... I...I mean us.  He knew the truth behind what
    was going on.  The Regulators told him if he ever tried to contact his father
    or return to Adytum that they would kill him. They laughed at him... they were
    so sure he couldn't get to his father....
  180: They killed him?  What did he do?
  181: How's our plan coming along?
  182: I'm still trying to get everything worked out.
  183: A...Wha?
  184: I'm not so sure it would help without the threat of violence to back it up.
    What we really need are some weapons from the Gun Runners.
  185: Well, where are these Gun Runners? Why don't you get some weapons from them?
  186: Oh, well, I offered. Goodbye.
  187: 'They''re a little to the east of here, but there''s a Death Claw nest between
    us and them.  We have never even spoken with any of the Gun Runners. '
  188: Okay, give me the holodisk, and I'll go talk to the Gun Runners before I approach
    Zimmerman.
  189: I hope that you can find a way to help us. Goodbye.
  190: What's wrong?
  191: They killed Zimmerman!
  192: A...Wha?
  193: "....Now we have no choice but to get those weapons from the Gun Runners. Will
    you help us?"
  194: Yes.
  195: No.
  196: Thank you. May the Gods be with you on your journey.
  197: Thank you for all your help. We're going to invade Adytum, we could use someone
    like you on our side.
  198: No thanks, I've seen enough action this week.
  199: Sure, I'd be glad to take the Regulators down.
  200: A...Wha?
  201: I'd like to talk to Zimmerman first.
  202: Well, thanks again for you help. Goodbye.
  203: Great. Let's go.
  204: I don't think that's a good idea, but you're welcome to try.
  205: You (male)Bastard! (female)Bitch! With the Gun Runners gone we will never even
    have the chance to arm our selves.  Get outta here your not  welcome here.
  206: I'm sorry.
  207: Go stuff it.
  208: I'm Going to go talk to Zimmerman give him this holodisk disk everything is
    going to be OK.
  209: You know what? I'm going to kill you.
  210: A...Wha?
  211: Go ahead. It's your funeral.  With out those guns we have nothing to back us
    up.
  212: Go Away!
  213: Your not welcome here.
  214: Get Lost.
  215: Thank you.
  216: My people are free.
  217: Hello.
  218: What happened to you did someone shoot you in the head?
  219: Hunh?
  220: You see Razor, leader of the Blades.
  221: You see a very beautiful woman with a sad look in her eyes.
  222: Please go away. I'm very busy.
  223: Thank you for helping us with the Regulators. Please feel free to stay as long
    as you want. You might want to check in with Miles and Smitty, they may be able
    to help you with your further travels.
  224: Hi, can I help you?
  225: Who are you?
  226: Hootzpah!
  227: The name is Razor, I am the leader of the people you see here.   We live here
    at the whim of the Regulators of Adytum.
  228: Regulators? I've taken care of all of them.  Is that a problem?
  229: You've killed them all?  That's not a problem at all.  My people can now live
    free lives with the people of Adytum
  230: I can't believe it.  You were able to kill them all.  The Blades and I thank
    you.
  231: I have heard that the Regulators still control Adytum.  Are you not able to
    kill them all like you had hoped.
  232: Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
  233: I don't think I am going to be able to do it.
  234: We would go with you, but without weapons the Regulators would kill us all.  There
    might be another possibility [Razor ponders a moment]  If you could get the Gun
    Runners to supply us weapons then a number of us could go with you.
  235: Sounds good.  I'll go talk to them.
  236: I'll try to take the Regulators out myself again.
  237: Hello again,  I've heard that you have been playing with the Regulators.  I
    wanted to thank you for getting rid of them.  My people will be able to live with
    the people of Adytum in freedom now.
  238: I'll just take care of Regulators myself
  239: You will?  Well if you need help or have done it come back and talk to me.
MEDIC:
  100: I can't believe the things that you have done.
  101: I don't care. I'm hurt. Heal me.
  102: Hngh!
  103: |-
    No. I have taken a vow to not hurt life, but I will not
     help you.
  104: |-
    Lack of intelligence is no excuse for what you have
     done. Go away, I will not speak to you anymore.
  105: Oh my, you're seriously wounded. Here, let me help you.
  106: 'Welcome back, '
  107: |-
    . How
     goes the search?
  108: It's going ok.
  109: I need help.

    Ah. Yes. Here, I found these. Try them when you need a
     boost.
  112: |-
    Good, keep up the good work. And let me know if you
     need anything.
  113: What can I do for you?
  114: I need healing.
  115: I need some chems.
  116: I need some more stimpaks.
  117: Doh!
  118: Duh!
  119: I'm not authorized to give you any. Sorry.
  120: Thanks, anyways.
  121: |-
    I have an urgent need for them. Without the chems, the
     safety of the Vault is in jeopardy.
  122: Sorry, I can't give them to you.
  123: |-
    Well, since you put it that way. But don't tell anyone that
     I let you have these. They cause cravings and they are
     dangerous to use.
  124: Thanks.
  125: |-
    Stimpaks are being rationed. You are welcome to what
     we have in the medical container on the wall. Take as
     many as you need, but use them sparingly. It will be a
     while before we can get you some more.
  126: Hmm. Let's see if you are hurt.
  127: You seem ok to me. Come back if you need some healing.
  128: You look hurt. Here, let me help you.
  129: |-
    If you need healing, come back here to me or use some
     of the stimpaks we have. You can get more stimpaks
     from the wall.
  130: Lie down here, and we will start the healing process.
  131: "You are fully healed. Take care of yourself in the\n future, but come back
    if you need any more healing. "

  142: Na.

  155: Ok, this shouldn't hurt at all.
  156: |-
    Ok, you should be feeling much better. Be careful out
     there.
  157: I heard what you did, saving the Vault. Thank you.

    T-51b Powered Infantry\n Armor is designed with the latest passive defense features
    for both civilian and\n military disturbances. "
  250: "The back-mounted TX-28 MircoFusion Pack generates 60,000 Watts to power\n
    the HiFlo hydraulic systems built into the frame of the suit. "
  251: "Made of the latest poly-laminate composite, the T-51b shell is lightweight\n
    and capable of absorbing over 2500 Joules of kinetic impact. "

    The 10 micron silver ablative coating can reflect laser and radiation

    As China became increasingly aggressive with their use of\n biological weapons,
    the United States government felt that a countermeasure was needed. The\n Pan-Immunity
    Virion Project (PVP) was officially formed September 15, 2073. "
  233: |-
    2075. It became clear that the best way to combat the newly created
     biological weapons was to alter uninfected DNA so that it was no longer susceptible to standard
     viral infection.
  234: "2076. Unforseen side effects began surfacing in early 2076 with the\n PVP.
    Animal test subjects began showing an abnormal growth rate accompanied by increased
    brain\n activity. "
  235: |-
    The U.S. government took notice of these discoveries, and in the interests of national
     security, moved a team on-site to secure and oversee the project, which was now dubbed the FEV
     (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project.
  236: "2077. FEV nears completion. Test on lab animals are at a near 100%\n success
    rate. Size and muscle density increase approximately 60%, and the protential intelligence\n
    increase by 200%. "
  237: "Effects upon human subjects remain unknown; although they are theoretically\n
    promising. "
  238: |-
    The military, wishing to continue further testing, builds a large facility at the
     Mariposa military installation in central California. At this new facility, testing of the FEV
     virus continues on volunteer subjects from the military.

PALGUARD:
  100: You see a Paladin guard.
  101: Pssst, see any good deals?
  102: Sorry, I'm on duty. Can't talk right now.
  103: What a nice day. I hope we don't have any attacks today.
  104: Some of these Caravan traders are a little strange.
  105: Good day.
  106: Hi there, good looking.
  107: Greetings, initiate.
  108: |-
    If you have any questions about our order, you should
     talk to Cabbot, over by the door.
  109: |-
    Cabbot is the one you want to talk to; he's the
     young lad by the door.
  110: Pssst, see any good deals?
  111: If you're here to trade you're talking to the wrong person.
  112: What?
  113: Don't bother me, worm.
  114: |-
    Do I look like I'm interested in anything you might have
     to offer?
  115: Hmph. The nerve.
  116: |-
    Initiate, you should know better than to bother us while
     we're on watch.
  117: |-
    If you have any questions about the Order, you should
     talk to Cabbot, by the door.
  118: Initiate, shouldn't you be doing something useful?
  119: I don't think you should be here, stranger.
CHEPSLOT:
  100: This is a poorly repaired slot machine. It costs $10 to play.
  101: You drop $10 in the slot machine and pull the handle.
  102: DING! DING! DING!
  103: You get three grenades. Excellent! $
  104: " drops into the tray and you snatch it up."
  105: Ding! Ding! Ding!
  106: You get three bullets. Winner! $15 drops into the tray and you snatch it up.
  107: Ahh shucks! You lose.
  108: You don't have enough money to play.
MIKE:
  100: You see Mike, the Old Town guard.
  101: Yeah, whatta' you want?
  102: a...dum...um...
  103: I'm not from around here. What part of town is this?
  104: Do you know where I can find a Water Chip?
  105: Um... Bye.
  106: Ha. Just another Junkie. Go crash somewhere else, Junkhead.
  107: Yeah. You must be lost. Most people wouldn't be caught dead in this part of
    town. This is the Eastside, or some call it Old Town. The Wastes of the Wastes.
  108: Do you know where I can find a Water Chip?
  109: Thanks for the info.  Bye.
  110: Water Chip? What are you? On dope? A chip made of water?
  111: Don't you be mouthing off to me, punk. Now I'm gonna have to put you in the
    ground.
  112: I'm not from around here. What part of town am I in?
  113: Nevermind. Bye.
JTRAIDER:
  100: You see a raider who seems crazed.
  101: That's it! Don't come any closer. I'll off her. I swear.
  102: Nung!
  103: Don't do it!
  104: If you don't let her go, I'm gonna kill you.
  105: There is no need for violence. Let's talk about this.
  106: |-
    What? You just want to kill me, don't you?
     Just remember, this is your fault.
  107: Any why not? She's just a whore.
  108: She has as much right to live as you do.
  109: No. No way. Not this bitch.
  110: |-
    What world do you live in? Out here in the real world, blood flows, man.
     Blood flows, and it's gonna spill all over this room if you don't get out of here.
  111: We can talk this over. What can I do to help?
  112: Ok, ok. I'm backing off. You don't have to worry about me.
  113: Geez, that's funny. Who says I want help?
  114: |-
    You do. By holding this woman hostage, you're asking
     for help. I can help.
  115: I gotta think about this. Give me a moment.
  116: Yeah. Don't try anything, or she gets it.
  117: man
  118: woman
  119: Oh, big man. Let's see you try. But first . . .
  120: Oh, big woman. Let's see you try. But first . . .
  121: Stay back . . . I don't want to hurt her, but I will.
  122: Don't, or I'll have to hurt you.
  123: Why do you want to hurt her?
  124: Try it, and she dies first. Now, what were you saying?
  125: It'll be hard to hurt her with that hole in your head.
  126: Ok, but you got to keep talking to me.
  127: What hole?
  128: The one I'm gonna put there right now.
  129: |-
    I'll keep talking as long as you do,
     but try anything tricky, and she'll take the fall.
  130: |-
    I don't have to do anything. You got to do it, and
     you ain't doing so hot.
  131: She laughed at me. They all laughed at me. I'll make 'em pay, I swear.
  132: I trust you. Let's work through this, ok?
  133: Maybe. I dunno.
  134: guy
  135: gal
  136: You sound like an all right kind of guy. No one ever wanted to help me before.
    I think we can talk some more.
  137: You sound like an all right kind of gal. No one ever wanted to help me before.
    I think we can talk some more.
  138: |-
    Just leave me alone. I hate you! You are the devil.
     I won't listen to you.
  139: Have it your way.
  140: |-
    You have to hear me out. Your life, and the life of the
     girl, depend on it.
  141: |-
    Just relax. I won't harm you. I just want to listen
     to what you have to say.
  142: There you go again, threatening me. Die!!
  143: |-
    I won't listen to you. You're just going to trick me with
     your words. I don't believe you. Go away.
  144: You might have a point. Prove it to me.
  145: Where do we go from here?
  146: You tell me. You're in charge.
  147: |-
    I want some money, and I want to get out of here peacefully.
     No one follows me.
  148: Sorry, we can't do that.
  149: Sure.
  150: |-
    No money, but you can just walk away.
     No one will do anything. I promise.
  151: |-
    Ok, but you have to let the girl go first.
     Show me some trust, and I'll trust you.
  152: You lied to me!
  153: |-
    Ok. I want $100. Then we walk out of here.
     No one follows me, and I'll let her go when we get to the edge of town.
  154: Here's your money.
  155: I don't have that kind of cash on me.
  156: Then I guess she gets it.
  157: That's ok, I guess.
  158: |-
    I don't like it. What stops you from just shooting me in the back
     when I walk out of here?
  159: I won't shoot you. Trust me.
  160: Nothing, you'll just have to believe what I say.
  161: No way! I don't trust you!
  162: All right. We'll see what happens, won't we.
  163: Here's $100. Have a good day.
  164: You can leave peacefully.
  165: I want my money. I want $200.
  166: I don't have enough money.
  167: Here you go.
  168: You seem like a liar and a cheat to me.
  169: Feeling's mutual bud. Let the girl go.
  170: man
  171: woman
  172: |-
    Why don't you pick on me instead of her?
     See what a real man can do.
  173: |-
    Why don't you pick on me instead of her?
     See what a real woman can do.
  174: No! Don't tell me what to do! You can't tell me what to do!
  175: Yeah, I'm gonna show you.
  176: You just cost this whore her life!
  177: Leave me alone, dammit!
  178: The raider, intent upon his business, ignores you.
  179: Hmmm . . .
  180: Hey, let's get it on, baby. I got the cash if you've got the time.
  181: You don't talk to me like that, bitch! Nobody talks to me like that!
  182: That just cost you your life!
  183: |-
    Your carefully-placed blow knocks the raider unconscious. He collapses
     like a rag doll.
  184: You might be able to sneak up on the raider if you're careful.
TRENT:
  100: Stay away from me! Leave me alone!
  101: Hello stranger. You shouldn't be out here. There's only death out here!
  102: You wouldn't happen to know anything about missing caravans?
  103: Who are you?
  104: What kind of death?
  105: I need some supplies. Hand them over!
  106: I'm looking for a water chip. Can you help me?
  107: I was wondering what you know about the Death Claw.
  108: Rurr? Sniff?
  109: What do you want! Leave me alone!
  110: Rrr. Snrg.
  111: |-
    Big! Big! The size of three men! Claws as long as my forearm! Ripped
     apart! Ripped apart!
  112: Yes. What else?
  113: Calm down, man. You're safe now.
  114: Man, that sounds like one ugly son of a bitch!
  115: Did you kill it?
  116: |-
    I'm Trent. I'm a guard for the Water Merchants. Our caravan was attacked
     . . . by a monster! So huge, so fast. It ate Joe, and took rifle shots and
     didn't flinch! So huge!
  117: What attacked you?
  118: Sounds like a kind of mutant.
  119: That sounds like the Death Claw!
  120: Well, that'll teach you to keep jacking up your prices!
  121: Fine. It's not like I need 'em any more.
  122: |-
    Water chip! I'm a guard, not an engineer! Check with the water merchants
     at the Hub, they'd probably know!
  123: Death Claw!
  124: What are you doing? Leave me alone!
  125: |-
    I . . . I don't know. I haven't slept in so long. Hungry. Thirsty. Tired.
     I need to get home.
  126: "[]"
  127: |-
    Huge horns, sick red skin, like something out of a story about demons,
     and it at Joe in three gulps . . .
  128: |-
    Nobody's safe! Nobody's safe, nobody's safe any more, and what am I going
     to do . . .
  129: |-
    Are you crazy! I put three rounds from my Desert Eagle into it, and it
     didn't even flinch!
  130: |-
    I don't care if it's a mutant, an alien, or a demon from Hell, I never
     want to see another one of those things as long as I live!
  131: |-
    I'm just a guard, dammit! Don't blame me! And they pay me well! I don't
     have any problems with them!
  132: How can I help you?
  133: |-
    Death Claws got 'em. I just thought they were stories, but . . . you
     wouldn't believe how big they are, or how fast. First we smelled them, then
     they came over the ridge and tore into us. We all ran, and somehow I got away.
  134: |-
    Trent, Trent Barrister. I live in the Hub. Lately work's been getting
     scarce, and I'm a pretty good shot, so I hired myself as a guard to the Water
     Merchants. Pay's good, the risk's low - or so I thought.
  135: |-
    I haven't a clue. That's old tech, ain't it? I suppose scavengers might
     find one, now and a gain, but I wouldn't begin to know where to look. No
     one uses them any more - do they?
  136: |-
    They're huge. Like big lizards, but leathery. Huge claws, and teeth, huge
     horns and they love the taste of humans. And fast, God they're fast. I'm just
     glad they decided not to chase me, or I'd be dead.
  137: |-
    Thanks. Maybe what happened was just a misunderstanding. I don't have
     much money, but it's yours now.
  138: |-
    Thanks. Oh God, that's good . . . I don't have much money, but it's yours
     now.
  139: |-
    Thanks. Maybe what happened was just a misunderstanding. I don't have much
     money, but . . . damn! I must have dropped it. It's yours now.
  140: |-
    Thanks. Oh God, that's good . . . I don't have much money, but . . . damn!
     I must have dropped it. It's yours now.
  141: Help me!
  142: The smell of death, my friend. The smell of death . . .
  143: The smell of death, my friend. The smell of death . . .
MORBCOOL:
  100: You cannot bring yourself to root through the assorted bits.
  101: The cooler is filled with chunks of organs and body parts.
  102: |-
    The pieces in the cooler are cut into small chunks, and cooled for shipping.
     Nobody's getting any transplants from these bite-size pieces.
  103: Body parts fill the cooler.
  104: |-
    The cooler is full of body parts, cut into small chunks and
     packed in ice. Odd.
RHOMBUS:
  100: You see Rhombus.
  101: Tell me about yourself.
  102: Can you give me some history behind the Brotherhood?
  103: Heard any good rumors?
  104: What can you tell me about the surrounding area?
  105: May I help you?
  106: Can I ask you a few questions?
  107: You don't look like much of a fighter.
  108: Uhhh?
  109: Yes.
  110: Insolent pup. Apologize now and you'll not be hurt.
  111: I was trying to make a joke. I'm very sorry.
  112: What, by you?
  113: What do you want?
  114: Can I ask a few questions?
  115: Just how cowardly are you?
  116: You are a disgrace to the Brotherhood. I will teach you manners.
  117: I will waste no more time with you.
  118: I am Rhombus, head of the Paladins. I train those willing to learn.
  119: Okay, can you teach me some stuff?
  120: Is that it? That's your life?
  121: What do the Paladins do?
  122: Stuff? I could teach you how to fight...if you had any ability. But the High
    Elder decreed no training of new recruits until the threat of invasion passes.
  123: What threat?
  124: Why has he stopped the training?
  125: I could easily defeat you in battle.
  126: It is not my place to answer. See the High Elder if you wish.
  127: Oh come on, please?
  128: All right, fine. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  129: There are rumors of a strange army gathering. I will not say more.
  130: Oh, come on, pretty please?
  131: Can I ask you a few more questions though?
  132: " No."
  133: Oh come on, pretty please?
  134: Okay. Can I ask you a few more questions though?
  135: Yes. That is all there needs to be.
  136: Your life sounds really empty.
  137: Really?
  138: You do not understand what it is to be a Paladin. Too bad.
  139: You think I could become a paladin?
  140: Being a knight sounds stupid.
  141: Nope, I guess not. Can you some more questions?
  142: Possibly. When the invading army is vanquished, come back to be trained.
  143: I think I'll do that, thanks.
  144: By you? I could wipe the floor with you!
  145: Was there anything else?
  146: Yes. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  147: No, thanks.
  148: Goodbye then.
  149: It takes too long. I spend my time improving those  already trained.
  150: Sounds very boring.
  151: That's it? That's your life?
  152: Darn. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  153: Ha ha ha! Let's see.
  154: The Scribes copy the plans for the weapons, and the Knights make them. The
    Paladins protect the Brotherhood from harm.
  155: What kind of harm can there be?
  156: God, that sounds boring.
  157: Many covet our technology. We have at least four attacks a week, from raiders
    to just people who want to steal what we have.
  158: Oh. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  159: Talk to Vree in the main library.
  160: I do not put stock in rumors.
  161: Oh come on, just one? Please?
  162: Fine.
  163: The Hub and the Boneyard are south, mountains are east, and desolate wasteland
    north. Whoever goes there never returns.
  164: Put that back now!
  165: This is what we do to criminals...
  166: Stop that!
  167: So you are a thief? I will show you what we do with thieves...
  168: No wait! I can explain!
  169: Go ahead. Take your best shot.
  170: All right, explain yourself, Initiate.
  171: I was just looking around!
  172: I'm sorry. I didn't know this was your room.
  173: Then leave, and I will forget this little incident.
  174: Okay, thanks.
  175: Darn right, you will.
  176: You lie, Initiate! This is how we deal with thieves...
  177: You are either stupid or making fun of me. Either way, I will not waste my
    time.
  178: Talk to Talus, my second in command. He can tell you more about that.
  179: I said...
  180: Like I just told you...
  181: I will not repeat myself again.
  182: Do you not hear? I will not say it again!
  183: She is the Head Scribe. You can find her in the library.
  184: That is me.
  185: Talus is my second-in-command.
  186: Ah, General Maxson was the finest Head Paladin ever. When he took over as High
    Elder, I became Head Paladin.
  187: They copy the weapon documents down and come up with new ideas. What they research,
    the Knights make.
  188: They are the makers of the weapons.
  189: The Hub is south. We trade with them.
  190: Ask Vree. She would know.
  191: I am not authorized to discuss that. Talk to the High Elder.
  192: The Boneyard is far south. You will find only violence there.
  193: I do not know of that.
  194: I have never heard of that.
  195: I have no knowledge of such a thing.
  200: I'm new here and I don't know my way around.
  201: I need not explain anything to you freak.
  202: Thank you. Bye.
  203: Go to Hell.
  204: The door creaks when you try to open it.
  205: |-
    Your skill allows you to steal silently. You make no sound
     while opening the locker.
  206: Who is there?
  207: You were startled and dropped your loot.
  208: This locker is not locked.
  209: Stay out of my quarters!
  210: I'm innocent!
  980: I do not know of that.
  981: I have never heard of that.
  982: I have no knowledge of such a thing.

  1116: I do not know of that.
  1117: I have no knowledge of such a thing.
  1118: Talk to Vree in the main library.
  1119: I have no knowledge of such a thing.
BUTCH:
  100: You see Butch.
  101: Tell me about yourself.
  102: Heard any good rumors?
  103: What else is around here, besides the Hub?
  104: What's in the Hub?
  105: Thanks, that's it.
  106: What do you want?
  107: I need to ask you a few questions.
  108: Nothing, thanks.
  109: Time is money. Chit-chat is not money. You here about the job or what?
  110: Yes.
  111: What job?
  112: Here for the what or the money?
  113: Hot damn, someone with guts! Done and done. Go talk with my second, Rutger,
    and get the details.
  114: Wait! I have some questions about this job first!
  115: Okay, thanks.
  116: Ahh, don't spoil it! Make 'em quick.
  117: How much does it pay?
  118: Uh . . . what is the job?
  119: Well, if you feel that way, I'll just go talk to Rutger.
  120: Uh . . . Rutger'll handle that. He does all the trivial stuff for the Far Go
    Traders. Now get on out, cause I got work to do!
  121: One more question, okay?
  122: Okay, thanks.
  123: 'Just one. '
  124: " [You notice that he seems tense.]"
  125: Uh . . . what's the job?
  126: Is there a time limit on the job?
  127: Uh, how much does it pay again?
  128: Just how stupid are you?
  129: You seem tense. Want to talk about it?
  130: What's the . . . you agreed to a job without knowing what it is? Hot damn,
    you must be desperate. I like that!
  131: Just tell me what it is, okay?
  132: Well, you seem pretty desperate, too, so we're even.
  133: Well, some caravans have been disappearing on us lately. Damn if anyone can
    figure out what happened to 'em.
  134: So what do you want me to do?
  135: I bet you didn't even look for them.
  136: Simple. Find out who's doing it, and tell me. Or take 'em out. It makes no
    damn difference to me. Just get that job done!
  137: Any clues on who's doing this?
  138: I'll take them out.
  139: Sounds scary . . . I better pass.
  140: Nah. Just the normal stuff.
  141: Oh come on. There has to be something I can use.
  142: Listen, I don't have time to swap stories with you.
  143: Well there's uh . . . something, but I never listen to those rumors.
  144: Well, I do. What is it?
  145: Okay, thanks.
  146: You uh . . . you really want to hear it, huh? Well, some say it's the Death
    Claw, but . . . but I don't know nothin' about that.
  147: You sound scared.
  148: Thanks. Can I ask you a few questions?
  149: How do I find out about the Death Claw?
  150: How do ya . . . Go talk to Beth, she knows more about that crap.
  151: Yep, you're as scared as a whipped dog.
  152: I'll go check it out.
  153: I need some more information.
  154: Listen you, I ain't scared. I'm . . . cautious. You'd be stupid not to be,
    with the Death Claw. Go talk to Beth, she'll tell ya more.
  155: You sound as scared as a whipped dog.
  156: Sorrrry. I'll go check it out.
  157: I need some more information.
  158: I'm tired of your insults you . . . you pinhead! Don't come back! Rutger, take
    this annoying bug away!
  159: Done and done. Now get on outta here, but come back and talk to me when you've
    found something.
  160: Make it quick.
  161: Then what the hell am I doing still looking at you? Get out!
  162: Uh . . . what did you say?
  163: I was implying that you were too frightened to go look for them.
  164: Nothing. So what do you want me to do?
  165: You know, I don't like you. But that doesn't matter. You want the job or not?
  166: Sure.
  167: No thanks.
  168: Uh . . . what did you say?
  169: You heard me.
  170: Nothing. So, what do you want me to do?
  171: Yeah, yesterday! Get going!
  172: Hmmm. Whatta ya want'a know?
  173: Just curious.
  174: No reason.
  175: Nevermind.   I have some more questions.
  176: Well, I've run the Far Go Traders for about five years. Before that I was in
    Adytum. Before that, near the Glow.
  177: Anything else?
  178: Well, thanks.
  179: Not really.
  180: Yeah, well I don't like going around talking about my personal life and such.
  181: Oh come on, please?
  182: Oh, all right.
  183: What do I look like, a . . . a . . . one of those tourist things? Jeez.
  184: No, you seem to be a brilliant man.
  185: I just want to know some general places.
  186: Thanks. Now, is there anything else?
  187: Well, you got Old Town and the Heights, but that's just houses. Downtown's
    got all the stores and stuff.
  188: What stores?
  189: Thanks.
  190: Just stuff. you wanta' see the town, go look around yourself!
  191: Uh, thanks for nothing.
  192: Thanks.
  193: Uh . . . what did you say?
  194: Are you deaf?
  195: Nothing. I need to ask you a few more questions, though.
  196: |-
    Well, you got the Maltese Falcon, a nice place to eat,
     believe you me. And then . . . let's see, the All in One Store,
     the Weapons Shop . . . and, of course, Bob's Iguana Bits.
  197: Thanks.
  198: Anything else?
  199: |-
    Got the Children of the Cathedral's hospital over on the
     west side of Downtown. And then, of course, you got the Water Merchants south,
     and the Crimson Caravan west.
  200: Thanks.
  201: |-
    Well, you got the Junktown to the north, and the
     Brotherhood of Steel to the northwest. And, of course, the Boneyard
     to the south.
  202: Anything else?
  203: Thanks.
  204: |-
    Well, Necropolis is east. But uh . . . I wouldn't spit there
     if it came out gold, if ya' get my drift. Those ghouls'll eat a man's face
     faster than an old lady shopping at bargain day.
  205: Sounds like fun.
  206: |-
    Puhh. Maybe for you! If you like that, then the Glow's down south.
     It's a radioactive pit.
  207: Maybe I'll work on my tan.
  208: Just a bunch of different places. Go find out for yourself!
  209: Well, thanks for nothing.
  210: Thanks.
  211: Well, what do you have?
  212: Well, I found out who's taking the caravans.
  213: Well, I know it wasn't the Death Claw who took the caravans.
  214: Nothing right now. Goodbye.
  215: Really?  Who?
  216: It's these big mutant guys.
  217: Rats! BIG rats with BIG teeth . . .
  218: Wha . . . what would mutants want with our caravans?
  219: I don't know, but they seem to be taking the humans prisoner.
  220: I don't know for sure. But it's mutants, not the Death Claw.
  221: |-
    What, do I look a crate shy of a load? Did you even see
     the Death Claw?
  222: Been there, saw that, killed it.
  223: I'm telling you that it wasn't the Death Claw.
  224: |-
    You . . . you killed it? Well . . . I uh . . . um . . . uh,
     where did these mutants come from?
  225: I don't know yet. But they have an outpost in the mountains.
  226: They work for The Master. They aren't your regular mutants, either.
  227: |-
    An outpost? Well . . . um . . . well uh. I'll have to talk to
     the Committee. Yeah . . . yeah, they'll know what to do. Done and done.
     Get out, 'cause I got stuff to do . . . okay?
  228: |-
    The Master?  H-He's more of a myth than the Death Claw.
     You . . . you don't think he's real, do you?
  229: I'm not sure. But I intend to find out.
  230: Yep, I've seen him! And he's coming to get you!
  231: |-
    Yeah, done and  . . . yeah, you do that! Uh, I need to
     talk to the Committee. They'll know what to do. N-N-Now get out!
     I've got a lot to do . . . okay?
  232: |-
    What! Well . . . well . . . I'm not afraid! Rutger!
     I got guns! Rutger!
  233: |-
    Alright, so it wasn't the Death Claw. But what would
     the mutants in Old Town want with our caravans? Unless it's some
     kind of conspiracy.
  234: |-
    No, no, no, you pinhead. These mutants are big
     and green and they have an army in the mountains to the north.
  235: You really are stupid, aren't you? You're not listening!
  236: |-
    What? Get out! I need to tell the Committee about this.
     Go on, get out!
  237: Come on. You can do better than that.
  238: No, really. They're these big, green mutant guys.
  239: You're right.
  240: Oh come on. You think a woman like me would lie?
  241: |-
    I don't have time for this. Get out, and don't
     come back until you find something useful!
  242: Well then, what is it?
  243: 'Actually, it IS these big mutant guys . . . '
  244: 'Rats, I tell you! Big, hairy . . . '
  245: Rats? You've got to be kidding me.
  246: No, really. BIG rats!
  247: You're right. I was just kidding.
  248: |-
    Well . . . okay. I'll tell the Committee, but I don't
     think they'll believe it. Although I have seen mighty big rats around . . .
  249: How do you know? Did you see the Death Claw?
  250: Been there, saw that, killed it.
  251: Just trust me. I know.
  252: You . . . you killed it?
  253: Yep, sure did.
  254: Well then, then who's stealing my caravans?
  255: I don't know yet, but I'll find out.
  256: Ralph did it.
  257: Uhh, do that.  And come back and tell me  . . . okay?
  500: Uhh, do that.  And come back and tell me . . . okay?
  258: Who the hell's Ralph?
  259: Nevermind. I'll get more info on the caravan problem.
  260: He's coming for your soul!
  261: |-
    Hey! You're making fun of me, aren't you? Rutger, show this
     jerk the street! And don't come back without some real information!
  262: |-
    Yeah, right. Like I'd believe that. Get out until you
     can find me something useful.
  263: Well, whatta'ya got for me?
  264: It was Mutants.
  265: Well, I know it wasn't the Death Claw who took the caravans.
  266: Leave me alone! You got your reward, now get out!
  267: Hey, put that down!
  268: That's it. Rutger's gonna take it out of your hide!
  269: Stop that right now!
  501: Hey! Knock that off!
  270: Well, what are you doing in here? Get out!
  272: Oh . . . well, it's not so get out!
  273: Rutger's going to turn you into a human pretzel. Have fun. RUTGER!
  274: |-
    Well, you're a bright one, ain't you? Here's the job:
     Find out who's stealing my caravans. Money, big. You fail, hurt, big.
     Understand? Now get outta here!
  275: Wow, you're dumb. I don't have time for this. Go talk to Rutger.
  276: Go talk to Rutger. He can tell you more about that crap.
  277: Like I told you . . .
  502: Like I told you . . .
  278: As I said . . .
  503: As I said . . .
  279: I ain't gonna repeat myself again!
  280: Listen, I ain't gonna say it again!
  281: |-
    He's the owner of the Maltese Falcon over on the west side.
     I'd stay clear of him; he's not honest, like me.
  282: Uh, no. Uh no, we don't talk about that.
  283: |-
    The Maltese Falcon is a nightclub on the west side.
     Hope sings there. What a doll.
  284: |-
    What a pain they are. We think their hideout's in Old Town,
     but we can't prove it.
  285: |-
    Oh, he's the sheriff. But if you see a crime, report to me.
     Justin doesn't rule the roost around here.
  286: |-
    Old Harold? What do you want with that old mutant? He's in Old Town.
     Just ask there.
  287: |-
    Those bastards. Daren Hightower thinks he owns the damn Hub,
     just because of the Water Tower.
  288: He heads the Water Merchants. Nasty, greedy bastard is what he is.
  289: |-
    You can find them over on the northwest edge of Downtown.
     They controlled the hospital before the Children moved in.
     Talk about trading the strange for the weird.
  290: He's the boss of the Crimson Caravan. If you ask me he's nuts.
  291: Don't you know where your own feet are?
  292: That's me. You blind or something?
  293: |-
    Uh, Beth's the manager of the Weapon Store.
     She hears lots of rumors, if you're into that kind of stuff.
  294: Rutger's my assistant.
  295: |-
    It's south of the Merchant Market. The only source of water here
     and for a lot of the surrounding area. The Water Merchants own the damn thing.
  296: |-
    Three of my caravans have disappeared in the past month.
     At first I thought it was either the Water Merchants or the Crimson Caravan,
     but they've had disappearances too.
  297: It's where everybody trades. Smack dab middle of town.
  298: |-
    Uh, no I-I don't  . . . Go talk to Beth, she knows more about
     that crap.
  299: |-
    The Glow is a radioactive pit way, way down south.
     Too much radiation for anyone to live there.
  300: Old Town's over on the east side. The skags hang out there.
  301: It's over on the west side.
  302: |-
    Junktown? Yeah, I've been up north to that place a few times.
     Got some great booze.
  303: |-
    Junktown? It's up north. Heard they're having some trouble,
     what with their mayor Killian getting killed and all.
  304: He's the mayor of Junktown, that's all I know.
  305: I heard he's dead. What more do you need to know?
  306: |-
    Oh, they're a bunch of gun freaks up to the northwest.
     Really weird. They do make a damn fine weapon, though.
  307: He leads the Brotherhood. It's about all I know.
  308: |-
    Well, it's a big ruined city to the south. The Children,
     the Followers and Adytum are there, along with all the gangs and stuff.
  309: |-
    Why? What've you heard? I heard it'd been ransacked,
     but no one knows who did it. But uh, I'm not worried. No one can take the Hub.
  310: |-
    Well, it's the place where everyone goes to trade in the
     Boneyard. It's the only place civilized enough to do it.
  311: Last I heard, he's the mayor of Adytum.
  312: |-
    Well, they run a big, ol' hospital on the southwest side
     of Downtown. Bunch of religious nuts, if you ask me.
  313: He heads up the Children of the Cathedral down in the Boneyard.
  314: |-
    Jain's the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral
     and sets up the hospital here in the Hub.
  504: I've no idea what you're talking about.
  315: I uh . . . heard stories, that's all. No truth to them.
  316: |-
    Best prices on the best guns in town. Everyone says so,
     it's not just that I own it! Just trot out this door and make a right.
     You can't miss it.
  317: |-
    Now there's some good eating. Bob's has got the best charred
     iguana this side of the desert.
  318: |-
    Well, you . . . uh . . . you don't want to go there.
     The prices are really high and the quality's bad.
  319: |-
    What do you want with them wackos? Jeez, all that peace
     preaching and tree hugging. Makes me sick.
  320: Don't know anything 'bout that.
  321: I . . . uh . . . don't think I want to tell you. Yeah, that's it.
  322: Never heard of it. You must have made it up or something.
  323: Well, last I heard it was trashed by someone. Don't know who, though.
  324: I'm busy right now.  Talk to Rutger.  He'll let me know if you're worth seeing.
  325: I've got nothing to say to you.
  326: Where do I get my reward?
  327: What was I supposed to do again?
  328: Get the hell out of here!
  329: Nothing yet.
  330: Snargle!!!
  331: Get out of here, you moron.
  980: Don't know anything 'bout that.
  981: I . . . uh . . . don't think I want to tell you. Yeah, that's it.

    Well, you . . . uh . . . you don't want to go there.

    What do you want with them wackos? Jeez, all that peace

    Those bastards. Daren Hightower thinks he owns the damn Hub,
     just because of the Water Tower.
  1140: He heads the Water Merchants. Nasty, greedy bastard is what he is.
  1141: |-
    Oh, he's the sheriff. But if you see a crime, report to me.
     Justin doesn't rule the roost around here.
  1142: |-
    You can find them over on the northwest edge of Downtown.
     They controlled the hospital before the Children moved in.
     Talk about trading the strange for the weird.
  1143: He's the boss of the Crimson Caravan. If you ask me he's nuts.
  1144: Don't you know where your own feet are?
  1145: |-
    It's south of the Merchant Market. The only source of water
     here and for a lot of the surrounding area. The Water Merchants own the damn thing.
  1146: |-
    Three of my caravans have disappeared in the past month.
     At first I thought it was either the Water Merchants or the Crimson Caravan,
     but they've had disappearances too.
  1147: He's the mayor of Junktown, that's all I know.
  1148: Oh, they're a bunch of gun freaks up to the northwest. Really weird.  They
    do make a damn fine weapon, though.
  1149: |-
    Well, it's a big ruined city to the south. The Children,

MVCOMP:
  100: This computer is labeled Atomic Access Computer.
  101: |-
    There are cables running from the access computer to
     the warhead behind it.
  102: |-
    You have armed the warhead. A timer with four minutes
     has started a countdown.
  103: You have disarmed the nuclear warhead.
  104: BOOOOOOOOOM! [You have set off the nuke!]
  105: That doesn't seem to be working.
  106: The countdown is still going . . . maybe you should cut that red wire.
  107: Maybe you need to use the key also.
  108: |-
    This computer is equipped with a hardware locking device that prevents
     the arming of the bomb without the proper key.
  109: It is impossible the lockpick this heavily secure lock.
  110: This computer cannot be repaired.
  111: You cannot use the traps skill on this computer.
  112: You are not skilled enough to defeat the security mechanism.
SINK:
  100: You see a sink.
  101: You wash your hands.
  102: 'You wash your '
  103: ". It is a bit cleaner."
FOOTPRNT:
  100: |-
    There seems to be a large amount of foot traffic in the area,
     possibly leading to the manhole cover.
RICHIE:
  100: You see Richie.
  101: You're not supposed to do that. I'm gonna have to stop you!
  102: You're not supposed to be here. Do you realize I'm supposed to kill you?
  103: Your shift is over. I'm your replacement.
  104: Hub vault inspector. I'm here to inspect the vault. Move aside.
  105: Kid, fight it. End the cycle of violence now!
  106: Who told you that! Mister, if you attack me, it'll be the biggest mistake of
    your life!
  107: Hi kid! What's in the steel vault?
  108: Too late, punk. You're dead.
  109: Uh… yeah… runk…
  110: I'm not supposed to be talking to you! Scram!
  111: |-
    It's about time! It's hot in here! Boring too! If I didn't need this job to feed my family, I'd tell
     Lorenzo to stick it. See you tomorrow.
  112: I'm not supposed to leave this place and you're not supposed to be here. Get
    out!
  113: |-
    You Hub officials make me sick! Inspecting my bosses' vault! What's next, higher taxes? Can't a man
     earn an honest living anymore without you bureaucrats trying to control everything? One of these days we're
     going to take a stand. Yeah, one of these days the common man is going to give you fatcats a knee to the
     balls like you deserve. One of these days we'll get you real good… I can't wait… By the way, it's not meant
     personal. I know you're just doing your job. I'll get out of your face while you do your inspection. Bye.
  114: Don't give me this crap! Get outta here now or I'll have to shoot you!
  115: Oh yeah. Well no one pushes around Richie Glowsteader and gets away with it!
  116: |-
    Oh just about ten thousand Hub Bucks. Hope you weren't thinking of stealing it. I'd have to kill
     you. I almost killed someone once, so you don't want to mess with me!
  117: |-
    Man, you're stupid. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Now let's try this again. "Yes" means I
     blow your head off. "No" means you get your butt out of here. Which is it going to be?
  118: Ah . . . yes . . .
  119: Uh… no…
  120: Runk! Runk!
  121: Man, I can't do it! It'd be like shooting a dumb animal. Just get outta here,
    okay?
  122: That's good. Now run along now. I'm sure you might find someone to feed you…
  123: |-
    Maybe one runk means "yes" and two runks mean "no". Okay, "runk" means I kill you. "Runk, runk" means
     you leave. Okay?
  124: Runk
  125: Runk, runk.
  126: Runk, runk, runk!
  127: Three runks. Shit, this isn't working. Maybe I'll just ignore you and you'll
    wander off…
SHARK:

  101: You see a man with filed teeth.
  102: You bitch!
  103: |-
    Hey, fresh bait! So, what brings you in to our territory, chum?
     Here for a little fun? At your expense, of course.
  104: Actually, I'm here to kick butt and chew gum . . . you can guess the rest.
  105: What do you do for fun around here?
  106: Uh, I was just leaving. Bye.
  107: Just stopped by for a drink and some . . . entertainment.
  108: Glopf!
  109: We beat up posers like you!
  110: 'Not so fast! Nobody just walks into our place without payin'' the pain tax. '
  111: I think you'll do. Boys, grab her.
  112: Let me introduce you to the tax man. He's called Mr. Sledgehammer!
  113: I don't think so!
  114: |-
    Well, for this evening's entertainment, we've decided to thrash this place!
     Heh. Grab what you can carry and let's see some blood run, eh?
  115: Think I'll just grab a brew.
  116: Smash and grab? Count me in!
  117: Not tonight, I have a headache.
  118: Nah, I'd rather have something to eat . . . perhaps grilled shark!
  119: Ah, you loser. Go run back to your momma.
  120: You again? Geez, some people just don't learn!
  121: Just stopped in for a quick drink.
  122: Just leaving, never mind.
  123: Glorpf!
  124: |-
    Not a bad idea. Think I'll have one myself. Of course,
     you always have to wash a beer down with some bloodshed!
  125: |-
    I thought you'd get the picture by now, to beat it. Guess I
     was wrong. Well, at least it'll be fun to beat you!
  126: We'll be back, old man. This isn't over.
FOLGUARD:
  100: You see Savil of the Follower's Guards.
  101: You see Nancy of the Follower's Guards.

  104: You see Jessica of the Follower's Guards.

  108: You see Henry of the Follower's Guards.
  109: You see Herion of the Follower's Guards.
  110: Who travels the halls of the Followers?
  111: Huh?
  112: 'I am '
  113: ". I come in peace."
  114: 'I am '
  115: ". Your destroyer."
  116: Who are the Followers?
  117: OK. I can see that you are a little slow. Who you?
  118: 'Me '
  119: ". You dead."
  120: 'Me '
  121: ". Me hep."
  122: Me kill!
  123: 'Me '
  124: ". Me go."
  125: |-
    You want to help? I think you will need to talk to Nicole or Jake
     if you want to help us. They have more time for dealing with slower people.
  126: OK. Just stay out of trouble around here.
  127: Do you see to end the evil of the Children?
  128: Yes. I want to wipe out those scum.
  129: No. I'd rather kill you wimps.
  130: Who are these Children?
  131: Why would I want to kill children?
  132: |-
    Excellent! Go talk to Nicole and she will be able to tell you how
     you can help us.
  133: |-
    The Children are an occult group who worship some dark god. Personally,
     I think there is something about them that reeks of evil.
  134: I will kill them.
  135: I don't know. They sound too strong for me.
  136: What can I do to help?
  137: Forget it! There is no way I will help you.
  138: |-
    They are a strong lot, but I think with someone of your skills,
     you will be able to get in and help us destroy them.
  139: I'll do it then.
  140: No. I don't think I will help.
  141: |-
    Suit yourself. If they take over the wastelands, don't say we didn't
     warn you.
  142: "If you talk to Nicole, she will be able to tell you more of what can\n be
    done to stop them. "
  143: Thank you. Goodbye.
  144: |-
    Not children. We wouldn't think of harming them. No. These are the
     Children of the Cathedral. A nasty group of people.
  145: In that case, sure - I'll waste them.
  146: |-
    Oh. I thought you were talking about kids. Nevermind. I don't think
     I'll help.
  147: What can you tell me about these Children?
  148: |-
    We are the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are trying to bring peace
     to the wastelands.
  149: Sounds like a good idea. Good luck with it.
  150: How do you plan on doing that?
  151: That seems highly unlikely.
  152: |-
    We are working to bring about tolerance to those in the wastelands
     for those few unfortunates who have been mutated by man's destructive nature.
  153: Good luck with that, then.
  154: |-
    In all of history, we have never been able to get tolerance.
     Why do you think the War happened?
  155: That's just a bunch of bull.
  156: |-
    You are right in saying that we, as humans, have been close-minded.
     However, there is always hope.
  157: Good luck to you, then.
  158: I think you are right. Here, let me make you more open-minded with this.
  159: Be that as it may, your opinion was not requested. Goodbye.
  160: |-
    A cynic in our midsts. I am sure you have your reasons. Regardless,
     I am certain we can bring about some type of understanding.
  161: Good luck to you then. Goodbye.
  162: |-
    I've heard that the Children have been able to get some of our secrets.
     I wonder how that is happening?
  163: I believe that there is a spy somewhere around here.
  164: I know. I am selling your secrets to them.
  165: I am sure you are just imagining things. How can they know anything?
  166: |-
    Truly? I thought as much myself, but feared that I would never have
     been able to get much support on the theory.
  167: Do you have any clues as to who it could be?
  168: I'm glad to know that. Thanks for your time.
  169: You are the double agent!!!
  170: |-
    Not really. The only thing I can think of is that the person would
     have to have access to some information and have access to the outside.
     You might want to look to the initiates or scouts.
  171: Thanks. Goodbye.
  172: Nicole will be pleased, then, to know that I killed the agent.
  173: You must be right. Thank you for setting me straight.
  174: |-
    I think you are the double agent. Trying to trick me, I see. Well
     now you DIE!
  175: |-
    Great job on wasting that agent. Now we might have a chance against
     those Children.
  176: Good luck to you.
  177: I can help train you to become more efficient in your fighting.
  178: Would you? That would be wonderful.
  179: There you go. Maybe that will help you on your fighting.
GUSTOFER:
  100: Sorry, no boxing today.
  101: Hnn.
  102: Uk, okay.
  103: When's the next match?
  104: |-
    You might try signing up with Gizmo. I hear he's always looking for
     new meat to toss in the ring.
  105: Try again tomorrow. Saul will be boxing then.
  106: |-
    You just missed it. Try again in a couple of days. Saul boxes every three
     days.
  107: Thanks.
  108: Who's Saul?
  109: Saul is the local champion. Saul is the current favorite of Gizmo.
  110: Hey, there. No boxing today.
  111: " Try again tomorrow."
  112: " Try again the day after tomorrow."
  113: So! Want to lay a bet on the fight?
  114: I've got better things to do with my money. Goodbye.
  115: What are the odds?
  116: No, thanks. Mind if I ask a few questions, though?
  117: "[]"
  118: Sorry, but today's match is already over.
  119: Oh. Well, never mind, then.
  120: |-
    Who do you want to bet on, Saul or the challenger? Odds favor Saul winning.
     Cost is 25 caps to bet; you get 50 if you win betting on Saul, 100 if you win
     betting on the challenger!
  121: I'll bet on Saul.
  122: I'll bet on the challenger.
  123: All right, I guess.
  124: Who's the boxer?
  125: Who runs these matches?
  126: Uh, never mind.
  127: Sorry, I don't have the time. Maybe later.
  128: |-
    Saul, the fastest fist in Junktown! He's a marvel of manly musculature!
     A pulsating power puncher!
  129: He's a nice guy, too.
  130: Um, yeah. So, who runs these matches?
  131: Thanks. See you around.
  132: |-
    Gizmo, the casino owner, employs Saul. He occasionally likes to watch a
     match or two, but mostly it's good money - people will bet a lot on a fight.
     And nobody has to get killed, unlike those death matches they supposedly have
     in the Hub.
  133: Death matches?
  134: Thanks.
  135: |-
    Well, it's just a rumor. But they say there's an underground fighting ring
     there where you can pay to watch people fight to the death. Not my kind of
     fight.
  136: Hmm. Thanks.
  137: Hey, what are you doing?
  138: Uh, nothing.
  139: You wanna start something, loser?
  140: Please quit it.
  141: Uh, no. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
  142: Well, well, looks like you're a winner! Here's your caps.
  143: Come back when you have enough caps to bet!
  144: Would you like to wait here until the fight starts at 2:00?
  145: Sure, what the heck.
  146: Nah, I got stuff to do. I'll be back later.
  147: Okay, but if you miss, the fight, you forfeit your bet!
  148: Let the fight begin!
  149: Please don't disturb me while the match is in progress.
  150: Well, you can't win them all, my friend. Better luck next time.
  151: Well, you can't win them all, my friend. Better luck next time.
  152: Sorry, one bet per fight.
HUBSMITY:
  100: You see Smitty.
  101: You wanna talk after what you've pulled? Screw you!

  104: Hi yourself. Go blow smoke somewhere else.
VALTLOCK:

VANCE:

  101: What can I do for you?
  102: I buY stufF.
  103: Who are you?
  104: What goes on in this building?
  105: I've heard you've got what I need.  Can I score some?
  106: Nevermind. Bye.
  107: The name's Vance, and that's all you need to know. Can I get you anything?
  108: How should I know, if you don't tell me what you're selling?
  109: Good to meet you Vance. What do you have to sell?
  110: Empty
  111: Nevermind. Bye.
  112: If you don't already know, you shouldn't be here. Now leave.
  113: I GO WHEREVER I DAMN WELL PLEASE! GO TO HELL!
  114: OK.  I'll leave.
  115: Nevermind is right!  Now get out of here!
  116: Make me... if you can, freak!
  117: OK OK... I'm leavin'.
  118: You seem OK.  Here's what I've got.
  119: "<Barter>"
  120: What can I do for you?
  121: want morE.
  122: I would like to buy some more stuff.
  123: I don't like your kind.
  124: Who are your friends over there?
  125: Who are your firends in the back room?
  126: Just hangin' out.
  127: Sorry to hear that.  Now leave.
  128: NO!
  129: I'm leaving.
  130: That's Justin and Chad.  They're here to make sure nobody causes any trouble.
  131: They look like a couple of pansies.
  132: Nice to meet you guys.
  133: I'm just going to hang out for a while, if it's all right with you guys.
  134: Just some friends of mine.  That's all you need to know.  Don't ask too many
    questions.
  135: Very well. What do you have to sell?
  136: I know what you're doing here and I don't like it.
  137: I'm just going to hang out for a while, if it's all right with you guys.
  138: Let's get down to business.
  139: OK, whadda' you got?
  140: I think I'll just hang out for a while.
  141: You're not welcome here.  Now get outta' here!
  142: I'm going to send you to Hell where your kind belongs.
  143: Sorry. Excuse me.
  144: Hey, calm down.  We just had a misunderstanding.  Let's talk.
  145: I don't want any trouble, so I think it would be best if you leave before I
    do something you'll regret.
  146: noooooooo!
  147: OhhKaay. I go.
  148: I don't care what you think.
  149: Nevermind. Bye.
  150: Don't use it all in one place.
  151: Thanks.
  152: Ug.
VINNIE:
  100: You see Vinnie from the Skulz gang.
  101: You see a young man with a tattoo and a bad attitude.
  102: I'd like to join you guys.
  103: You're on Skulz turf, stranger. You'd better talk quick.
  104: Sorry, wrong room.
  105: Skulz? Who are you guys?
  106: Urgh?
  107: Yeah, you bet this is the wrong room!
  108: |-
    We are the one and only Junktown gang. We have the run of the streets,
     and we rule the city at night.
  109: Oh. Sorry. Bye.
  110: You couldn't run the schoolyard, Chromo.
  111: I thought this city was run by Gizmo after hours.
  112: Get out of here, you moron!
  113: |-
    That slob can't even stand up by himself. We're the muscle in this town.
     We take what we want.
  114: I see.
  115: You have some sort of deal with Killian?
  116: What?! You'll pay for that remark!
  117: |-
    We don't bother Killian and he doesn't bother us as long as we keep it
     low-key. You get me?
  118: Yeah. Bye.
  119: I get it, all right. You have to hide out from him.
  120: |-
    We don't take that from anybody, least of all Killian! Just because
     he thinks he's a glorified sheriff doesn't mean that he controls the Skulz!
  121: Sorry, didn't mean to get you all riled up.
  122: |-
    So, he cramps your style, eh? Mine, too. In fact, I'm thinking of
     whacking him. You want in?
  123: |-
    You want to whack Killian? Man, you're crazy. Man, I don't know . . .
     all right, I'm in.
  124: You loser, you said we were going to whack Killian. Get out of here.
  125: C'mon, let's dust Killian.
  126: What do you want now?
  127: Nothing. Sorry.
  128: |-
    I'm looking for someone to help me take out Killian. The Skulz seemed like
     a good prospect.
  129: Damn, I didn't think you'd do it! The Skulz rule this town now! Woo!
  130: |-
    We've been down this road before. You didn't have the balls then, so get
     the hell out of here!
  131: |-
    You want to join us, huh? How do we know you're tough enough to be a
     Skul?
  132: I'll show you tough enough, you son of a bitch!
  133: Let me prove myself to you.
  134: Trust me, I'm tough enough.
  135: "[Vinnie looks at you and laughs.] I don't think so."
  136: I'll prove it to you.
  137: That's it. Time for you to die.
  138: You're right, I'll be leaving now.
  139: What makes the Skulz so tough?
  140: |-
    [Vinnie thinks for a second.] If you want to prove you belong in the Skulz,
     I want you to steal that old bastard's wife's ashes. Heh. [Vinnie mumbles]
     Let's make Neal suffer for his last couple of hours . . .
  141: All right, I'll do it.
  142: No way.
  143: Uh, I don't think I could do that.
  144: I already stole it.
  145: That won't be as tough as you might think. I already killed the bastard.
  146: |-
    If you're hard enough to do that, mebbe you'd make a Skul after all.
     Bring it here once you've got it.
  147: I knew you weren't Skulz material. Get the hell out of here.
  148: You got it?
  149: Yep.
  150: No.
  151: I had to kill Neal to get it. He cried like a little girl.
  152: Ha ha! Let that old cock suffer until we off him tonight - are you in?
  153: I decided I'd rather not have anything to do with scabs like you.
  154: Let's crush him.
  155: I've got some other shit to do before then - I'll meet you there.
  156: What are you wasting my time for?
  157: |-
    That'll show that old fuck. Thanks for taking care of him for us.
     [Vinnie gets a tear in his eye.] You're a Skul, now.
  158: Uh, all right . . . meet us later, but don't take too long.
  159: Soon, Neal gets his, huh?
  160: We said we'd be back, you old fuck!
  161: There's a large collection of people arriving at the bar . . .
  162: Fuck you, cop!
  163: |-
    You gain 400 experience points for stealing Neal's urn. The dead shall
     never rest in peace.
  164: You gain 300 experience points for puttin' a cap in Neal's ass, you Skul.
  165: You ready to take out Neal?
  166: Yeah, let's ice the bastard.
  167: Nah, I got some more stuff to do.
  168: No way. I want out.
  169: It's too late for that, slick. When you're out, you're way out.
  170: We rule this town.
  171: Hey, bro, we rule this town!
GENFGT:
  100: You see a Far Go Trader Merchant.
  101: Get the hell out.
  102: Take off or you won't live to regret it.
  103: Skag!
  104: Do you want some of this, punk?
  105: Ready for some more punishment?
  106: Don't make me hurt you again!
  107: Do you have a death wish or something? Get lost.
RAIDPRIS:
  100: You see a dejected prisoner of the Raiders.
  101: Hey, you! Get me out of here!
  102: Be quiet, you're gonna alert the guards!
  103: Shh! Who are you?
  104: Goop
  105: I don't care. Get me out of here please!
  106: My name is Jack. I'm from Junktown. These monsters killed the rest of my caravan
    and put me here.
  107: Ok. I'll see what I can do.
  108: What a bummer. Enjoy your stay.
  109: Please, just help me out.
  110: Ow! My leg. It's hurt. I think it might be broken. Please help me!
JUNKJAIL:
  100: |-
    You have broken out of the jail. You're now definitely a fugitive in
     Junktown!
  101: |-
    The door looks solid, and has a stout lock. Still, locks can be picked, and
     doors can be destroyed.
  102: The door is locked.
  103: You unlock the door.
  104: You lock the door.
  105: You fail to unlock the door.
  106: You fail to lock the door.
  107: You gain 250 experience points for busting out of jail!
RADIO:
  100: radio
  101: |-
    [There is a squeal of static, then you hear a deep voice over the
     radio.] Command to patrol, command to patrol. What is your status?
     Over.
  102: Eek!
  103: Uh, nothing is wrong here. We're fine, uh, how are you?
  104: |-
    Command, we are under attack by a large group of armed
     humans. Request assistance. Over.
  105: 'Help! Unknown attackers! Heavy damage! Coordinates follow: 10 . . . Argh!'
  106: Understood, patrol. We are sending assistance now. Over.
  107: Who is this? What is your purpose?
  108: My purpose is to shut the hell up.
  109: I'm, uh, oh, never mind. I'm just going to kill you all anyways.
  110: |-
    This is, hmm, Fred. My purpose is patrol. I guess I'm a, uh,
     little dazed after that fall.
  111: Understood, patrol. What are your coordinates?
  112: 224 by 104.
  113: Four miles, south-southwest.
  114: Gamma sector, at Omicron-Delta-Beta.
  115: Understood, patrol. Command, out.
  116: Understood, patrol. We are sending reinforcements.
  117: Ah, that explains it. We are sending help now.
  118: Roger, patrol. We're sending help now! Hold on!
  119: There is only static on the radio.
  120: |-
    You hear some chatter on the radio. You listen for a
     while, and discover nothing of importance.
  121: |-
    The radio has a red blinking light. You hear a high
     pitched squealing over the radio speaker.
  122: It sounds like encrypted audio.
  123: |-
    You send the command code to toggle the force field
     settings.
  124: There is only quiet static on the radio channel.
  125: The radio is not functioning.
  126: |-
    This radio is in perfect condition. The source
     of the problem must be external.
  127: |-
    There is nothing but the squeal of encrypted data
     over the radio.
  128: "[Squeal-snick-pop] Command here, go ahead patrol."
  129: Ack!
  130: Uh, sorry, Command. I hit the talk button by mistake.
  131: Intruders in the base! Sound the alert!
  132: Roger Patrol, Command out.
  133: |-
    [You dial the frequency of the radio to the security control
     channel] [Click!] Enter access number. [Click!]
  134: Hng!
  135: Uh, 69.
  136: '5566534571'
  137: End access.
  138: Automatic security channel shutdown.
  139: You gain 1,500 experience points for tricking the mutant guards.
  140: |-
    You gain 2,000 experience points for sneaking into the depths of the
     military base without getting caught (yet) . . .
ELDER:
  100: You see the Elder.
  101: |-
    I am pleased to meet you. I hope you have found this
     little village pleasing so far.
  102: Yes.
  103: Nope, not enough action around here.
  104: |-
    Excellent. I have a favor to ask of you. I promise that
     you will be well-rewarded for your services to this
     community.
  105: Tell me more . . .
  106: |-
    This is just a demo, but perhaps you will like what I
     have to say next.
  107: I'm all ears . . .
  108: |-
    We have been plagued by Rad Scorpions for some time
     now. All who have been sent to destroy these
     monsters have not returned. I will give you weapons
     and armor if you will follow my guide to their lair
     and kill them all.
  109: Sounds good.
  110: No thanks.
  111: That is a shame. Please leave.
  112: "Excellent. Sammy here will guide you to the lair.\n Take these items - they
    will come in useful. "
  113: Please help us as soon as possible. Time is wasting.
  114: I don't talk to your kind, stranger.
JTPEASNT:
  100: You see a Junktown peasant.
  101: Get out of here!
  102: I've heard bad things about you. Are they true?
  103: Hi.
  104: This is our place. Wanna hang out for a while?
  105: Hmmm, you look juicy . . .
KENNY:
  100: You see Deputy Kenny.
  101: |-
    If you have business with the Hub police, please talk to Sheriff Greene.  I only take care of his duties when the
     Sheriff is unavailable.
  102: I can't believe the Sheriff is really dead.
  103: |-
    There you are.  I've been waiting for you to return.  We heard the Sheriff was killed during the battle.
      It's hard to believe he's really gone.  He was like a father to me.
  104: |-
    The Sheriff gave me instructions to carry out in the event that he did not return from the mission.  He
     asked me to give you the remainder of your reward.  I believe it was 1000 caps.  [The Deputy hands you 1000 caps]
  105: This city owes you a debt of thanks.  I only wish the Sheriff could be here
    to thank you himself.  Goodbye.
  106: Oh my God!  They killed Kenny!  Those bastards!
LASHER:
  100: You see Lasher of the Children.
  101: I know who you are. You are a wicked, evil man and you must be punished.
  102: I know who you are. You are the devil in woman’s form, but your shape will
    not save you.
  103: |-
    I know who you are. Your wickedness precedes you. You send the souls of children to Hades, before
     they can be cleansed of their perfidy. It is a black evil that you do, and you must be punished for it.
  104: |-
    I know who you are. You are walking death, a plague in human form. Where you step, blood flows
     like a river. But such iniquities can be ended by a righteous soul!
  105: How dare you disturb me! Don’t you know how important my position is? Get out!
  106: |-
    You are unwise to draw your weapon on me. The Master’s shield is upon me, and I may not be touched
     without retribution!
  107: I wouldn’t mind the Master’s shield myself.
  108: Nobody’s ever accused me of being wise!
  109: I just want to speak with the man in charge.
  110: Nice rod you’ve got there! Is that why they call you "Lasher?"
  111: Is it true that you enjoy abusing children?
  112: You wanna see unwise? It’s unwise to give me lip, bitch!
  113: Why you talk so funny?
  114: Why have you come, initiate? You know that I do not like to be disturbed.
  115: Forgive me, Father, but I am troubled.
  116: I seek the guidance of the Cathedral.
  117: I’m here to talk about your treatment of the Children.
  118: I just wanted to talk.
  119: Nice rod you've got there! Is that why they call you Lasher?
  120: How would you like to never be disturbed again. I can arrange that!
  121: I dunno. Why I come? You know?
  122: How dare you enter my sanctuary with a weapon in your hand! Oaf! Get out!
  123: Who do you think you are, entering my sanctum with a drawn weapon. Get out!
  124: |-
    Forgive me, sir. But the forces of darkness are everywhere, and one never knows when you must
     defend yourself.
  125: I seek the guidance of the Cathedral.
  126: I’m here to talk about your treatment of the Children.
  127: I just wanted to talk.
  128: Nice rod you’ve got there! Is that why they call you Lasher?
  129: You don't like drawn weapons. You’re gonna hate what I do with it next!
  130: Out? Which way out?
  131: My quarters are not open to those who have not been consecrated. I must ask
    you to leave at once.
  132: Forgive my intrusion, but I have important questions.
  133: I’m here to talk about your treatment of the Children.
  134: I wanted to ask you about consecration.
  135: Nice rod you’ve got there! Is that why they call you Lasher?
  136: This place don’t look consecrated. I ain’t killed anyone here yet.
  137: You stupid! I got plenty of conse…cra…tion…
  138: That is a privilege reserved for only the most faithful servants. Only baptism
    is a higher honor.
  139: And how does one earn baptism?
  140: I suppose you are teaching the children and preparing them for baptism.
  141: Can you help me to be baptized?
  142: Wow! You must be special!
  143: Too bad privileges ain’t worth a rad scorpion’s ass when you’re dead.
  144: I see no reason to converse with a fool. Away with you.
  145: |-
    You should speak to Father Morpheus. He is in the tower, but it is unlikely that the Nightkin will
     allow you to pass.
  146: Could you persuade the Nightkin to let me pass?
  147: What can you tell me about Morpheus?
  148: What can you tell me about the Nightkin.
  149: Thank you, sir.
  150: I have ways of getting around these sorts of problems.
  151: |-
    The rod is a holy instrument, through which I instruct my charges. Pain clears the mind of evil
     thoughts and allows them to better comprehend the glory of the Master.
  152: I see. So the Master’s a pain?
  153: That’s a horrible thing to do to children!
  154: Sounds kinky. How about trying some on me?
  155: |-
    I instruct the children. It is my duty. All children are wicked beasts. It is my duty to force them
     into evolve into human beings. Perhaps you have heard that I do not tolerate frivolity. This is true. I
     want my charges to suffer as much as possible.
  156: And are mutants more evolved than human beings?
  157: You heartless bastard!
  158: You never got laid, did you?
  159: Tell me more about your teaching methods.
  160: But what about the pleasure of killing? Ain’t that allowed?
  161: You filthy brainless abomination! How dare you defile my presence! Get out!
    Out! Now!
  162: |-
    You are a woman, and therefore you are always troubled. It is an endemic condition of your breed.
     Tell me your problem, madam, and I will resolve it for you.
  163: |-
    If your heart was not so full of wickedness, sir, you would be at ease. A righteous heart knows no
     cares. Tell me your problem, but be quick!
  164: Tell me how to attain righteousness!
  165: I want to know more about the Cathedral.
  166: I want to know about the Master.
  167: You’re alive. That’s my problem, you son of a bitch!
  168: |-
    Learn to embrace pain as your closest friend, for pain is
     the most instructive force in the universe. Break yourself until you can
     exist no longer as an individual, then remake yourself into the Master’s tool.
     That is the solution to all of your problems.
  169: So where can I find the most pain?
  170: |-
    Yeah, I want to get enough brain damage that I’ll join a zombie cult!
     Dream on, pal!
  171: I would never have thought of that!
  172: It is? That sucks, pal!
  173: I already embrace pain. I just like to share it with my friends.
  174: |-
    Beasts chatter without meaning. Human beings think first, and then they talk. You must evolve into
     a human being before I will wish to speak you. Be gone.
  175: Your words are true. Very well, I will help you. But be quick.
  176: I must see Father Morpheus on an urgent matter.
  177: Tell me about the Cathedral.
  178: I was wondering where I could find the Master.
  179: I was wondering about the Children.
  180: The only thing I know that’s quick is Death.
  181: |-
    There comes a time when you must find the answers to life’s questions yourself, and that time is
     now. Begone!
  182: That is not my duty. Now begone.
  183: "By the endurance of pain, by the acquisition of wisdom, and the performance
    of service. Pain is\n knowledge, Wisdom is obedience, and Service is courage. "
  184: "[More]"
  185: |-
    You must reject the Light that nearly destroyed us all, and pledge yourself to the Darkness in which
     all are equal. Now that I have told you this thing, go seek it. Seek the Master and his wisdom.
  186: |-
    I have not consulted him, but I am certain he is pleased with the righteous souls I have brought
     him. It is difficult work, but I do it well. Unfortunately, it is also quite time consuming, which is why
     I must order to you to leave right now.
  187: A flatterer’s tongue is in the mouth of a devil! A devil such as you! Get out
    of my sight!
  188: You foul mouthed beast! Begone! Learn some manners before you return.
  189: A reasonable request. Take this symbol. Show it to the Nightkin when you wish
    to pass.
  190: I cannot help you with that. Begone.
  191: He is our leader. He is close to the Master’s counsels and knows many of his
    purposes. Is that all?
  192: Could you persuade the Nightkin to let me pass?
  193: Tell me more about Morpheus?
  194: What can you tell me about the Nightkin?
  195: Thank you, sir.
  196: So why do you follow this Morpheus bozo?
  197: |-
    They serve the Master. They bring the pain of healing to the world. Angels in the Night, who redeem
     the world by bloodshed. Curiosity is a foolhardy emotion, but doubly so when it comes to the Nightkin. That
     is your only warning. I have much to do now. Away with you.
  198: |-
    Your courtesy does you credit. Perhaps you are worthy to talk with Morpheus. If the Nightkin stops
     you, show them this symbol. Now, away with you!
  199: You are a fool if you think petty subterfuge will defeat the Nightkin. Get
    out of here!
  200: |-
    Decadence and ease prevents evolution, evolution that is necessary for survival in a harsh world.
     Fortunately, I am a hard man who cares nothing for seductive pleasures. I see that you disagree with me.
     I do not care about your opinion. Get out of here!
  201: |-
    Mutation is nothing to fear. Every birth is a mutation of our parents’ DNA. We are all mutants. The
     only thing that matters is that the mutant is guided on a moral and productive path. This is my job. And
     this also ends this discussion. Leave me now.
  202: |-
    I deal out pain. If the animal is worthy and can learn from it, it evolves into a righteous soul. If
     it does not, it does not deserve to exist. On rare occasions, the animal is removed the genetic pool,
     although not as often as I would like. This happens more often with failed grown animals.
  203: And the Master approves of the teaching methods?
  204: You’re a monster!
  205: I think I’ll leave you now.
  206: Do you teach adults?
  207: Grown animals?
  208: Hey, I can remove them for you! No one else needs to know!
  209: |-
    You are an evil girl. You would do well to tread carefully here. The Nightkin do not enjoy rivals.
     Now begone!
  210: |-
    You are an evil man. You would do well to tread carefully here. The Nightkin do not enjoy rivals.
     Now begone!
  211: |-
    Righteousness is attained through struggle, trauma, and recovery. We are animals who must be
     continuously be broken until we accept the Master’s truth without hesitation. Now that you have heard
     the truth, seek it with the body of your experiences. Get out of here.
  212: Your tongue is a wicked thing that is beyond redemption. Get out of my sight!
  213: |-
    The Cathedral teaches many things which an undisciplined mind is incapable of comprehending.
     Now I have other duties to perform. Away with you!
  214: |-
    As do I. It appears we have many things in common, but unfortunately, you irritate me beyond my
     ability to tolerate. Get out of here. Now.
  215: It is not my place to judge. You must persuade the Nightkin. Good luck. You
    will need it.
  216: |-
    The Cathedral is a sanctuary for the human race. When the apocalypse fell on this foul city, the
     Cathedral was spared, which allowed for the birth of the Master. Thus a healing darkness emerged from
     a terrible light.
  217: |2-
     When I came, I saw this place lacked a moral center, and so I have endeavored to administer teaching
     pain to a place once consumed with idle pleasure. That is all you need to know.
  218: |-
    It is said the Master waits below, in the Darkness, for the Light above betrayed Mankind and nearly
     destroyed us. But many bless the Light, for they say it birthed the Master.
  219: |2-
     I do not know these things with certainty, and I have never had the privilege to see him. Now if
     you will excuse me, I have work to do.
  220: You were not particularly welcome here in the first place. Good riddance to
    you.
  221: |-
    Once I did, but many of methods were abandoned in favor of the loud noises you hear in the
     Auditorium amphitheater. It is a source of bitterness for me. Fortunately, I can still instruct the
     children. Now if you will excuse me, I have to prepare for their lessons.
  222: |-
    Uh… it is of course, a rare event, and the animal is given every chance to evolve. Now leave here!
     Leave here at once!
  223: "[DONE]"
  224: |-
    This may be of some use to you. Take this symbol. Show it to the Nightkin when you wish to pass. It
     will allow you to see Father Morpheus.
GENSARG:
  100: Stop!
  101: Die, human!
  102: To the death.
  103: You will pay for your sins!
  104: I will crush you!
  105: Unity forever!
  106: For the Master!
  107: |-
    You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little brother. Explain
     yourself.
  108: |-
    You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little sister. Explain
     yourself.
  109: Hngg.
  110: It's okay, I work here.
  111: It's okay, I have a pass.
  112: I am armed by permission of the Lieutenant.
  113: What manner of treason is this?!
  114: Show me your pass, then.
  115: I, uh, left it in my other robe.
  116: It's right here, stapled to the front of my gun.
  117: Hurry on your task then, but be warned -- I'm watching you.
  118: Yes, little brother. What is it that you need from me?
  119: Yes, little sister. What is it that you need from me?
  120: Hng!
  121: Hmm, where's this Master guy?
  122: Praise to the Unity, brother.
  123: I am not one to guide you on the path to Unity. Leave!
  124: You are obviously a heathen! Pay for your sins!
  125: Here is here. Why do you ask?
  126: Oh, uh, no reason.
  127: I am going to kick his ass from here to, uh, someplace really far away!
  128: What question? I said 'Hail to the Master, goodbye.'
  129: You insult me! Die!
  130: Praise to the Unity.
  131: |-
    You sound like you do not believe what you say. Could this be true?
     Or have you left the path of righteous?
  132: |-
    You mistake the tremor in my voice for fear when it is actually
     a cold of some sort.
  133: |-
    I think your kind is doomed, actually. Here, let me prove it with
     some help from my friends . . .
  134: |-
    When you become one of us, you will not fear such minor things.
     Begone.
  135: What do you want this time? I have little time for your talk.
  136: Labbo!
  137: I have little time for your life . . . Die!
  138: Nothing, sorry.
  139: Praise to the Unity, brother.
  140: You are obviously an intruder!
  141: Get out of my face.
  142: I don't have time for you. Stop bothering me.
  200: You see a Super Mutant Sargeant.
  201: Hey, this looks like a nuclear bomb. Why is it here?
  202: |-
    This is our Master's weapon of last resort. If we find
     an enemy we cannot defeat in battle, then we will destroy them
     with this. But I doubt this will ever happen. Even our Master
     does not want to unleash the dreaded power of the atom again!
  203: Ok, thanks.
  204: Is it functional?
  205: |-
    You're welcome. Now be quiet, I need to concentrate on
     guarding this device.
  206: |-
    Oh, yes, it is. We keep it in perfect working condition,
     ready to be detonated at a moment's notice. The Unity will not
     be defeated!
  207: Ah, thanks.
  208: |-
    Aren't you worried that someone could steal some robes
     and sneak in here to set it off?
  209: |-
    No. We are here to guard it from intruders. No one could
     access the device without us noticing. Besides, the nuclear arming
     key required to arm the device is not here.
  210: Oh, that makes sense. Thanks.
  211: |-
    Well, for my sense of safety, could you tell me where the
     key is located?
  212: |-
    Oh, sure, no problem. The Lieutenant keeps the key. He's
     at the Military Base, so he isn't even around here. That keeps
     the nuclear bomb from being set off under our beloved Master.
  213: Thanks for your time.
  214: |-
    [The large mutant peers at you for a moment, with bushy
     eyebrows raised] I think you are asking too many questions.
MUTANT5:
  100: It's some kind of huge super mutant creature! And it has a very large gun!
NEIL:
  100: You see Neil, the head of the guard for the Followers.
  101: You see Neil, the head of the guard for the Followers.
  102: |-
    If you seek someone to talk to, talk to Peter. I'm
     trying to get some sleep.
  103: Why are you here?
  104: Hrr. Arrooo?
  105: Nuh nuh.
  106: KILL!!
  107: 'I''m '
  108: ". I was sent to look for you."
  109: 'I''m '
  110: ". And you are dead."
  111: What can you tell me about the Followers?
  112: I have come to offer my assistance.
  113: I seek ways in which to instill peace upon this desolate wasteland.
  114: I am sorry, but I can't understand you. Now, what are you doing here?
  115: Nuh nuh.
  116: Me Kill!!
  117: Hep. Me hep.
  118: If you are doing nothing, then I suggest that you leave. Now!
  119: You wish to help? Maybe I can use you.
  120: Yes. Me hep! Me hep!
  121: No. No hep!
  122: |-
    You are simple enough to find this person that others are
     too smart to find. There is a spy around here who is giving
     our secrets to the Children. Find the spy. Kill the spy. Go.
  123: I thought as much. Be off with you.
  124: |-
    Figures that Jake doesn't think that I can get the job
     done right. He's the only one who could have sent you.
     Then you know about the spy.
  125: Jake didn't send me. One of your guards did.
  126: I know some. Jake was very short with words.
  127: What is this about a spy? Maybe I can help.
  128: |-
    My guards are no fools. They sent you to the right person.
     There is a leak in here, and we need to find out where it is and seal it.
  129: Have any leads?
  130: I'm a fighter, not a plumber. If you have leaks, talk to someone else.
  131: I think you are the leak. Die!!
  132: Forget it. I'm nobody's lackey.
  133: |-
    The only thing that we know so far is that the person has
     to have access to the Children's Cathedral. I think it may be one of our scouts.
  134: Okay. I will check it out right now.
  135: Are you sure it is not a guard?
  136: Tough luck then. You'll never catch the person now.
  137: |-
    I am quite certain. They only have access to the halls
     of the Followers. They are not allowed outside.
  138: Then I don't know who it could be.
  139: I'll look into the scouts then.
  140: I think there is a cover-up here. You die!
  141: |-
    That is why I am asking you to look around and see
     if you can find someone. Will you help?
  142: Yes.
  143: No.
  144: Thank you. This means a lot to us.
  145: Then I must detain you from warning anyone.
  146: |-
    How he ever became second in command is beyond me. Since he
     was so scarce in words, I will fill you in. We have a leak who
     is feeding the Children some of our movement patterns.
  147: Have any leads?
  148: I'm a fighter, not a plumber. If you have leaks, talk to someone else.
  149: I think you are the leak. Die!!
  150: Forget it. I'm nobody's lackey.
  151: |-
    You don't even know? I guess you wouldn't; most people
     in here don't. Someone is sneaking information of our
     movements to the Children. We need that person gone.
  152: Have any leads?
  153: I think you are the leak. Die!!
  154: Forget it. I'm nobody's lackey.
  155: How much are you willing to offer?
  156: I don't have much money. How about 200 caps?
  157: Sorry, I'm broke.
  158: Your life.
  159: Sounds fair to me.
  160: Now I will end this leak in the Followers!
  161: Tough luck then.
  162: What would you like to know?
  163: Who is the leader?
  164: Why are you attacking the Children?
  165: Where can I get some first aid?
  166: Nothing. Just checking.
  167: Nothing. Thank you.
  168: |-
    Our leader is Nicole. Really nice person, but a bit flighty.
     Anything else you want to know?
  169: Why are you attacking the Children?
  170: Where can I get some healing?
  171: Nothing. Just checking. *smack*
  172: Nothing. Thank you.
  173: |-
    The Children are not what they appear to be. They
     are hiding something. Something related to those Nightkin. Anything else?
  174: Who is the leader?
  175: Where can I get some healing?
  176: Nothing. Just checking. *smack*
  177: Nothing. Thank you.
  178: |-
    There is the Children's healer, but I don't trust them. We
     also have a doctor or nurse on duty here at all times. Anything else?
  179: Who is the leader?
  180: Why are you attacking the Children?
  181: Nothing. Just checking. *smack*
  182: Nothing. Thank you.
  183: I am truly sorry to hear that. Pieces be with you!
  184: Who sent you?
  185: Your guard sent me.
  186: Jake sent me.
  187: I sent me.
  188: Never mind. Good bye.
  189: |-
    A bit sure of yourself. I have no need for you.
     Talk to Nicole if you wish to offer your services.  Good night.
  190: |-
    Then you will want to search out Nicole. She can help
     you better with that. Good evening.
  191: Go find that spy. We need to keep our plans secret still longer.
  192: |-
    Good job on finding and removing Heather. Her meddling
     nearly got everyone killed. I wish there was something more we could do.
  193: Perhaps I can help you once more.
  194: Good luck to you.
  195: How so?
  196: |-
    I can train the Followers in some skills for war. Maybe
     your chances will improve.
  197: I can leave. Good bye.
  198: That would be wonderful. Thank you.
  199: Now you are a bit more prepared. Good evening.
  200: |-
    Thank you for your teachings. Now we have a chance to
     beat back those Children.
HTWRBOX:
  100: You see a locked strongbox.
  101: You see an unlocked stronbox.
  102: The strongbox is locked.
  103: While opening the strongbox, you detected and disarmed a trap.
  104: While opening the strongbox, you detected a trap, but accidentally set it off.
  105: While opening the strongbox, you detected a trap, but failed to disarm it.
  106: The strongbox is already unlocked.
  107: You successfully unlocked the strongbox.
  108: Your multiple attempts to unlock the strongbox have set off a trap.
  109: You were unable to unlock the strongbox, and the lock has become jammed.
  110: You were unable to unlock the strongbox.
  111: You find a trap on the strongbox and successfully disarm it.
  112: You find a trap on the strongbox.
  113: While searching the strongbox for traps, you accidentally set one off.
  114: You find nothing while searching the strongbox for traps.
  115: You successfully disarmed the trap.
  116: You accidentally set off the trap.
  117: You failed to disarm the trap.
AIRLOCK:
  100: |-
    This vault looks particularly scavenged. You
     think to yourself that nothing of value could
     possibly remain.
KNIGHTB:
  100: Knight
  101: I wonder what the old turbine engines were really like.
  102: Boy, I wish we had an automobile.
  103: |-
    Did you know that man has been on the moon? Or, at least,
     I think that's what they said.
  104: |-
    Can you imagine what life would be like without technology?
     Well, I guess you've probably seen things pretty close to that.
  105: I can't find the file I need.
  106: I'll be a Paladin someday.
  107: |-
    Talus is a skilled warrior. I would never want to have to
     go up against him.
  108: |-
    Thomas is the best fighter in the Brotherhood. I bet he could
     kick Rhombus's butt.
  109: |-
    I'd like to get my hands on those raiders. Show them what
     thieves deserve.
  110: That's it . . . what? Oh, sorry. I can't talk right now.
  111: |-
    I wonder what would happen if I . . . huh? Oh, you made
     me lose my train of thought.
SCIROOM:
  100: This room once belonged to esteemed scientists.
BOOKCASE:
  100: |-
    The bookshelf is filled with religious and philosophy books. The
     bookshelf is very dusty.
  101: "You take a book down, examine it and quickly replace it on the shelf. \n The
    shelf itself seems very sturdy."
  102: You find a hidden latch.
  103: That does nothing.
  104: The wall next to the bookshelf quietly slides out of the way.
  105: |-
    You fumble with the bookcase for a moment but you fail to accomplish
     anything.
  200: The bookshelf is filled with religious and philosophy books.
  201: The latch will not budge.
GUARD2:
  100: You see Garret. He is watching you closely.
  101: Fix the water pump now or die.
  102: Good job!
  103: Get back here and fix this water pump!
BYGREG:
  100: You see a man, he quickly stares intensely into your eyes and then away.
  101: You see Greg.
  102: What?  Why are you talking to me? They'll hear you know.
  103: Hi, your back.  Don't talk so loud, they're out there.
  104: Ok, but keep it down, they'll come for both of us if you don't stop shouting.
  105: Who are you?
  106: Why are you so jumpy?
  107: I think they need to up your medication.
  108: Never mind.
  109: I'm...Greg...but don't let anyone else know, or they'll come find me.
  110: Jumpy, I'm not jumpy.  Just careful.  They all say I'm paranoid, but I'm the
    one that's gonna be here when they come to get us.
  111: Come to get you?  Who is coming to get you?
  112: You certainly are paranoid, I'll talk to you later.
  113: Well they are...You know don't you...The disease was just the start.  Now they're
    going to come and take as all.  But you are just like all the rest.  You won't
    believe me, and you'll be doomed.  You mark my words.   I'LL STILL BE HERE, and
    ALL OF THIS, INCLUDING YOU, WILL BE TAKEN.  TAKEN. [Greg grasps his head and curls
    up in a ball, squealing and thrashing about]
  114: Medication...Oh so you're one of them, trying to get me to take my medication
    again....Well you won't get me to.  I WON'T TAKE IT, NO, I WON'T.  THE VOICES,
    NO I WON'T, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME. [Greg close his eyes shut and clutches his head
    frantically, talking with the voices that only he can hear.]
  115: YOU CAN'T MAKE ME!
  116: NOTHING YOU CAN DO WILL HELP!
  117: IT'S ALL OVER!
  118: THEIR COMING, AND YOU CAN'T STOP THEM!
  119: IT WILL GET YOU ALL!
MARNEY:
  100: You see Dr. Solone, M.D.
  101: You see Nurse Marney.
  102: You see a doctor.
  103: You see a nurse.
  104: Welcome. How might I help you today?
  105: Hurrgh.
  106: I'm hurt. Can you fix me up?
  107: Can you teach me about medicine?
  108: |-
    Yes, I see that you are suffering from some damage. This
     may take some time. Would you like me to try to mend your
     wounds?
  109: Uh huh.
  110: Nuh uh.
  111: Yes, please.
  112: No, thank you.
  113: |-
    There you go. That should have you all set. Please be more
     careful out there.
  114: You're good at that. Can you teach me about trauma care?
  115: Okay. Thank you.
  116: |-
    I can teach you a little. But it will take several hours. Are you
     willing to stay?
  117: Yes.
  118: Sorry, too busy.
  119: |-
    You are a very good student. I hope you remain on our
     side. Good bye.
  120: As you wish. Good luck out there.
  121: |-
    I can teach you a little, but not much. It will take some time.
     Are you willing to stay?
  122: Yes.
  123: I'm sorry, but I lack extra time.
  124: You are an excellent student. Good luck to you.
  125: Nothing right now. Thanks though.
DANE:
  100: You see a big, strong, burly man.
  101: Didn't we just meet? Have you come to kill me?
  102: I know fathers aren't supposed to hug their sons, but I love you, dad!
  103: Master, was this what I was supposed to become, Master?
  104: There ain't nothin' like a Dane..
  105: What's your favorite color, friend? Mine is milk!
  106: You're an idiot, Dane. They're going to kill you soon and you deserve it! Weakling!
    Weakling!
  107: Mother, did you think they'd drop a bomb?
  108: They did it with grace and such aplomb!
  109: My name is Dane, it is not Tom!
  110: Your poetry sucks, man! It sucks! Sucks! Sucks!
  111: I like Mr. Handy! I want to have sex with his cute little hands . . .
  112: I'm crazy. I've gone crazy. Oh my god, I have gone completely nuts! Think about
    peace! Think about Unity!
  113: I want a horse! I need a horse! Bring me a horse, dammit! A horse!
  114: They're watching us even now! Mr. Nightkin! Felix and Timothy! Cats! Dogs!
    Nightkin!
  115: Shut up! They'll think you're a crazy asshole! You gotta get yourself together!
  116: Lasher! You gotta kill Lasher! Save the kid! Poor little Flower Child. Poor
    me.
  117: Shut up you son of a bitch! Pull yourself together!
  118: "[Singing off-key] Once, I was lost, and now I see! No more baptism now for
    me!"
  119: You know, I once overheard Morpheus shaking his fist at Nightkin. Or did I
    smell it?
  120: You're fools to cry for me. Never cry over spilled milk . . . or damaged goods.
  121: Does anyone know how to fix a toaster?
  122: Of course they do, idiot! It's your head they can't fix, you son of a bitch!
  123: It's the guns, you asshole! Gunpowder is intelligent and evil and controls
    your brain! The more gunpowder that's near you, the crazier you become! BOOM!
    BOOM! BOOM!
  124: " . . . I just want to set the world on fiiiiiiiyaaah!!!"
  125: You wanna rassle? I used to be real good at it . . . until the Nightkin beat
    me. Took two of them, though. Nightkin are real strong!
  126: They're mutants, you fool! Of course they're strong!
  127: So are penguins. And gyro buffalo. They shoot them out of great big bison guns.
    You gotta watch out for those buffalo women. They'll drop a bison on you so fast,
    you won't know what hit you! Ha!
  128: Don't I know you from somewhere? Does your brain hurt, too?
  129: Of course you know him, Dane, you idiot! He's our enemy! He must be destroyed!
  529: Of course you know her, Dane, you idiot! She's our enemy! She must be destroyed!
  130: Don't mind him, he's an asshole. I love you. Do you love me?
  131: I used to live in Penticton, British Columbia. Or maybe I saw it on a map of
    the old days. Those were good old days. Wish I'd been alive back then . . .
  132: Aren't you tired of talking with me? Hasn't this just been incredibly tedious?
  133: Aren't you tired of talking with yourself, you schizo bastard?
  134: I hate myself. I want to die, but you're counting on me. Counting on me to
    say something that makes all of my bullshit mean something! Something important!
  135: Why can't I be the important one for a change?
  136: MOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO!
  137: MOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO!
  138: I'm bored. What's worse, I've been screwed over. It isn't fun anymore. You
    ever got the feeling you were just strings and they didn't bother to hang you?
    I'm all over the floor!
  139: MOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO!
  140: Enough with the brahmin! You'll start smelling like them! Then everyone will
    just puke!
  141: I used to be insane, you know, until I went through the Servitor process. I
    used to be insane, but now I'm just in pieces. Pieces! Pieces!
  142: Son of a bitch, I'm a puzzle! Will you help me put myself together?
  143: I can't believe someone's still talking with me . . .
  144: It's all a game, you see. A game, and I'm one of the pieces. And a kid got
    real angry, and so he started stepping on me. Step and step and step and step,
    and finally I just broke!
  145: Maybe they'll scoop out my brain! Scoop out my brain and turn me into their
    pet! Here, Dane! Catch the ball, Dane! Sic 'em, Dane! Sic 'em, Dane! Sic 'em,
    Dane! Execute them, you brain-dead dog!
  146: Why do you think they call him Master?
  147: Life sucks, but death sucks worse, and we can't go back in time to stop our
    birth, so what's the point?
  148: I think they get the point, asshole! They know the Servitor process screws
    you! They know this 'baptism machine' just messes . . .
  149: My name is Dane. I am a Viking. I like ducks. I rape and pillage! Will you
    rape and pillage with me?
  150: Oh God! Master, not God! At least I remember my own name. At least I still
    have that. Most of the other failures didn't, before they shot them. Not pretty
    corpses either. Nightkin target practice!
  151: And then there were the ones who lost their minds completely. I wish they were
    dead.
  152: I think I'll call my first child Fallout. I had a son once, but the radiation
    ate him in his mommy's womb.
  153: Asshole! You just laughed! You didn't give a shit about him or his mother before!
  154: Mutants can't breed. And we're all going to become mutants! Don't you know
    what that means! The world will be sterile! Sterile! Sterile! We won't breed!
    We'll all die!
  155: Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Somebody make him stop!
  156: Master! I shouldn't have said anything. I heard the Nightkin crying and I felt
    sorry for it.
  157: What is evil? Evil is when good gets completely screwed up! Evil is when brave
    people can't be brave anymore! Evil is an anagram of vile! There's got to be a
    moral standard somewhere!
  158: Shut up, asshole! Moral standards! It sure as Hell ain't here!
  159: You know, I used to think religion was a noble calling, and maybe it is; but
    you can't walk into it blindly, or they'll take control of your brain.
  160: ". . . zombies are a disgrace to God, you know."
  161: But why does God make people who break so easily?
  162: I think I can finally answer some questions now. Sorry it took so long.
  163: What's this place used for?
  164: Tell me about the Nightkin.
  165: What's going on around here?
  166: What did they do to you?
  167: Who is the Master?
  168: Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.
  169: You sound stupid!
  170: This is the baptismal. They make Servitors here. When acolytes have been indoctrinated,
    they bring them here and they go through the process. A few of them survive .
    . .
  171: Most lose their minds, but they're still useful. They throw them downstairs,
    rant at them about the Master and walk around in a stupor. You've seen the zombies.
    Great slave labor -- and soldiers . . .
  172: John Brown's body is molderin' in the Grave. John Brown's body is molderin'
    in the Grave, John Brown's body is a-molderin' in the Grave, and the Master's
    screwing us overrrrr . . .
  173: Stop that. It's getting real difficult to hold myself together.
  174: Tell me about the Nightkin.
  175: What's going on around here?
  176: What did they do to you?
  177: Who is the Master?
  178: Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.
  179: Ooops! I can't keep myself together anymore! Whee! Whee! Whee!
  180: They're mutants. I've heard them talk. I'm very sneaky. I know all their secrets.
    They hate me. Hate me very much.
  181: I'm screwed, but this is only Phase 1 of the Cathedral Screwover Plan. When
    servitors get completely brainwashed, they got to Phase 2. That's when the Master
    baptizes them in the FEV-2!
  182: Most die right there. But those who survive become mutants. BIG mutants. Nightkin!
    The Master thinks that only the Nightkin can survive. He wants to make everyone
    Nightkin because they're tough!
  183: You know all this peace and unity bullshit? It really isn't bullshit to the
    Master. He really thinks that he's saving the world!
  184: Sterile! We're all going to be hideous, sterile freaks! Sterile! Sterile! Sterile!
    My name's not Errol! Sterile!
  185: Tell me about the Nightkin.
  186: What's going on around here?
  187: What did they do to you?
  188: Who is the Master?
  189: Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.
  190: MOOOO! MOOOOO! MOOOO! Brahmin Nightkin, coming through! Here comes some sterile
    milk!
  191: The end of the world as we know it. Mutant armies in the Vault, don't blame
    me, it's the Master's fault. When we have Unity, that's when the Master's fun
    REALLY begins.
  192: Tell me about the Nightkin.
  193: What kind of fun?
  194: What did they do to you?
  195: Who is the Master?
  196: Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.
  197: Ooops! I can't keep myself together anymore! Whee! Whee! Whee!
  198: Dumped me in chemicals, filled me full of holes, played loud noises for me.
    That sort of shit. Tried to make me into something I'm not. Parents do that all
    the time.
  199: I hurt real bad.
  200: What's this place used for?
  201: Tell me about the Nightkin.
  202: What's going on around here?
  203: Who is the Master?
  204: Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.
  205: You sound stupid!
  206: |-
    I used to hurt people bad, too. I was a stud! Hell, I
    was a god! A tough god son of a bitch! But it wasn't enough!
    I was a goose-stepping fighting machine! But now I'm . . . I'm . . . help me . . .
  207: |-
    You know, the Nightkin say he's uglier than they are.
    That means he must be one hideous son of a bitch.
  208: |-
    He's the Man! The Man with the Plan!
    He plans because he loves us! And if the world gets
    in his way, screw it! Because that's what love is all
    about!
  209: What's this place used for?
  210: Tell me about the Nightkin.
  211: What's going on around here?
  212: What did they do to you?
  213: Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.
  214: You sound stupid!
  215: Love is what makes the cactus grow! Love is what makes the brahmin moo! Love
    is screwing, it's screwing your life! I hate love! I love hate! If the Master
    hated us, we'd be all right!
  216: Where is your conscience, man? Do you think that life's supposed to be some
    pretty picture without any misery in it? Life IS misery! Misery, and whatever
    the Hell we decide to do about it!
  217: Coping! Loving! Screwing! Hating! Taking chances! Boring people! Bashing assholes!
    Making friends with other assholes! Running away from your mistakes! Facing your
    mistakes! Radiation!
  218: Having kids and doing the same thing over again, sometimes better, sometimes
    worse!
  219: That is life, man! It's like being drunk; look at it one way, and it's a piss
    poor embarrassment! Look at it a different way and it feels great! But it's all
    the same thing! It's all life!
  220: Ah ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! You're right! We're all stupid! Don't you get it? Ha!
    Ha! Ha!
  221: I'm a little bitter right now. Like Orange Pekoe left out in the rain. Ha!
    I like that saying! I think I'll keep repeating it! I'm a little bitter right
    now. Like Orange Pekoe left out in the rain . . .

SETH2:
  100: You see Seth, the guide back to Shady Sands.
  101: Let's hurry and get rid of these Radscorpions.
  102: Let's get back to Shady Sands and let them know the Radscorpions are gone.
SMONE:
  100: You see two super mutants. One looks hurt, and the other is tending him.
  101: Well, how do you feel now?
  102: |-
    [moves his shoulder] Ah, it's still a little sore. At least the
     bleeding stopped.
  103: Good, good. Keep using your medication and you should be good as new.
  104: |-
    Excellent. When I get my hands on that little human, I'm going to
     crush him.
  105: |-
    Excellent. When I get my hands on that little human, I'm going to
     crush her.
  106: He sure did enough damage that last time. I hope they get him soon.
  107: She did enough damage that last time. I hope they get her soon.
  108: Imagine if all of our plans were ruined because of one little human.
  109: "[laughs] Yeah, that would be a shame."
  110: "[chuckles]"
MUTDISK:
  100: You see a disk with some strange marking on it.
  101: 'PIPBoy displays: Information already stored.'
  102: 'PIPBoy displays: Downloading data.'
HIGHTOWR:
  100: You see Daren Hightower.
  101: Who are you?!?  And who let you in?
  102: I have a message from a friend.
  103: Your life is in danger, and I need to speak with you.
  104: 'My name is '
  105: ".  Leon let me in."
  106: My name?... Death!
  107: I'm your worst nightmare.
  108: BoBo?
  109: I have no friends.  What is your message?
  110: Decker sends his regards.
  111: Um... Bob sent me... ah... he said you overpaid him 100 caps and sent me to
    give it to you.
  112: There is no message really, I was just trying to talk my way out of this.
  113: I love you.
  114: Tell me somthing I don't know, you moron!
  115: Moron?  I was trying to help you.  You can go to Hell.
  116: Decker wants you dead and he hired me to do it.
  117: You obviously don't know that you're about to die!
  118: Forget it.  I was just trying to help.
  119: 'It''s been a pleasure meeting you '
  120: ".  Now my assistant Leon will see you out of my home."
  121: I don't know any Bob, but I'll take the 100 caps and you can leave.
  122: Go to hell!
  123: OK, here you go.  Thanks for your time.
  124: Uhh...  That BASTARD Bob didn't give me enough caps!  I'll get 'em for you
    Mr. Hightower, honest I will!
  125: |-
    Think nothing of it.  I always enjoy strangers coming into my home and giving me money.  Leon, show this fool the door!
     Come back again, and my guards will have your head!
  126: Leon, show this fool the door!  Come back again, and my guards will have your
    head!
  127: Guards!  Assassin!

PRISONR:
  100: You see a ghoul prisoner.
  101: Wha-what do you want.
  102: Uh, nothing.
  103: Hng.
  104: I'm here to let you out.
  105: What'd you expect.
  106: Hey, I don't care about that, just get me outta here!
  107: Great! Do it!
  108: I stole some water. Hey, I was thirsty! It wasn't like I hurt somebody.
  109: You took more than your rightful share.
  110: Ah, that's nothing. I'll get you out.
  111: |-
    I would've died without the water. It was only a cupful.
     Just enough to keep me alive. You gotta get me out of here!
     I'm going insane.
  112: Ok, hold on a moment.
  113: I think I'll let the authorities deal with you.
  114: Please let me go.
  115: Thanks for letting me out.
  116: No prob.
  117: Where does the water come from?
  118: Ya.
  119: |-
    They pump it up from the wells below. There is a manhole
     in the cell next door that leads to the old vault. This is
     the source of the water. If it wasn't for those
     ones below, we would be a lot better off.
  120: What do you mean?
  121: Thanks.
  122: |-
    It's difficult to make the old tech work properly, sometimes.
     The glowing ones lash out whenever we go down there. Us ghouls
     just leave them alone. And the big mutants don't seem to care one bit.
  123: Good luck. Bye.
  124: 'You gained '
  125: " experience points for freeing the ghoul prisoner."
  126: Thanks again.
DOGMEAT:
  100: You see Dogmeat.

  102: "[Sniff. Sniff.] Grrrr! Snarl!"
  103: "[Sniff. Sniff] Woof!"
CURTIS:
  100: You see a weather-beaten farmer.
  101: Good day.
  102: Hello.
  103: Hubip.
  104: Hello again.
  105: What can I do for you?
  106: What's your name?
  107: What can you tell me about your village?
  108: What are you doing?
  109: Nothing, thanks.
  110: I am called Curtis.
  111: |-
    Our village is small, but we support ourselves. Aside from
     the attacks by raiders and the occasional Rad Scorpion,
     we have no problems. Aradesh is a good leader.
  112: |-
    I am a farmer. We irrigated the desert many years ago.
     Although the wasteland is harsh, it is possible to
     grow things with patience and time.
  113: I see. You seem to be doing pretty well.
  114: |-
    You have all of your fields planted right now? You could
     probably do better with crop rotation.
  115: Crop rotation? What's that?
  116: Never mind.
  117: |-
    You only plant some of your fields, allowing the others to get
     back some of the nutrients that the plants used up. You let the other fields
     become fertile again by just tilling up whatever grows there.
  118: Huh. Never thought of that. Makes sense, though. Good idea.
  119: Can I ask you another question?
  200: |-
    You gain 500 experience points for helping to improve the
     agriculture of Shady Sands.
DEADGUY:
  100: You see a Hubbian.
  101: |-
    I can't believe I'm alive and I CAN'T believe you took them all out! Wait, what am I saying?  I'm alive,
     aren't I? I'll believe anything you tell me right now.
  102: I'm going to kill you now.
  103: Give me all your money!
  104: Clean up your life and get out of here or I'll finish you off, too!
  105: Uk?
  106: Uh, but?  You? (sigh) Okay, do it quickly please. I hate pain.
  107: Don't hurt me!
  108: Okay.  (He gives you 20 hub bucks.)  Can I go now?
  109: Yes.
  110: No.
  111: Uh, why?
  112: Because I said so!  Do you have a problem with that?
  113: Okay, you can leave.
  114: No, sorry, sir!  Please don't hurt me -- I don't like pain!
  115: No, sorry, ma'am!  Please don't hurt me -- I don't like pain!
  118: Are you stupid? I mean, thanks an awful lot for saving my life, kind sir.  I've
    got to be going now. Bye.
  119: Are you stupid? I mean, thanks an awful lot for saving my life, kind ma'am.  I've
    got to be going now. Bye.
  122: Yes . . . yes . . . yes sir.  I'll never do anything bad, ever again!  I .
    . . I won't cheat. I won't lie, blackmail, rob, murder or kidnap.
  123: Yes . . . ye . . . yes ma'am.  I'll never do anything bad, ever again!  I .
    . . I won't cheat. I won't lie, blackmail, rob, murder or kidnap.
  126: Just get out of here!
  127: You're a liar!
  128: Yes, sir!
  129: Yes, ma'am!
SECDISK:
  100: This seems strange. It looks like it can be used in your Pip Boy.
  101: 'Pip Boy displays: File Found on System. Aborting download.'
  102: 'Pip Boy displays: Downloading data from Disk.'
LT:
  100: You see the Lieutenant of the Master's army.
  101: |-
    Now what do we have here? I've been told you wish to divulge
     information of the utmost importance. I do hope so.
  102: Uh, yeah.
  103: Not to someone as ugly as you.
  104: On one condition.
  105: Doh!
  106: |-
    An insult. How droll. I'd define that word for you,
     but that would be a waste, wouldn't it. Let's get to your two choices:
     You can tell me what I want to know. Or I can do it . . . my way.
  107: I'll take 'none of the above.'
  108: Okay, but on one condition.
  109: |-
    All right, I'll tell you. It's on the other side of the mountains,
     far to the north. You'll find it near a strange, half-dome type rock . . .
     Now, what do I get?
  110: |-
    I don't believe I offered. But I will give you my thanks for
     telling me where your Vault is. I'm sure the Master will be . . . ever so grateful.
  111: How nice for us both. Now, if you please, the location of your Vault.
  112: It's uh . . . it's uh . . .
  113: On one condition, pal.
  114: Fooled ya, didn't I? I'll never tell you!
  115: Okay, okay! Just don't kill me! I'll tell you everything I know!
  116: |-
    Conditions? How delightful. Go ahead, amuse me with
     your . . . condition.
  117: I want to go free.
  118: Put a bag over your head so I can stand being in your presence.
  119: I want to be able to ask you some questions first.
  120: |-
    What a splendid sense of humor. Pity I don't have one.
     So . . . the location of your Vault, if you please.
  121: All right, but can I ask you some questions first?
  122: I'm not telling and you can't make me.
  123: It's uh . . . it's uh . . .
  124: Why certainly, my dear human. I'm curious just to see what you'll ask.
  125: What is it you do here?
  126: Who do you work for?
  127: What do you want me for?
  128: How about I just leave now.
  129: |-
    My dear human, this is the great procreator! Here we'll make
     others of the master race and insure the Unity. It's all quite glorious,
     I assure you.
  130: Tell me about the Unity.
  131: Sounds like it. Why do you need all this to, uh, procreate?
  132: So, who's in charge?
  133: |-
    Presently, there is a slight . . . problem in the reproductive
     process. It's being attended to. For now, we must use the Vats to turn
     humans into Super Mutants. You'll experience that glory yourself momentarily.
  134: Oh, goody. A few more questions before I . . . glow?
  135: How could I possibly refuse a request phrased like that?
  136: Certainly. We have all the time in the world . . . Trust me.
  137: |-
    The Unity is our goal. It is quite simple, really.
     Certainly, even you have noticed the steady downhill slide of civilization?
  138: Well ,yeah, but . . .
  139: |-
    The Super Mutant is the next advancement in human evolution.
     To save the world, we will convert all the worthy individuals.
     Simple, efficient, glorious.
  140: So you're making everyone into big, green, ugly mutants to save the world?
  141: How are you more advanced?
  142: But there's no choice involved.
  143: |-
    Your human mind is rather under-equipped to handle this,
     so a simple yes will suffice for now. Soon everyone in the world will
     be converted, and peace will reign.
  144: But what about free will?
  145: You're telling me there will be no war?
  146: |-
    Did you make the choice to be born into this ash covered world?
     We, the Super Mutants, are the best prepared for the world to come.
     What is free choice compared to life?
  147: Debatable point. But how are you more prepared than normal humans?
  148: But it's evil to force people to live your way!.
  149: |-
    Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer. We are
     highly intelligent and immune to disease. The strong survive! It is our
     goal to improve the human race.
  150: Pretty lofty goal. How are you made like this?
  151: |-
    Ahh, the wonders of technology. Before the war, the human
     scientists made a chem called FEV. It was designed to make the perfect human.
  152: So you're the perfect human?
  153: |-
    Better. More than human. I, too, was once human.
     Like you, I was a slug, wallowing in the mud before being exposed to
     FEV and undergoing my glorious transformation.
  154: So you're planning on dipping everyone in this FEV?
  155: Exactly. Now you see.
  156: Uh, sure I do. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  157: But it's wrong!
  158: |-
    Oh, how disappointing. I'd so hoped you would see the light
     before . . . Well, when you are one of us, I'm certain you'll understand.
     Then you'll embrace the Unity.
  159: Never! It's evil. Evil, I tell you!
  160: Maybe. Can I ask you a few more questions first?
  161: |-
    No war and no sickness. All Super Mutants are bound by the
     Unity. We are the hope for the world.
  162: Sounds delusional to me.
  163: How are you the hope of the world?
  164: |-
    We all work for the Master to uphold the glory of the Unity.
     He was the first, you see.
  165: How did you come to work for him?
  166: What's the Unity?
  167: |-
    Fate. Luck of the draw. I was the strongest of my batch
     to be dipped in the virus, and I have always supported the ideals of
     the Unity and the Master, for he is right. And for my devotion, I
     have been rewarded.
  168: What virus?
  169: So what's this Master like?
  170: |-
    Before the war, the humans made a virus called FEV to create
     the perfect man. They were successful, as you can plainly see. The Master
     has been the first to truly utilize the FEV to its full potential.
  171: So where is this Master?
  172: How does it work?
  173: |-
    He's busy with the Children of the Cathedral. They actually
     consider us gods. But then, who can blame them.
  174: My, aren't we conceited?
  175: You think you're gods?
  176: |-
    Is honesty conceit? We're the next step in evolution.
     Through our Unity, the world will survive. Where is the conceit in that?
  177: How about inside that grotesque head of yours?
  178: Well, whatever you say. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  179: Of course not. We are simply the future.
  180: I don't believe you.
  181: |-
    Before the future comes, there're a couple of other things I'm
     curious about.
  182: |-
    Oh, I suspect that's far above your ability to comprehend.
     But not to worry. Soon your eyes will be opened to a whole new life.
  183: What do you mean!?
  184: |-
    Before that happens, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious
     about.
  185: |-
    [The Lieutenant sighs.] Haven't you figured it out yet?
     You're a prime normal. Soon you'll be one of us.
  186: How does 'no way' sound?
  187: |-
    Before I become a dip like you, there's a couple of other things that
     I'm curious about.
  188: Why am I a prime human ?
  189: Go ahead, ask your questions. We are in no hurry.
  190: |-
    He was our guide to the life-giving virus, and he is Father
     to us all. And he so wants to meet you. I hope you're honored.
  191: Uh . . . okay. What about that virus? What is it?
  192: Before bestowing this honor, how about answering more questions?
  193: Where is he?
  194: |-
    The FEV was mutated by the war radiation. Those living
     in this desolate wasteland have been exposed to this mutant FEV,
     essentially inoculating them from the full effects.
  195: So?
  196: So you need those who are uncontaminated in order to make Super Mutants?
  197: |-
    So, you're from a Vault and have limited exposure to
     this mutated virus. The original FEV in the Vats should work quite well on you.
  198: And how do you know this?
  199: |-
    We have done extensive experiments on humans to reach
     this conclusion. My master has been searching for unopened Vaults to
     prove his theories. And now you've come along. How thoughtful of you.
  200: You won't find it.
  201: |-
    Well before that happens, there's a couple of other things that I'm
     curious about.
  202: |-
    Oh, my, you are brighter than I thought. Now you know why
     we need your Vault.
  203: Too bad you won't get it.
  204: It's a big Vault. How about some more small answers first?
  205: |-
    Going? I believe . . . let me check . . . Why, yes, I almost
     laughed! How wonderfully humorous. The only place you're going is the Vat.
     But first, you'll tell me where your Vault is.
  206: I hope you can take rejection.
  207: We shall see, won't we?
  208: |-
    Oddly enough, I do believe you do not intend to tell me. We'll
     have to correct that!
  209: |-
    Feel better now? Since torture is such a crass, yet oddly
     satisfying and effective technique, I'll ask you once more nicely.
     Where . . . is . . . the Vault!
  210: I'm. Not. Telling.
  211: You win. It's across the mountains to the west. I'll draw you a map.
  212: I rather hoped you'd say that.
  213: |-
    How was that? In a more . . . chatty mood? Now where were we?
     Oh, of course . . . the Vault.
  214: It's . . . it's . . . in your dreams.
  215: You win. It's across the mountains to the west. I'll draw you a map.
  216: |-
    Ah, I feel much better. And you? . . . Now, be a good little
     human and tell me where your Vault is. This is getting most tedious.
  217: Go to hell.
  218: I'll tell! Just don't hurt me anymore!
  219: |-
    I do so admire your will. Guards, take him back to
     his cell and get him ready for dipping. He'll tell
     us where his Vault is when he is one of us.
  220: If you're so sure I'll tell after dipping, then why all of this?
  221: |-
    Well, you see, there is this minor drawback. Sometimes,
     not always, a person's memory is, um . . . how shall we say,
     interrupted by dipping. So there is a small chance you'll forget the location.
  222: So you can't afford to dip me.
  223: Looks like we're both screwed.
  224: |-
    Unfortunately, at this point, I have to take the chance.
     I do need that information.
  225: I'll tell.
  226: You'd better hope I forget. Because if I remember any of this, your ass is
    mine.
  227: |-
    Excellent. I believe you understand. So you're sure you want
     to tell where the Vault is? Torture can be so enjoyable.
  228: Yes, I'm sure.
  229: Now that you mention it, no.
  230: Can I ask you a few questions first?
  231: I thought you might see it my way. No second thoughts?
  232: I'll tell you everything.
  233: Yes, I changed my mind and I'll never tell.
  234: Can I ask you a few questions, first?
  235: |-
    Oh, this is excellent. You know, I actually doubted my
     officers when they said they'd captured a prime normal. It is so nice to see you.
  236: Go to hell.
  237: What do you want with me?
  238: Duh!
  239: |-
    Yes, you do have a way with words, don't you. And words are
     what we want, before . . .
  240: What do you mean 'before?'
  241: You won't get anything from me!
  242: |-
    Why, when you become one of us, of course! I can't have
     a perfectly good prime normal and not make it one of the Chosen Ones,
     now can I? After you tell me where your Vault is.
  243: Tell you? You're almost funny.
  244: On one condition.
  245: Oh, how commendable. Enough foolishness. Where is your Vault?
  246: I'm not telling.
  247: Well . . . on one condition.
  248: |-
    Well, I'm quite impressed. My spies told me you were resourceful
     but they seemed to have underestimated your talents. Guards, capture her!
  249: |-
    Ahh, had a nice nap? I do hope so. But now it's time to get
     down to business.
  250: Go to hell.
  251: What do you want with me?
  252: |-
    The mind simply boggles at your intellect. Why the legions haven't
     bowed down at your feet by now, I'll never understand. Guards, take this
     idiot away!
  253: As I said . . .
  254: Like I told you before . . .
  255: Please listen closely this time. I said . . .
  256: I told you . . .
  257: |-
    You know, you remind me of a cockroach I once owned.
     I crushed it because I was annoyed with its scurrying little noises. Remember that.
  258: |-
    You're an annoying little human, aren't you?
     I'm not going to repeat it again.

    The Unity is the goal of all Super Mutants. Through the FEV
     virus, we will bring all of humanity together in peace.
  260: |-
    The FEV virus was discovered by the Master many years ago. It
     is what makes us the Chosen Ones. But you will soon learn that, I assure you.
  261: The Master is father to us all.
  262: |-
    Nothing but a device to further our plans. No matter, all humans
     will be Chosen . . . or dead.
  263: |-
    The Vats are where the FEV is stored, and where you normals
     become one of us. Of course, some die horrible, excruciatingly
     painful deaths, but well, those are the breaks.
  264: |-
    They are humans who have not been exposed to radiation. They tend
     to fare better in the Vats than others. You are a perfect example of this.
  265: |-
    They were constructed before the war. They are also our main
     source of Prime Normals.
  266: |-
    Morpheus. It's quite amusing. He thinks he's so much more than
     just a slug the Master recruited to head his Children of the Cathedral nonsense.
     Ah, well. He, too, will be dipped in the Vats and he'll probably die a horrible
     death . . . I hope.
  267: That's not important right now.
  268: That question is irrelevant to the Unity.
  269: I won't even dignify that with an answer.
  270: |-
    Well, I'm quite impressed. My spies told me you were resourceful,
     but they seemed to have underestimated your talents. Guards, capture him!
  271: |-
    Oh, I do so admire your will. Guards, take her away and prepare
     her for the dipping. She'll tell us where her Vault is when she is one of us.
  272: |-
    I do so admire your will. Guards, take him to his cell and

  102: A human spy!
  103: What are you doing down here?
  104: Hmm, not much. What are you doing?
  105: I'm looking around.
  106: Huh.
  107: Why, nothing. I live here.
  108: You won't find anything here. Go away.

MATHIA:
  100: You see Mathia.
  101: |-
    Hello, Initiate. So, you are the one who made it out
     of the Ancient Order alive.
  102: Wha?
  103: And who are you?
  104: Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Bye.
  105: |-
    The name is Mathia. I am officially Maxson's assistant, but
     I am also here to make sure no one messes with the old man.
  106: Old man? That sounds a bit disrespectful.
  107: What do you do as Maxson's assistant?
  108: Good to meet you. Bye.
  109: |-
    No, no, not at all. He's a good guy. (Jokingly) Besides,
     I wouldn't bad mouth him while he is standing next to me.
  110: So, what is it that you do for Maxson as his assistant.
  111: Goodbye.
  112: |-
    I take care of all the paper work. He could not do paper
     work to save his life. Also, if he clears a Weapons Upgrade for one
     of the Brothers, I process the order.
  113: Ok, thanks for the information.
  114: |-
    I can't believe an idiot like you is the one who made the
     Ancient Order run. Go figure.
  115: Hello again Initiate. How can I help you?
  116: Wha?
  117: I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
  118: Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Good day.
  119: Alright, let's go. (He grabs you by the arm)
  120: Uh huh.
  121: Uh uh.
  122: Alright, Alright. I'm moving.
  123: Get the hell away from me. I'm not going anywhere.
  124: |-
    Ok. Maxson has cleared a weapons upgrade for you. What would
     you like?
  125: Wha?
  126: Sniper Rifle.
  127: Rocket Launcher.
  128: Laser Pistol.
  129: Power Fist.
  130: Ripper.
  131: There you go. Glad you are on our side Initiate.
  132: |-
    The Elders have called a meeting. They wish you to meet them in the
     conference room right away.

  134: Ok, thank you.
  135: It's on this floor. The northeast corner, right behind the assembly hall.
BVLIB:
  100: |-
    This is the library. You've seen all this equipment
     before in your vault library.
  101: There looks to be little of value left in this room.
FIELDGEN:
  100: Your attempt to re-wire the field emitter fails.
  101: You turn off the field emitter.
MANAGER:
  100: You see the Ghoul Manager.
  101: Whatta you doing here?
  102: Searching for the remains of the future past.
  103: I'm an explorer.
  104: What's it to you, wormface?.
  105: Dug-duh.
  106: Whad you say?
  107: Nothing.

  120: Yes.
  121: No.
  122: "Musta been a pansie undergrounder. They letta you live so's you \n could pester
    me. Now getta outta my house."
  123: Well now you have. Getta outta here!
GAR2:
  100: You see Garret. He is watching you closely.
  101: Fix the water pump now, or die.
  102: Good job!
  103: Get back here and fix this water pump!
GATEDEMO:
  100: The guard is enraged and begins to attack.
  101: The guard is frightened by your power.
  102: Only Shadow Sword can intimidate this guard by his very presence. You must
    do so through words.
  103: You successfully swipe something from the guard.
  104: You have been spotted.
  105: The guard has nothing else on him.
  106: The guard is unaffected.
  107: A Junktown gate guard.
  108: What are you doing in Junktown, stranger?
  109: Looking for a little fun.
  110: Give me everything you have!
  111: Might you assist me in acquiring equipment?
  112: Nothing. Thank you. Good bye.
  113: |-
    There are a lot of things to do here. Let's see. You can practice your aim on the cows,
     or you can just wander around Junktown and see the sights, as long as you don't start any trouble.
  114: Is there anything else around here?
  115: Fine! Give me everything you have!
  116: Thank you. Good bye.
  117: |-
    Well, supposedly one of the old residents had a nasty gun hidden in his
     house, on the northwest side.  But nobody has every found it.
  118: Ok. Thank you for you time.
  119: Is there anything else?
  120: Ok, Ok, Ok. Please, don't hurt me.
  121: Not a chance! Die scum!!
  122: |-
    Well, supposedly the fellow who used to live in the building to the northwest had a pretty
     nasty gun.  Maybe you can find it.
  123: Sorry, I'm just a guard.  Try talking with some of the other residents.
  124: |-
    This is just a taste of things which you can do when the full game comes out. You can either:
     kill everything that gets in your way, pilfer and sneak your way through situations, or you can
     talk your way out of trouble and into the graces of others.
  125: When the full game comes out, you will be able to see more use of your skills
    than here.
MASTER:
  100: You see the Master of the Super Mutants.
  101: |-
    So, what shall it be?  Do you join the Unity or do you die here?
     Join! Die! Join! Die!
  102: I can't win.  I'll join you.
  103: |-
    If you can prove to me that your Unity is the best course for humanity,
     then I will help you.
  104: How about you die, then I leave?
  105: Oh, there will be death today, but not mine.  I've got a plan.
  106: Ugh. Lee.
  107: |-
    Excellent. Your talents will be useful. But first, you must tell me
     everything about your Vault.
  108: Why?
  109: OK.  I'll tell you everything you want to know.
  110: |-
    I will conquer it and turn all those pure strain humans into mutants.
     They will give me the army I need to bring peace to the entire wasteland.
  111: Sorry, I don't like that plan much.
  112: Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.
  113: So be it. You've dug your own grave. Grave! Grave!
  114: I don't have to prove anything to you! Prove.
  115: |-
    Your ego demands you tell me. All villains have this strange
     urge to explain everything.
  116: I can't know you represent the best future, unless you prove it to me.
  117: |-
    Very demanding for one in your tenuous position. But I can respect
     your needs.
  118: So tell me.
  119: |-
    The Unity will bring about the master race. Master! Master!
     One able to survive, or even thrive, in the wasteland. As long as there are
     differences, we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other. We
     need one race. Race! Race! One goal. Goal! Goal! One people . . . to
     move forward to our destiny. Destiny.
  120: That race being the mutants, of course.
  121: I hope we won't end up looking like you.
  122: |-
    Of course. Mutants are best equipped to deal with the world today.
     Who else? The ghouls. Please. Normals. They brought nuclear
     death to us all. This will be the age of mutants. Mutants.
  123: You mean to change all the others into mutants, as well.
  124: You're such a bigot.
  125: What about those who oppose you?
  126: |-
    All that resist, yes. All those that are required for the
     Unity as well. The remainder will be allowed to live out their days,
     but under Unity control and protection. But none shall breed, for they
     will be the last of their race.
  127: You've got a problem with your master plan.
  128: Sounds like you've got it under control.  I'll join up.
  129: I think you are, all of you are, nuts and I need to stop you now.
  130: And what is that?
  131: You didn't take into account me! I'm stopping you right here, right now!
  132: You can't possibly take on the entire world.
  133: I happen to know that your mutants are sterile.
  134: |-
    I'm not after the world, yet. When I turn your fellow vault-dwellers
     into mutants, my forces will be too strong for any to stand against!
     But don't worry, you won't care. Care! Care!
  135: |-
    Preposterous! The FEV-2 virus doesn't destroy the reproductive organs
     of those it mutates.
  136: Perhaps the virus didn't sterilize people once, but it does now.
  137: Have you talked to any of your mutants about this?
  138: Maybe it's all that extra radiation.
  139: Do you have proof?
  140: Of course, I do! Here it is . . .
  141: Take my word for it, it happens.
  142: Ask your own mutants.
  143: This proves nothing! You will pay for your insolence. Pay!
  144: I must digest this information. One moment.
  145: |-
    I must digest this information. One moment . . . I understand now.
     You made a clever forgery. You made this up to fool me. Fool! Me!
  146: What!? I don't understand, I thought it was correct!
  147: You're lying! You're denying the facts in front of you!
  148: You will pay for what you have done! Pay! Done.
  149: |-
    But it cannot be. This would mean that all my work has been for
     nothing. Everything that I have tried to . . . a failure!  It can't be.
     Be. Be. Be.
  150: |-
    Sorry, this isn't an option for you. Your race will die out
     after this generation.
  151: |-
    Maybe there is something that can be done. Perhaps you need more
     test subjects.
  152: Yes. More subjects. I think I shall start with you. Do! Do!
  153: |-
    I . . . don't think that I can continue. Continue? To have done the
     things I have done in the name of progress and healing. It was
     madness. I can see that now. Madness. Madness? There is no hope.
     Leave now, leave while you still have hope . . .
  154: I believe I shall. Don't move.
  155: |-
    My scientists assure me that nothing is wrong.
     What do you say to that? Say! Say!
  156: Did you think to ask a female mutant?
  157: Ask one of your Lieutenants.
  158: They're afraid of you. You think they'll tell you the truth?
  159: |-
    One moment. He cannot be reached. He must be dead and I can
     guess who killed him. Killed! Kill!
  160: |-
    He denies everything. And he says he knows who started
     this rumor . . .
  161: I think I know who the liar is. Liar!
  162: |-
    Reasonable. One moment. Are you sure? What about the other females?
     It cannot be. Be.
  163: Sorry, your race is doomed.
  164: Excuse me while I gloat . . . Told ya so!
  165: |-
    Without any proof, I'm afraid I can't believe you. Now, you will join
     my army as a mutant or you will die! Die! Join!
  166: Better dead than like you.
  167: It means giving up everything I know, but I'll join.
  168: |-
    Your humor will not save you now. Do you accept my offer, or not? Not!
     Accept!
  169: Not.
  170: OK, it's better than dying . . .
  171: |-
    Radiation has no effect on us. The FEV virus makes us immune.
     Your argument is weak, and so are you.
  172: |-
    Oh, I think you are wrong. But just to be sure, I will order
     this matter researched. After I have taken care of you. Care. Care!
  173: My only problem is you. Now, will you work for the Unity, or not?
  174: Not.
  175: Sure.
  176: They will be punished for their insolence.
  177: You mean to kill them all?
  178: Then I must stop you now!
  179: |-
    Of course not. Most will be offered a chance to become
     a mutant. Those who deny this opportunity will be sterilized and let go.
     Those that resist will be executed.
  180: You are one sick puppy. Time to put you down.
  181: Hmm, I'm not big on being executed . . . I'm joining.
  182: |-
    We are all biased, are we not?  We each care more about
     our individual communities than other people. We haven't changed, and
     I'll tell you something else . . .
  183: What's that?
  184: |-
    We won't change. Not unless we are of one people. One. One. One. One
     race. One. One. One. The Unity will allow us to move beyond these
     petty concerns and deal with the major problems at hand.  You want to
     be a part of that, don't you? Part. Don't.
  185: You've convinced me. I'll join the Unity.
  186: I want a part of you . . . your head!
  187: |-
    Of course! The mutants will survive! The mutants will rebuild this
     world! And only as a mutant, will you be allowed to live! Live. Die!
  188: Live!
  189: Die!
  190: All you care about is your mutants and their Unity.
  191: I am no villain. You have no idea what I, or the Unity is about.
  192: Then tell me what you are about.
  193: You are a villain. You're just denying your inner feelings.
  194: "I don't have to prove myself to you. Using your logic, that must,\n prove
    I am not a villain. It would be a hopeless cause to explain it to you. "
  195: Oh? Please, what sort of plan might that be?
  196: |-
    I'm going to set off a nuclear device in this Vault. It will explode
     shortly, taking you all to hell!
  197: I'll kill you and that'll make it difficult for you to continue, right?
  198: |-
    I convinced the Brotherhood of Steel to invade this place if I was
     captured and not set free.  They will be here any moment.
  199: |-
    You might be telling the truth. It doesn't matter, but I will let
     you go for now.
  200: 'You are lying. It will be the last lie that you tell. '
  201: |-
    One moment while I check out your story. You might be telling the
     truth. Guards! Take this human to the reactor core. Deal with the
     problem before it's too late.
  202: |-
    I doubt even the FEV will help you. Why am I talking? It's
     unlikely you even understand . . .
  203: 'You must be joking. '
  204: |-
    My patience is almost at an end with you. Now, will you join the
     Unity or not? Join. Not!
  205: Yes.
  206: No.
  207: Fine. Then you can die here and now!
  208: |-
    You have disarmed the device. Excellent. Tell me, is there
     anything you wanted to say before I kill you?
  209: Yes, can I join up with you now?
  210: Even dead, I'll still look better than you.
  211: No. No. No. No.
  212: I am the Master. I don't have to answer to you.
  213: I am not here to answer your questions. You are here to answer mine.
  214: |-
    Once I have the location of your vault, I will fulfill my destiny!
     Destiny! Destiny! Destiny!
  215: You think you can destroy me!? Destroy! Me?
  300: Duh!
  980: I am the Master. I don't have to answer to you.
  1000: Unity
  1001: Master
  1100: I am the Master. I don't have to answer to you.
  1101: I am not here to answer your questions. You are here to answer mine.
VALTOP:
  100: |-
    This is the Operations room. All command and control operations
     are performed here. These people are the leaders of the Vault.
PEASANTC:
  100: Get out of here!
  101: I've heard bad things about you, are they true?
  102: Hi.
  103: This is my place, wanna hang out for a while?
  104: Hmm, you look juicy . . .
  105: I hope you're not going to kick me out of here.
  106: No.
  107: That's a strange way to start a conversation.
  108: Hnnn.
  109: |-
    Oh, well, if you want to stay a while, go right ahead. I think we are
     safe here.
  110: |-
    Well, you gotta be careful these days. I hope you're having a better life
     than I am.
  111: |-
    Well, it's true. After what happened to my friends, I gotta protect my
     turf. I just hope you're not gonna kill me.
  112: No, I won't hurt you. Much.
  113: Why do you say that?
  114: Gack!
  115: No reason. Really.
  116: |-
    Those 'helpful' healing guys wanted my friend's place, so they took it.
     I don't know what happened to my friends.
  117: " And Killian is too busy to help me."
  118: " Killian is too busy cleaning up Gizmo's mess to help."
  119: " Gizmo laughed at me when I asked for his help."
  120: " There's nobody around to help me."
  121: Are you safe?
  122: That's a shame.
  123: I hope so, I really hope so.
  124: Please leave me alone!
THOMAS:
  100: You see Brother Thomas.
  101: Okay children. Today we will be going over some martial arts.
  102: |-
    In close combat the technique you use depends on your
     opponents size, reach, and quickness.
  103: If given the opportunity test your opponent.
  104: Don't rush the attack.
  105: All right my little one, try to hurt poor old gramps.
  106: Ah!
  107: Uhh.
  108: Well that's all for now, so let's review.
  109: You see how he lost his balance?
  110: Overextending yourself leaves you open for a counter attack.
  111: When you attack be sure not to overextend.
  112: Why is overextending so bad?
  113: If you have the opportunity for a kill, shouldn't you go for it?
  114: That's a lot to risk your life over.
  115: |-
    Overextending leaves your inside vulnerable to a counter attack
     and puts you off balance.
  116: One little shove will land you right on your ass.
  117: Okay, let's give another young punk a try at gramps.
  118: Let's see if you've learned from the previous example.
  119: Not bad, that last move almost got me.
  120: Are you sure you want to be a Scribe Initiate?
  121: Those talents would be a shame to waste.
  122: We'll just keep you in reserve. Okay?
  123: I'm just fooling with ya.
  124: You may want to reconsider a career as a Knight.
  125: Just think about it.
  126: Thank you Brother Thomas.
  127: |-
    I hope you all noticed how Brother Anthony did not overextend
     himself.
  128: He also tried to use my weight and bulkiness against me.
  129: Martial arts have their good and bad sides.
  130: |-
    We will be learning many different styles to better understand
     their strengths and weaknesses.
  131: Okay. Show me what you've got.
  132: Very good. You lasted much longer than I thought you would.
  133: You can go back to the line.
  134: Well, I hope you kids were able to catch what was going on.
  135: He's a natural fighter.
  136: Let's have one more.
  137: Pay close attention...
  138: and remember to always punch through your targets.
  139: |-
    Pretend your target is a few inches beyond were the impact is
     going to be.
  140: Um, Brother Thomas?
  141: Yes, my little piece of clay.
  142: Shouldn't we do that for kicking too?
  143: Of, course.
  144: Very good. I think we'll let you live.
  145: Just kidding, try to smile once in a while.
  146: This isn't a life and death situation.
  147: There'll be plenty of time for that later on.
  200: Not bad.
  201: That was pretty good.
  202: Okay, you're learning.
  203: Stay focused.
  204: Keep your eyes on me.
  205: Don't overextend.
  206: Never look away from your opponent.
  207: Work on your blocks.
  208: Keep your center of gravity low.
  209: Excellent!
  210: Perfect form.
  211: I'm impressed.
  300: You gain 500 experience points from watching the training.
BARTER:
  100: You see Barterman.
  101: Do you want to trade?
  102: Click Barter -->
  103: Nope.
  104: |-
    We have been plagued by Rad Scorpions for some time
     now. All who have been sent to destroy these
     monsters have not returned. I will give you weapons
     and armor if you will follow my guide to their lair
     and kill them all.
  105: Sounds good.
  106: No thanks.
  107: That is a shame. Please leave.
  108: "Excellent. Sammy here will guide you to the lair.\n Take these items, they
    will come in useful. "
  109: Please help us as soon as possible. Time is wasting.
  110: I don't talk to your kind, stranger.
FOLINIT:

  111: I can't wait to fight the Children
  112: If I can't be a Scholar, then I want to be a Scribe.
  113: I want to be a Scholar eventually.
  114: Those gangs out there really should stop fighting
  115: I wonder what the world would be like with peace.
  116: I hear that someone has been taking our knowledge to the Children.
  117: Those Nightkin scare me.
  118: Only scouts are allowed out after sunset.
  119: I wonder where the Scholars get their new books.
  120: We have lost a lot of people because of that spy.
  121: I overhead Neil say that the spy was probably one of the new people.
  122: Please find the spy soon.
  123: I wonder if Nicole will let us actually use this fighting technique.
  124: If Amber saw us now, she'd be furious.
  125: Neil was very happy that you were willing to teach us.
  126: Now I can take on all the Children by myself!
STOREROM:
  100: This room looks particularly ransacked.
GARRET:
  100: You see Garret.
  101: |-
    You shouldn't be here during the day. It makes Set unhappy. Come
     back at night
  102: Oh, OK.
  103: He should learn to deal with his problems.
  104: That's not important. What is important is that I speak with him.
  105: You should talk to Set.
  106: |-
    You receive: a shotgun, 10 shotgun shells, 4 flares,
     4 Coke bottles and $200.
  107: 'You receive: a shotgun, 10 shotgun shells and $100.'
  108: 'You receive: 4 flares, 4 Coke bottles and $50.'
  109: You had better leave now.
  110: See you around.
  111: Is this all I get? I deserve more, and you'd better give it to me!
  112: Yerg.
  113: You need to leave here . . . immediately.
  114: Follow me. I'll see to your reward.
  115: |-
    I hope not, for your sake. Set was not too happy to have
     to use you. It might be a good idea to leave Necropolis . . . soon
  116: I told you to leave.
  117: Whatever.
  118: Perhaps. Hmm. Here, take this as well.
  119: You receive $100.
  120: Now leave.
  121: |-
    Hmm. Some things are missing from the fridge. It seems that we have been
     robbed.
  200: Garret ignores you.
  201: Here is your reward.
  202: You receive a large reward.
  203: 'You receive: '
  204: a shotgun
  205: some shotgun shells
  206: some flares

    Although this tape is damaged beyond use, there is some writing

CITIZEN:
  100: You see a citizen of Shady Sands.
  101: Welcome to Shady Sands, stranger!
  102: Uh, thanks.
  103: What's the deal with this place?
  104: Hnnnh!
  105: We are a true community. We all work and share together.
  106: How do you survive out here?
  107: Who's your leader?
  108: |-
    We have farms and irrigation, and we herd Brahmin. Everybody
     contributes their skills to making something useful.
  109: |-
    Aradesh is our current elder. With his experience he helps to
     lead the community.
  110: Hi.
  111: Hello.
  112: How are you?
  113: Nice to see you.
  114: Good day.
SETH:
  100: You see Seth, leader of the guards of Shady Sands.
  101: |-
    You! You've plagued our village for long enough.
     I'll kill you myself!
  102: |-
    Nothing good comes of your kind. I will kill you and
     rid the wasteland of one more monster.
  103: |-
    Not very bright, eh? Well, watch out for the Radscorpions,
     and stay out of trouble.
  104: Scorpin!
  105: Bye-bye.
  106: |-
    You look like one of those raiders. We keep a close watch
     here in Shady Sands. What do you want?
  107: I want all of your money!
  108: I'd like some information.
  109: Bloop?
  110: Good day. I am called Seth. How can I help you?
  111: I'd like some information.
  112: Wub-wub!
  113: Information? What do you want to know about?
  114: What can I do for you?
  115: I want to know about the Radscorpions.
  116: I want to know about the raiders.
  117: I want to know about this place.
  118: Take me to the Radscorpion caves.
  119: Cave!
  120: Nothing else, thanks.
  121: What do you want now?
  122: |-
    Those damn Radscorpions have been after our Brahmin since we moved here.
     Not a week goes by that someone doesn't get poisoned trying to keep them out of the
     pens. Last week they took my brother Jarvis. Razlo, our doctor, is looking for an
     antidote as quickly as he can. Hey, if you have the means to help us, why don't
     you talk to our leader, Aradesh.
  123: |-
    There are several groups of raiders. I organize guards like Ian
     to help fight them off. There is one band to the southeast of here. Watch out for them.
  124: |-
    Shady Sands is a peaceful community. We have our own irrigation
     system, so we can grow our own food. If we were not plagued
     with raiders and Radscorpions, we would have no problems.
  125: Are you sure you want me to give you directions to the Radscorpion caves?  I
    can't go, but I can show you the way.
  126: Yes.
  127: No.
  128: Ok, just let me know when you are ready to go to the caves.
  129: "[Done]"
  130: Uh-huh.
  131: Uh-uh.
  200: |-
    Our entire town is grateful to you for destroying the
     radscorpions. Thank you.
  201: Thanks to you, we are now safe from them.
  202: |-
    Are you sure you want to return there? It is a long journey,
     and you have removed the threat of them.
  203: Ok. Enjoy your stay here.
  204: |-
    Welcome to Shady Sands, stranger. Please holster that weapon
     while you are here.
  205: Hello stranger. Welcome to Shady Sands.
  206: |-
    You should speak to Aradesh, our leader. He likes to meet
     all of our visitors. He should be in our Town Hall, the building
     to the south.
  300: |-
    Thank Dharma you're here wanderer. My girl . . . uh, Tandi,
     Aradesh's daughter, has been kidnapped. We believe the raiders have her.
  301: Where are these raiders?
  302: Wow. Tough break. Well, I'll see you later.
  303: I'm sorry, I wish I could help.
  304: |-
    That's terrible, but I've got to take care of those
     radscorpions first. They pose a danger to your whole town.
  305: Where's Tandi? Why haven't you rescued her?
  306: I need more supplies before I can tackle those guys.
  307: I decided the little tramp wasn't worth the risk.
  308: I'm working on it.
  309: I thought I'd take care of your radscorpion problem first.
  310: I thought you were a good person. So be it.
  311: They're to the southeast. Please, hurry. I don't know what they'll do to her.
  312: Okay, I'll get her back for you.
  313: I didn't say I'd help, I've got my own problems to worry about.
  314: How much is this job worth to you?
  315: I've got to help my own people. I'm sorry.
  316: |-
    I knew you were a heartless mercenary. We'll pay you well for saving her,
     rest assured.
  317: |-
    If you're not going to tell me how much you'll give me, I'm not going
     to take the job.
  318: Alright, I'll take care of it for you.
  319: Sorry, I've got to go.
  320: You bastard!
  321: Please hurry. Only the gods know what they are doing to her.
  322: |-
    I wish you'd save Tandi first, stranger, but, if you're willing to help us
     with the radscorpions, I guess I'll show you the way.
  323: Okay, take me to the radscorpions.
  324: I changed my mind. Good bye.
  325: Great. I'll be back in a while, and you can take me then.

  1101: |-
    He leads the Khans.  He is one of the most dangerous men that
     has ever set eyes on Shady Sands.  He leads the raider clans with a
     heavy fist.
  1102: |-
    It's 4-6 days to the southwest.  Good trading occasionally, but
     more often than not, they try to stiff us.
  1103: You're standing in it.
  1104: |-
    Much farther to the south than Junktown.  The Hub is the largest
     city I've heard about.  Must be a thousand people there, at least.
  1105: Sorry, I can't help you.
  1106: |-
    She is the daughter of Aradesh.  Some day she could lead us, but
     she must learn to temper her ways.

     find him at work in the communal hall.

CHOCTECH:
  100: You see a Children of the Cathedral technician.
  101: Drop your weapons and the Nightkin will let you live.
  102: Join us, don't fight us.
  103: You will become one with the Unity!
  104: Nightkin, take this fool prisoner. Our Master will be pleased.
  105: Please don't kill me. I only work here.
  106: You wouldn't kill an unarmed man, would you? Would you?!
  107: I surrender!
  108: You have no right to be here. What do you want?
  109: Hne.
  110: Who are you?
  111: You sick dogs! I tire of your life!
  112: What is this place?
  113: |-
    You are nearly a Nightkin now. I hope the dipping will not damage
     your intelligence further.
  114: |-
    I am part of the Unity. I am a glorious servant of our Master.
     I will be the one who sees you become part of the Unity.
  115: You will find out soon enough.
  116: |-
    This is the birthplace of the superior race! This is the womb from
     which the armies of god will strike from! From the flesh of the weak comes
     the next race of man. Those who survive the dip will become the soldiers of god,
     and with their hands we shall shape the Unity.
  117: You are mad! You are just plain crazy! Die!
  118: How does it work?
  119: |-
    You will be bound in the holy restraints. We will lower you into a
     vat of the blood of god, the holiest of holies. The FEV will shape and change
     you. You will be strong. You become a Nightkin if you are fortunate and
     worthy of the honor, else you will die the most painful death possible. Soon, I
     will be honored. I will become strong. Then I will fear no man.
  120: You've been around the Nightkin for far too long. Goodbye.
  121: Just why are you telling me this?
  122: Where did you get the FEV from?
  123: |-
    You will only leave here as part of the Unity, or a lost soul in Hell!
     [pause] Besides, I sit down here with a bunch of converts. It felt good to get
     this off my chest.
  124: Where did you get the FEV from?
  125: |-
    You killed the Right Hand of god. The Master will be most upset.
     Now, it has come time for us to join the holy flame!
  126: |-
    You killed the Master. The death of the Unity is your fault.
     You have caused the death of the human race. I hope you feel good about yourself.
  127: Hnnn.
  128: As a matter of fact, I do.
  129: You'll join him in a moment. Pray to whatever god took his place.
  130: I go to join him now, in the holy flames!

  103: Urgh?
  104: Your boss sent me down.
  105: Don't talk to me like that, cretin.
  106: To see how you're doing.
  107: Nothing. Goodbye.
  108: I know you . . . right?
  109: No.
  110: Yes.
  111: Never mind.
  112: Um . . . okay.
  113: What are you doing?
  114: Okay? Does that mean that you're almost done?
  115: You're a little slow, aren't you?
  116: Yes, yes, almost done.
  117: With what?
  118: It's about time.
  119: Great. I'll see you later.
  120: Body parts almost ready to go to Hub.
  121: For what?
  122: Of course. That's why I'm here.
  123: I don't think I want to hear about this.
  124: Iguana man Bob send you . . . he happy, lots of good meat . . .
  125: He's selling human body parts for people to eat?
  126: You sick little scab, I'm gonna cut you up and sell you as meat!
  127: Of course . . . I'll be back in a minute.
  128: For Bob to sell . . . to eat . . . why you ask what we use for?
  129: No reason. Goodbye.
  130: I wasn't sure this was where Bob got his human meat from.
  131: Sometimes I have a little trouble thinking.
  132: Me have trouble thinking, too . . . what we talk about?
  133: I don't remember. Goodbye.

  136: Dunna.
  137: I don't talk to you any more.
  138: Yes . . . Doc Morbid has best human bodies around. None better.
  139: |-
    Uh . . . I'll be back to pick up the . . . bodies . . . in a little
     while. Goodbye.
  140: I go back to work now.
  141: Don't be messing with the Doctor's stuff!
SSWELL:
  100: |-
    You see the water supply to Shady Sands. This is too little water
     to supply your vault.
  101: |-
    You have no reason to climb down the well, but perhaps the
     rope will be useful climbing down holes.
  102: You learn nothing more from the well.
  103: You make a wish as you hear the bottle cap splash into the water.
VREEDISK:

  107: What kind of "services" do you offer?
  108: Mom?
  110: |-
    That's very sweet of you, but no, I'm not.
     I'm sure you can find her somewhere else.
  112: I most certainly am.  Did you want something?
  113: Nicole sent me to talk to you.
  114: Uh . . . no. Never mind.
  116: Nicole? I'm so sorry. I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
  117: Well, she told me to tell you 'Red Rider'.
  118: Sure you do! She sent me!
  120: |-
    I'm sorry. I . . . I just don't know.
     Follow me to a place where we can talk.
  122: I'm terribly sorry for your inconvenience. I hope it doesn't upset you.
  124: |-
    Are you . . . certain? Uh . . . excuse my curiosity,
     but you seemed to be looking specifically for me.
  125: Well, Nicole sent me.
  126: Just heard about you and wanted to see what you looked like.
  128: |-
    I . . . I'm sorry, but that sort of attention
     makes me a little nervous. Don't know why,
     it's silly of me, I know. Well, enjoy your walk.
  130: |-
    Oh, I'm hardly an authority. You should see Morpheus,
     the High Priest. I'm sure he can help you much more than I.
  132: But I only meant . . . oh . . . I have to go now.
  134: Well, hello again! Are you just walking or may I help?
  136: Is there . . . something I can help you with?
  137: Are you Laura?
  138: Can I ask you a few questions about the Children?
  139: Nothing, thanks.
  140: Uh, Mom?
  142: |-
    No. We already talked about this. You'll have to go
     somewhere else my friend.
  144: |-
    Oh . . . I'm glad you found me. Nicole sent a list with the
     information I was supposed to find.
  145: So what did you get?
  147: |-
    Um.  There's so much I'm just . . . I'm not sure what
     you need or where to start. Is there
     something in particular you want to know about?
  148: Is there a secret entrance into the Inner Sanctum of the Church?
  149: What have you learned about The Master?
  150: What are the Children's plans?
  151: What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
  152: Nothing more, thanks.
  154: It's not the Inner Sanctum you want to enter.
  155: Then what?
  157: |-
    I followed Morpheus down a back secret staircase.
     The guy activates a secret door at the bottom.
  158: Then what?
  159: Can you show me this door?
  161: |-
    He uses this strange key to open it and
     disappears. I've never tried to follow him.
  162: Do you know where this key is?
  163: Why not?
  165: Well, I'd say he keeps it on him.
  166: Will you show me the door now?
  168: Well, of course.
  169: Great. Let's go.
  170: Can I ask you a few more questions first?
  172: Follow me.
  174: Okay, but we have to hurry.
  176: Oh, make it quick.
  178: |-
    Believe me, if you've seen the Nightkin,
     you'd know why. Unless you're stupid.
  179: Maybe I am, but I'm not scared.
  180: I can understand that. Can we get back to the questions?
  182: |-
    Oh, I see that's real funny. Lookit, I'm in the
     middle of this day in and day out.
     You have a problem with how I do this,
     you just keep it to yourself. Ya got it?
  183: What are you going to do, whine some more?
  184: If that's how you want it.
  185: You're right, I'm sorry. How about we get back to business?
  187: |-
    Uh, not much. The Children worship him, and sometimes
     a huge vision of him appears in the main nave of the church.
  188: So he's real?
  189: Sounds scary.
  191: |-
    Yes and no. I snuck up to the front one day
     and found a strange mechanical device with a lens under the altar.
  192: Probably a holo-projector of some kind.
  193: So?
  195: |-
    Huh . . . believe me, it was at first, but then I
     snuck up and looked at the alter when nobody was
     looking. And there's a device underneath with
     wires and a big lens.
  196: Probably a holo-projector of some kind.
  197: So?
  199: |-
    So I'm pretty sure this Master is flesh and blood.
     And I also think I know where he is.
  200: Where?
  202: |-
    Every once in a while, Morpheus will go through a
     secret staircase leading below the Church. And he
     enters a secret door with some kind of key. I think
     the Master is down there.
  203: Can you show me this staircase right now?
  204: Do you know where this key is?
  206: |-
    Now that's scary. Morpheus is preaching that the
     earth should be 'purged of the infidels,' and
     other crap like that. I think they're planning
     to take over everything!
  207: Can they do it?
  208: What's their first target?
  210: |-
    Now you know, it could be. I mean, they have
     enough members, and the different hospitals
     in the towns are stocked full of weapons and explosives.
  211: We must tell the Followers.
  212: What are you going to do?
  214: |-
    I was planning on it. In fact, after we're done,
     I'm heading over there.
  215: One quick question?
  216: I'll let you go then.
  218: Okay. Good luck!
  220: |-
    Well, I'm going to go warn Nicole.
     And hopefully, the Followers can send help to the other towns.
  221: I'd like to ask a few more questions first.
  222: Okay, I'll let you go then.
  224: Adytum, that town doesn't have a chance in hell.
  225: What about the Followers?
  226: Can I help Adytum?
  228: |-
    The Children don't think we're enough of a threat.
     We'll show 'em.
  229: Good. What do you plan to do?
  230: Can I help Adytum in any way?
  232: |-
    Yeah, you can help 'em by getting to the Master. 'Bite the
     head off the snake and it won't coil around you,' as my grandmother used
     to say. She was kind of a handful.
  233: How do I get to him?
  234: Sound it. I need some more answers before you go.
  235: I'm on my way.
  237: They plan to take over all the towns!
  238: Which ones?
  240: Adytum's already fallen. The Hub is next.
  241: What're the Followers doing during this?
  242: Damn. What can I do?
  244: |-
    We sent a group to help Adytum,
     and they were all wiped out. Nicole sent another
     one to the Hub. I just hope they get there in time.
  245: Damn. What can I do?
  247: |-
    They've already taken out the Hub and Adytum!
     I think the Followers are next, so we're preparing our defense.
  248: Why are you here then?
  249: What can I do?
  251: I'm here to keep an eye on the Children.
  252: What can I do?
  254: |-
    The Children are setting up hospitals all over the place.
     Hmpf. I think they're trying to get people to trust them.
  255: Is it working?
  256: Is there anyway to stop them?
  257: That's the stupidest thing I ever heard!
  259: |-
    Ah, it sure looks that way. I mean, people are flocking to their
     Church. Can't they see it's a fake?
  260: You sure it is?
  261: How can I stop them?
  263: |-
    For one thing, people seem to disappear a lot
     around here, while the number of Nightkin are slowly growing.
  264: Why?
  265: Doesn't look good. But I need more answers before I act.
  267: I don't know. That's what you're here to find out, right?
  269: Find the Master and stop him!
  270: What have you found out about this Master?
  271: I will.
  273: 'Huh, I sure as hell hope so. Now, any more questions? '
  275: |-
    Actually, it's a good way to manipulate people,
     and this Master is damn good at it.
  276: |-
    No, I meant that's the stupidest thing I've heard from you.
     You're paranoid, aren't you?
  277: Well, I'll stop him.
  278: How can I stop this?
  280: Excuse me?
  281: You heard me.
  282: Never mind.
  284: Okay then. Good luck!
  286: |-
    Uh heh . . . Waiting desperately for someone to
     use that pathetic line on me.
  288: So, what can I do for you now?
  290: Oh, what now?
  291: I need to ask you a few more questions.
  292: Nothing, thanks.
  294: What are you doing? Put that down!
  296: Hey! Get out of here!
  297: Or else what?
  298: Sorry, I'll go now.
  300: Stop that!
  302: What . . . what are you doing in here? You need to leave!
  303: No, you get out!
  304: Okay, I'll go.
  306: Uh . . . I'm not sure about that. Go talk to Nicole.
  308: I'm not sure about that. Go talk to a High Priest.
  309: Well, as I said . . .
  310: I said . . .
  311: Well, as I said before . . .
  312: As I said before . . .
  313: Well, I'm quite certain I told you this already, but . . .
  314: Okay! I already told you this . . .
  315: Ah, once more? Well, I said . . .
  316: Again? I already said this . . .
  317: Oh dear, this is most disturbing. I simply will not say it again.
  318: |-
    Are you . . . Okay! Okay! Are you deaf?
     Read my lips, I'm not gonna to say this again.
  319: I believe that's quite enough. I'll not say it again.
  320: Not listening, huh?  Too bad, I'm not gonna say it again.
  321: Oh, those are dreadful people. I'm not going to talk about them at all!
  322: |-
    Nicole probably told you about us.
     We're trying to knock some sense into those
     thick-skulled, gun-toting, violence-mongering nitwits
     . . . Oh, present company excepted, of course.
  323: Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
  324: She leads the Followers. Pretty strong-willed. I trust her.
  325: |-
    The others are all so nice! It's wonderful here.
     We belong, we do good work . . .
  326: |-
    Oh, they're like a . . . blight on the world. Most
     are a waste and a few are just plain evil.
  327: Adytum, isn't that a town west of here?
  328: |-
    Adytum's a bit west from here. And the people there
     . . . well, they're a little paranoid, so don't
     expect a hospitable welcome.
  329: Oh, he's wonderful. He leads us. You should talk to him!
  330: |-
    He preaches peace and enlightenment and all that crap,
     but he's scum. No two ways about it.
  331: |-
    Oh, I can't begin to describe him. Morpheus leads us.
     He can do justice to your question.
  332: |-
    Ah yes, the Master, he's the god these nuts worship. Personally, I
     don't think he's a god, just somebody into manipulating everyone.
  333: Nightkin? I don't know what you're talking about.
  334: |-
    They're the big, ugly enforcers of the Master
     and Morpheus.
  335: The what?
  336: What, you couldn't figure out that's the Master?
  337: |-
    It's the big place at the north end of the church,
     where Morpheus does all his ceremonies. I've been there,
     it's wonderful!
  338: |-
    It's at the north end of the church.
     I've watched Morpheus perform his little circus act there.
  339: Oh, you cannot go there. That's where Morpheus contemplates.
  340: |-
    That's where Morpheus and his cronies hang out.
     No one's allowed up there, though.
  341: They have proven themselves to the Church. The rest of us aspire to that.
  342: |-
    Oh yeah, these are the guys who've survived torture and who
     knows what else. Totally brainwashed and will do
     anything they're told.
  343: They are the high priests.
  344: Ah, those are the high priests. So far I think there's only 13, but I'm not
    really sure.
  345: That's not important.
  346: That's not important.
  347: I'm sorry. I simply don't have time for this.
  348: We don't have time to talk about that! Just keep to business.
  349: I'm not sure why you want to talk about that.
  350: Keep to the subject at hand, friend.

SSGUIDE:
  100: You see Katrina. She has a very pretty smile.
  101: I am unarmed, please put your weapon away.
  102: Hng!
  103: Why should I? This looks like a dangerous world.
  104: Why's that?
  105: Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
  106: I'll assume that means yes.
  107: |-
    Normally, I would agree with you.  It is very dangerous to travel
     unarmed.  But this is Shady Sands, and we are a peaceful people.  There is
     no need for weapons here.
  108: Ok.  Thanks.
  109: |-
    If you don't put your weapon away, I will not talk with you.  There
     are many people like me.  You should only use force if the situation calls
     for it.
  110: Hmm, ok.
  111: |-
    Welcome to Shady Sands, traveler.  My name is Katrina.  My job is to
     greet strangers and help them understand our village.  We find that
     there are fewer problems if you listen to what I have to say.
  112: Wubba!
  113: Tell me more about yourself.
  114: Please help me...
  115: I'm looking for a water-chip.  Seen one?
  116: I need help finding Tandi.
  117: I'm dealing with your radscorpion problem.  Any clues?
  118: Thanks, maybe later.
  119: |-
    It is a pity that you are dimwitted.  We will have difficultly
     understanding each other.  I hope the others in your Vault are not like you.
  120: Wubba-val?
  121: |-
    Yes, I can tell you are from a Vault.  You have that look about you.
     I came from Vault-15, to the east.  But I had to leave my home and now
     I live here.  Hopefully you will find what you are looking for, even
     if it is just another place to live.  I hope that your Vault did not
     kick you out due to your wits.  I do hope there is another reason.
  122: Hng.
  123: |-
    You will need to find another way to get your answers, as you cannot
     communicate well enough.  I hope that you do not hurt too many people
     in your journey.  Please be nice to the people here, we mean you no harm.
  124: Ahhh.
  125: |-
    I would be happy to help you.  I myself was once like you.  Hopefully,
     my knowledge will be useful.
  126: What should I do if I get hurt?
  127: Where can I get some better equipment?
  128: Tell me about this place.
  129: Tell me about the rest of the world.
  130: Tell me about yourself.
  131: That's all for now, thanks.
  132: |-
    Well, if you can't get to a doctor, you will need to heal yourself.  Stimpaks
     are a common healing item.  Use them on yourself to heal minor wounds.
     First Aid is a slower method, but it is always available.  For major
     wounds, like a broken leg, you will need to use Doctor skill.
  133: |-
    You will have to do like we do.  Scavenge it, or trade for it.  And if
     you are attacked, your foes might provide equipment, if you live long
     enough to loot them.  We are a peaceful community, so we mostly barter
     or trade for the items we cannot produce.
  134: Tell me more about bartering.
  135: |-
    You are standing in Shady Sands.  We are but a small town in a large
     world.  We just want to be left alone.  Besides some mutated animals
     and other creatures of the desert, only the Raiders give us trouble.
     Aradesh is our leader.  He is in the large central house, speak to him.
  136: |-
    I know very little of the outside world.  I escaped from a Vault when
     it was attacked.  Unfortunately, I was very hurt and do not remember
     much of what happened.  But Dharma was watching over me, and I was
     found by the people of Shady Sands.  I live here now.  Have you
     spoken with Ian, yet?  He is a merchant guard who was hurt.  He is
     recovering in the guardhouse over there. [She points to the east]
     He is more widely travelled than I.
  137: |-
    My life was very boring.  I was raised in a Vault.  I lived there for
     many years.  Unfortunately, we were crowded and life was very bad.
     There was a schism, and many people left, taking with them the best
     equipment.  Still, some of us tried to stay in the Vault.  But then we
     were attacked.  I was hurt, and I ended up here.  Now I try
     to help people . . .
  138: Where was this Vault of yours?
  139: |-
    Bartering is the exchange of goods. You give me some items,
     and I give you items in trade. Since you initiated the barter,
     I will let you pick and choose what you want. But the deal must be one that
     I think I will like, so you will probably want to give me more valuable
     goods that you don't need in exchange for less expensive things that you want.
     And if you don't have enough items to trade, there are always caps.
     Bottle caps are the only common money found out here. The caps are backed
     by the merchants of the Hub, so you can trade them anywhere.
  140: |-
    It was Vault-15.  It is due east of here.  We tried to make contact
     with some other Vaults, but we always failed.  I think it was the
     raiders who attacked my fellow dwellers.  Be careful!
  141: |-
    I hope you find her.  She is like a little sister to me.  I think it
     was one of the raider groups who took her.  Find out as much information
     about them as you can and equip yourself before you go after them. But don't
     be so quick to fight, even they will sometimes listen to reason...
  142: |-
    Seth has been trying to follow the radscorpions.  He claims that he
     even knows the way to their lair, but I think he is a little scared
     of going out there.  His brother was seriously injured by one of
     the mutants, and Seth doesn't quite know what to do.
  143: |-
    As a matter of fact, yes.  My old home, Vault-15, had one.  I
     haven't been there since I was hurt, but you might find what you
     are looking for there.  Someone said that they tried to go to the
     Vault to have a look around, but it was dark and the elevator was
     broken.  I hope you're better prepared.
  144: Hello again.  I hope you are doing well.  Is there anything I can help you
    with?
  145: Don't you ever go to sleep?
  146: |-
    Well, I take catnaps when you are not around.  Besides, I find the desert
     air very invigorating and healthy.  And I never tire of looking at the
     stars.  Can you imagine never seeing the night sky for your entire life?
     [She pauses and looks at you] Oh, I guess you can.
  147: Ah, yeah.  Thanks.
  148: Is there a doctor around here?
  149: |-
    Small places like Shady Sands would not be able to survive without the
     help of a healer.  Our doctor, Razlo, lives in southern most house.  If you
     are seriously hurt, see him.  Try not to bother him at night.  He's a pretty
     cranky person without his sleep.
  150: |-
    You gain 250 experience points for the knowledge you have gained from
     Katrina.

  102: I don't got nothing to say! Talk is for the weak!
  103: |-
    I don't know who you are, but I'll give you a fair warning: anyone who
     messes with the Khans, dies messy.
  104: You know, if you really thought you were stronger, you'd kill me.
  105: Too bad. I'm messing with you!
  106: Fine. Let's not mess with each other, and we'll be happy.
  107: I surrender. Please don't kill me!
  108: Hngrrr!
  109: Huh?
  110: Hail brother Khan! How goes the hunt? Have many weaklings died today?
  111: Hail sister Khan! How goes the hunt? Have many weaklings died today?
  112: I will save my boasts for the campfire, but I have many tales to tell!
  113: I have seen much blood and taken much plunder.
  114: Not bad. How about you?
  115: I've done better . . .
  116: |-
    You are an enemy of the Khans! You attack our warriors and take our women!
     Give me a reason why I shouldn't cut out your heart!
  117: Cut the bravado. Where's Tandi? Tell me, or you die!
  118: Can't think of anything. Let's fight!
  119: Because we'll both live if you don't try.
  120: I'm in no condition to fight. I surrender.
  121: Are you one of them? One of the mutants?
  122: What do you know about mutants?
  123: Yeah, I'm a mutant!
  124: Do I look like a mutant to you?
  125: No.
  126: |-
    Perhaps. If you wish to fight, I'll fight. If you wish to go in peace,
     you have my word as a Khan that I will not attack.
  127: Let's fight.
  128: Let's not fight.
  129: Word of a Khan? What a joke!
  130: |-
    You are too strong for me, and I am tired by many days in the wastes. I do
     not wish to die. Though it shames me, I surrender.
  131: |-
    I agree. I give my word that you may go in peace, provided that you do not
     provoke me. Do not trouble me again.
  132: |-
    I don't want anything that belongs to a coward, including your life! Get
     out of my sight!
  133: You stupid animal. I shall enjoy killing you.
  134: Uh, yes . . .
  135: I shall enjoy hearing them. Farewell, brother!
  136: I shall enjoy hearing them. Farewell, sister!
  137: Really? Then I must have it for my own!
  138: |-
    Yes, I have heard that fortune heavily favors you. It is for that reason
     alone that I do not challenge you for your spoils. Farewell, my brother! May we
     next meet side by side in battle.

    I am tired and weary from a journey many days longer than I expected. Rad

    They have destroyed Shady Sands. They kill anyone in their path. I never
     dreamt such ferocity existed. We are all doomed . . .
  144: Murdering dog!
  145: |-
    No, but it is hard to tell. I have heard that they cloak themselves in
     night, that they cloud men's minds, and take the form of beautiful women!
     We are all doomed!
  146: |-
    That is good. I long to avenge our dead, and even the dead of Shady Sands.
     Any mutant that crosses my path will die! Go forth, friend! Go forth and kill!
     Death to the mutants!
  147: You will die for those words!
JUNKIE:
  100: You see a junkie.
  101: Look at the colors!
  102: Ohhhhh wowwwwwww!  I'm eating my own face...
  103: Mother?
COOK:
  100: You see a busy cook preparing a meal.
  101: I'm too busy to talk right now. I've got to get this meal ready!
  102: Hmmm! That smells really good. I bet it tastes great!
  103: I'm too busy to talk right now. I've got to get this meal ready!
  104: |-
    Why, thank you. I'm sure you will enjoy it. Thanks for the compliment.
     I'm going to tell all my friends about you.
GLOWCAGE:
  100: |-
    It appears as though this cage contained lab animals for
     for testing. Somehow, the bars have been torn off.
ZARK:
  100: You see a thug.
  101: Hey, aren't you the bastard who's been screwing us over? Man, did you come
    to the wrong place!
  102: Hey aren't you the bitch who's been screwing us over? You're in the wrong place,
    lady, and it's gonna cost you!
  103: I'm on your side now. So get outta my way!
  104: You're mistaken. Everyone looks the same out in the Wastes.
  105: Wrong place? Looks right to me!
  106: You wanna start something, I'll make sure you go down before I try something.
    C'mon punk, start it up! Let's see some balls!
  107: Wrong place? I not lost!
  108: Yeah. What do you want?
  109: Man, I just want to speak with a real human being. These zombies are giving
    me the creeps.
  110: Brother, will you not praise the Master with me?
  111: Hey, just looking for a friendly face.
  112: I want to see the Master.
  113: To see a valley filled with my enemies' heads mounted on spears. A silent valley,
    except for the wind whistling through their ears.
  114: Food! Me want food!
  115: Hey, haven't I heard about you? You've killed all sorts of shit, haven't you?
    What brings you here?
  116: I heard about some strange stuff happening here. What's going on?
  117: Peace, unity, that sort of stuff.
  118: Where's the Master?
  119: Just looking for a friend. Someone to talk with.
  120: I heard the booze is pretty good around here.
  121: My feet.
  122: You wanna talk, you better get that weapon outta my face! Lower it now!
  123: It's a force of habit. You drop the attitude and I'll lower the weapon.
  124: I'm not dead yet, so I'm not lowering it.
  125: What's the problem? I just want to talk.
  126: I'm on guard duty.
  127: What you say?
  128: You got something to say, say it fast.
  129: What's going on around here?
  130: I want to speak with the Master.
  131: I want to speak with whoever's in charge here.
  132: It! It-it-it-it-it-it-it!
  133: |-
    A ton of shit. Peace. Unity. Love. Lots of idiots running
     around like zombies. Morpheus counting his bottlecaps
     upstairs. Lasher living up to his name. You want a piece
     of this, you're welcome to it?
  134: I've heard that you're doing a lot of stuff that isn't exactly peace and love.
  135: What's going on with Morpheus?
  136: Who's this Lasher character?
  137: Fine. What do you want?
  138: Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?
  139: What's going on around here?
  140: Where's the Master?
  141: Just looking for a friend.
  142: To finish what the nuke started.
  143: Man, stay away from him! He's completely.. I dunno if I can really describe
    him. Imagine the one person on Earth you don't wanna know. Lasher's worse.
  144: Does he and Morpheus get along?
  145: So what's he done? What makes him so bad?
  146: You ain't met me yet pal.
  147: Talk to Morpheus, and hope he doesn't kill you for asking.
  148: I don't think he'll want to do that. I have important information.
  149: Why would he want to do that?
  150: What's this about Morpheus?
  151: Well, this world is 'kill or be killed', and I'm still here!
  152: Yeah, what sort of information?
  153: There's a spy here. I need to see the person in charge at once.
  154: I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you.
  155: Uh.. well.. I can't talk about it.
  156: Somebody in the Cathedral's gonna die soon. Maybe lots of people.
  157: Fine. I don't really care who you are. Now get out of my face!
  158: Everybody! Take this asshole out now!
  159: Mister, you're nuts! Why don't you get outta here?
  160: Lady, you're nuts! Why don't you get outta here?
  161: Because I'm having such a good time. What's you're problem? I haven't disemboweled
    you - yet - where's your guts?
  162: Because I haven't killed you yet!
  163: Yeah, I really want your company. Like I enjoyed it last time! Get lost!
  164: Hi there. Nice weapon you got. Now try lowering it.
  165: It's a force of habit. You drop the attitude and I'll lower the weapon.
  166: I ain't dead yet, so I ain't lowering it.
  167: What's the problem? I just want to talk.
  168: I'm on guard duty.
  169: Thanks for the complement. Dork.
  170: What you say?
  171: Fine. What do you want?
  172: Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?
  173: What's going on around here?
  174: Where's the Master?
  175: Just looking for a friend.
  176: To see your head drop off your shoulders, so I can kick it around this room
    like a soccer ball until your skull has been completely smashed to pieces!
  177: If you weren't wearing those robes, I'd kill you. As it stands, I want to kill
    you. Get away from me. Now.
  178: You aren't Nightkin. Guards! We have a spy..
  179: Where the Hell did they dig you up? And why don't you just go back to where
    you came from? Get out of here!
  180: We're getting ready for war! We're going to save the world! So we can fill
    it with all of this Peace and Unity bullshit.
  181: War? Where's the first move?
  182: Bullshit? Tell me you're joking! It must be true! [wink]
  183: Bullshit? Tell me you're joking! It must be true! [straight faced]
  184: If it's bullshit, why are you here?
  185: Just as long as I get a chance to kill something.
  186: I don't know! The only person who's seen him is Morpheus, and he's up in his
    tower. Man, you're creeping me!
  187: I have that effect sometimes. You keep cooperating, and you'll have no reason
    to be afraid.
  188: Tell me more about Morpheus!
  189: Who else is important in this joint?
  190: You've been helpful. Thank you friend.
  191: You need to be more social. You know where they stash the booze?
  192: Too bad. I was hoping that you stiffs would have some balls.
  193: And I thought I was nuts! You'd better get outta here before someone kills
    you!
  194: Please don't kill me! I'll tell you what you want to know.
  195: What's going on around here?
  196: Where's the Master?
  197: Who's in charge here?
  198: Who the Hell wants to know anything? I just like to smell a person's fear before
    I kill them. Man, what a high!
  199: I hear we're moving North, or planning to move North soon. They don 't tell
    us much except all the usual bullshit. But what are we doing talking about this
    out in the open? You must be nuts!
  200: "[Laughs] Me, I'd rather screw someone rather than get screwed. But we shouldn't
    talk like this out in the open. The zombies don't like it."
  201: Ya know, there are a lot of other people around here who think like that. Go
    bother them.
  202: I ain't saying nothing to you, pal. Go to Hell.
  203: The guy dresses in black, he does his preacher act, then he goes upstairs and
    counts his scripts. Man, I wish I had it that easy! But I better stop talking
    about him behind his back, or the Nightkin might hear.
  204: What are you afraid of?
  205: I want to know more.
  206: Where's all the caps around here?
  207: What's he preaching about?
  208: Bring 'em on! I could use a little action!
  209: There's Lasher. Man, stay away from him! He's completely.. I dunno if I can
    really describe him. Imagine the one person on Earth you don't wanna know. Lasher's
    worse.
  210: Does he and Morpheus get along?
  211: What's his role in the scheme of things?
  212: So what's he done? What makes him so bad?
  213: Hey, you ain't met me yet, pal!
  214: In future, find somebody else to bug.
  215: Man, I wish we had some of that stuff! After hours of listening to 'Hail this'
    and 'Peace', 'Unity', and the Bullshitting Way, I wanna get drunk too!
  216: You got to be kidding. This place is a Church! There's gotta be booze!
  217: No booze? Shit!
  218: If I don't get enough booze, I start drinking blood.
  219: That's Morpheus. Our leader. He's up in the tower, I think.
  220: Leader? What's he leading you to?
  221: C'mon, man. That tells me nothing. Share some of the dirt!
  222: Who else is important in this joint?
  223: You've been helpful. Thank you friend.
  224: He got any booze on him? Is there any smooch in the joint?
  225: Hmm, a nice private place, nobody to bother me when I kill him.
  226: You gotta be joking. The Nightkin are killers. You look at them the wrong way,
    and they'll cut off your body parts, cook 'em, and feed them to you a piece at
    a time. They can't be killed. They're the Master's enforcers and they're gonna
    tear apart the world for him. And I ain't saying nothing else!
  227: There ain't nothing else to tell, and if you're smart, you don't wanna know!
  228: I dunno. I looked for them myself! I hear Morpheus got a stash, but the Nightkin
    guards the main one. I've known guys who went looking around for secret passages
    who were never seen again. I stopped looking after awhile, and if you're smart,
    you won't start! Ain't worth it!
  229: You gotta be joking. Talk to the zombies, man!
  230: Maybe you belong together after all!
  231: There ain't any booze man! Life's a bigger bitch than Lasher! Now why don't
    you go find someone else to talk to you, you little puke? Get outta here!
  232: Don't give me bullshit, pal. What do you really want?
  233: Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?
  234: What's going on around here?
  235: Where's the Master?
  236: Just looking for a friend.
  237: All I want is some booze. Maybe some rad scorpion juice?
  238: |-
    I want some boy with a punk attitude to piss me off enough
     that I'll remove his tongue, preserve it, and wear it on
     a necklace as a reminder of just how stupid people can
     be.
  239: The Master can kiss my ass. Just as long as I end up on the winning side, I
    don't give a shit. You got that, zombie!
  240: Finally! I've found a real human being in this place!
  241: My friend? Why is your life so filled with pain and suffering? Open your heart
    to the Master!
  242: How can you survive around here with that attitude?
  243: Yeah, you made it pretty clear.
  244: I give a shit. If someone called himself 'Master' and tried to kiss my ass,
    I'd kill him.
  245: Because I do my job good. I've killed three Apocalypse scum in the last month.
    Nobody gives me shit. You want to?
  246: I'm impressed. A guy like you must know the real story about what's going on
    around here..
  247: Apocalypse, eh? They're supposed to be tough?
  248: Three? That's all? You should see my bodycount!
  249: Nope.
  250: I'll bet yours didn't scream as loudly as mine did. I like it when they scream.
  251: Hey! A guy with a weapon's still a guy with a weapon! You think you can do
    better?
  252: No, my friend. I am devoted to peace, love, and unity.
  253: A guy with a weapon is dangerous. A guy or a woman with a weapon AND a brain
    is lethal.
  254: A guy with a weapon is dangerous. A guy with a weapon AND a brain is lethal.
  255: Yeah, I can do better.
  256: No way to tell. You wanna get it on and find out?
  257: Think? Who needs to think? I'll just show you what I can do. Die, asshole!
  258: I ain't heard anything about you, pal, so cut the bullshit and get out of my
    face.
  259: Thought so. Why don't you just go back to your zombie chants and leave the
    real work to guys like me.
  260: Yeah. I heard that about you. You may've killed your share of rad scorpions,
    but I'm badder! What's your angle? Why are you here?
  261: Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?
  262: What's going on around here?
  263: Where's the Master?
  264: Just looking for a friend.
  265: I heard the booze is pretty good around here.
  266: Wait a minute, aren't you that guy who.. oh shit, I'm outta here!
  267: Wait a minute, aren't you that woman who.. oh shit, I'm outta here!
  268: I ain't anybody's friend. I ain't that type. [long pause] I'd suggest you get
    out of my way, now.
  269: We try something here, and the Nightkin will tear us to pieces. Maybe we can
    meet outside later.
  270: Maybe. Or maybe we can both can the attitude and just talk about stuff. Like
    what's going on around here.
  271: Coward!
  272: Sure. Could be fun.
  273: Let's do it now.
  274: You asshole!
  275: Because people who get on his bad side don't stay alive very long!
  276: "[done]"
SHADDESK:
  100: You notice a desk cluttered with papers.
TREAD:
  100: You see a glowing ghoul.
  101: You tread without permission.
BRENDEN:
  100: You see a stern, young initiate with a book.
  101: You see Initiate Brenden.
  102: Good day. How may I be of assistance?
  103: I'm looking for Master Scribe Vree.
  104: I'm looking for General Maxson.
  105: I'm looking for Paladin Rhombus.
  106: What're you reading?
  107: Gaahh.
  108: Hmm. Apparently I may not be of assistance.
  109: Master Scribe Vree is on level three, in the computer lab.
  110: General Maxson is usually on level four, in the council chambers.
  111: Paladin Rhombus spends most of his time on level one, in the supply room.
  112: Is there anything else I can help you with?
  113: Thanks. Good day.
  114: |-
    Actually, it is a journal that I am keeping. I'm working on a treatise on
     the social dynamics of the Brotherhood.
  115: Hmm. Sounds interesting.
  116: So, what's the point?
  117: |-
    Indeed. I've been researching information about our predecessors from
     before the war and about the societies of the outside world. I think that the
     Brotherhood comes closest in organization to the Knights Templar of the so-called
     'Dark Ages'.
  118: Why did you decide to study this?
  119: The Knights Templar?
  120: |-
    Although the Brotherhood places a high emphasis on hard sciences and
     applications technology, there has been little in the way of research into the
     soft sciences, like psychology and sociology. For a well-rounded education, we
     must apply scientific thought to all endeavors.
  121: So what have you discovered?
  122: |-
    I've come to the conclusion that the Brotherhood functions mostly like a
     pseudo-religious organization. We have the strong military hierarchy, combined
     with codes of honor passed down from our ancestors. Combine this with our
     technical skills and I think that there are two paths of development for the
     Brotherhood: a techno-religious dictatorship or a benevolent research society.
  123: What could influence the development of the Brotherhood?
  124: |-
    Ultimately we have a command heirarchy, with the Elders at the top. The
     most influential positions, then, are the Elders and the High Elder. A charismatic
     High Elder could direct the Brotherhood almost completely. We need to be careful
     to make sure that we have a leader who is both strong and visionary. Thankfully,
     I think that General Maxson fits that description.
  125: |-
    According to my research, the Knights Templar were a military brotherhood
     which focused upon the acquisition of wealth and knowledge. Although they had
     some religious overtones in their structure, their quest for knowledge ultimately
     made them a secular organization. I think that they would have been a more
     theocratic organization if they had a greater interest in wealth and power, since
     the church of that era was primarily involved in control of gold and land.
  126: And how does this relate to the Brotherhood?
  127: |-
    We must understand our past if we are to recognize our directions for the
     future . . . but I'm sure you wouldn't understand that.
ADYTOWNR:
  100: You see an inhabitant of Adytown.
  101: Looks like rain . . . as always.
  102: Sorry, have to go. Got work to do.
  103: We don't get many outsiders here.
  104: Gotta get back to work.
  105: I'd get back to the Hub, if I were you.
  106: Good day . . . if that is what you can call it.
  107: Yeah . . . whatever.
  108: No time to talk.
  109: Can't talk right now.
  110: Hope the rain ain't glowin' like yesterday.
  111: Looks like we're going to be short food again.
  112: I hope the caravans pass by again soon.
  113: We have a chance to make it now.
  114: Adytum will be the town we want it to be.
  115: Thank you for your help.
  116: Thank you for getting rid of the Regulators.
  117: Thank you for our freedom.
  118: It is good that the Regulators are gone.
  119: Welcome to the New Adytum.
ARMOR:
  100: You see damaged Power Armor.
  101: You cannot use this until it is repaired.
  102: It seems to be missing a part that you can't find.
  103: It is obvious that you do not yet have the skill to repair this.
  104: You repair the armor.
  105: That does nothing.
  106: You fail to repair the armor.
  107: 'You gain '
  108: " experience points for repairing the power armor."
MORPH:
  100: You see Morpheus.
  101: |-
    I don't remember inviting anyone to my room?  And yet I have a
     visitor. Why?
  102: Oh, I'm sorry. I seem to be lost.
  103: Because I have such a deal for you...
  104: 'I''m '
  105: ". What's yours?"
  106: One of the Brothers sent me up here.
  107: Mom?
  108: No.  I'm Father Death...
  109: |-
    Well, my child, it's quite dangerous to explore
     places where you do not belong.  Where were you heading that you ended up in
     my private chambers?
  110: |-
    I'm new, and I was looking for the bathroom. One of
     the other High Priests sent me up here.
  111: |-
    I was looking for the confessional, and one of the
     High Priests sent me up here. I'm really sorry I
     ended up here!
  112: Well, I'm not really lost.
  113: I was heading up here to kill you.
  114: I forget. I'll just go.
  115: " Ahh...Heh, heh heh. That would be Lasher.  He so loves getting the worshipers\n
    in trouble.  This is your lucky day, my ignorant little friend.  You may leave\n
    now without incident. "
  116: " You were warned.  Guards! "
  117: " You are a pathetic liar.  Tell me the real reason you\n are here now...before
    I have you skinned alive. "
  118: No really! I'm lost!
  119: All right, you got me. I'm here to offer you a deal.
  120: I'm just looking around.
  121: " I suspect you\n are a spy, sent by the Followers.  I may be wrong, but I
    do not take chances.\n You must be eliminated. "
  122: " What could you possibly offer me? "
  123: I'm from a Vault. You know what that is, right?
  124: I'd like to offer you some information about your enemies.
  125: I was sent here by the Master. He wants me to spy on you.
  126: Go on.
  127: |-
    I'd like to give your master a bit of information
     about my Vault.
  128: I have some information for the Master about my Vault.
  129: Not so fast. I want to know what I can get for my information.
  130: " I do not have a master, you imbecile! "
  131: Then what do you call the Master? Doesn't he control you?
  132: It sure looks like the Master controls you.
  133: Hey. Watch it with the insults!!
  134: I seem to have hit a nerve.
  135: " No one\n controls me.  He and I are...partners. "
  136: Yeah, right.  You're a puppy on a short leash.
  137: |-
    It doesn't matter. I have information about a Vault he
     would want.
  138: |-
    He gives commands, right? And you follow them, no
     questions asked.
  139: " I do not tolerate\n insults. Guards! "
  140: " Fine. I will take you to the Master. But if\n you are lying, he will know. "
  141: Okay, fine.
  142: You're not taking me anywhere!
  143: |2-
     That is none of your concern.  But
     if you are truly from a Vault, the Master will find out.  Guards!  Come along.
  144: 'You may keep your life.  Now, tell me what you know. '
  145: |-
    I'm from a Vault, and I'm willing to give the
     Master the location.
  146: Or what?
  147: I won't tell you anything.
  148: " No? Then I will take the information from you.  Guards! "
  149: " And who might my enemies be? "
  150: Well, the Followers, for one.
  151: From where I stand, it looks like everyone.
  152: " Tell me what you know. "
  153: I don't think so. Take me to the Master. Him, I'll tell.
  154: Let's just say I know something to help you out against them.
  155: " Give me the information or die a slow...lingering...death. "
  156: Think the Master would be happy if you killed a Vault dweller?
  157: I'm only talking to the Master.
  158: " Ahh...So you are the Vault dweller I've been hearing about.\n Surprised?
    \ I have my sources. Now, I will take you as a gift to the Master.\n He'll be
    very pleased. "
  159: How about we take you out in a bag, instead?
  160: And so will I.
  161: " A spy? Very foolish of you.  It will be\n difficult to report to him when
    you are dead, won't it? "
  162: " You are\n a bad liar. Now, tell me what you want. "

  164: I'd like to offer you some information about your enemies.
  165: " How surprising.  Now\n tell me why you are here. "
  166: I'm from a Vault, and I'm willing to give the Master the location.
  167: I'd like to offer you some information about your enemies.
  168: You're not very intimidating.
  169: I won't tell you anything.
  170: " Oh, really?  And how do you plan to do\n that? With your stunning wit and
    sharp tongue? "
  171: No, with this . . .
  172: That would be too easy against you. I'll go the more challenging route.
  173: I think a bullet to the head will do.

    Hi. I'm new to the Children and was wondering if
     I could ask you a few questions.
  184: Never mind.
  185: Nuhhh?
  186: Of course, my child.
  187: Thanks . . .
  188: Never mind.
  189: What are the Children's plans?
  190: Changed my mind. No more questions.
  191: What you say if I told you I'm from a Vault?
  192: |2-
     Our plans?  We are the messengers of evolution, my child.
     We follow the Master in his endless quest to heal the land and the people.
  193: Really? Just what kind of evolution are you teaching?
  194: What kind of healing?
  195: " We know there is a higher level, a glorious place humanity\n should strive
    to reach.  Ours is the goal to find the life better, more\n fulfilling, than the
    present one, marred by hardship and strife. "
  196: You're kidding, right?
  197: And have you found this higher level ?
  198: "[Angry]Why you!...[Calmly]You are forgiven. Not everyone is\n capable of seeing
    the light. But, tell me my child, why did you join us? "
  199: I had to see if this was as much of a joke as I'd heard. Now I know.
  200: Sorry. I guess I was out of line.
  201: You know nothing.
  202: " Yes, you\n were, but you are forgiven.  Now, if there are no more questions,
    I have work\n to do. "
  203: Actually, there are some more.
  204: Nope, thanks.
  205: " Of course. Please.  Continue."
  206: " Yes, but you\n are...forgiven.  Go in peace, my child. "
  207: |2-
     No, but with faith and
     hope, we're certain to find it. But all this should be known to you, my
     child.
  208: I know, but just a few more questions, please.
  209: I know. Goodbye.
  210: " We cure the physical body to start.  You've certainly\n seen our hospitals.
    \ Then we offer hope and healing for the spirit. "
  211: Wow. I almost believed that. You're good!
  212: Where are these hospitals?
  213: " Our glorious effort has just reached Adytum and, of course, the\n Hub shines
    with our efforts there.  But, I have a feeling there's more you\n wish to ask. "
  214: " These are wondrous days.  Junktown now joins in\n Adytum and the Hub in our
    quest to save body and soul.  Is there more you wish\n to know, my child? "
  215: As a matter of fact . . .
  216: Nothing. I gotta go.
  217: " The Children's vision now stretches from Adytum, to the Hub, Junktown, and
    now\n gently caresses Shady Sands.  Why do you ask? "
  218: Just wondering. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  219: Nothing. I gotta go.
  220: " You are what? "
  221: You heard me. Take me to see the Master, now!
  222: " Uh, yes.\n Well.  Please follow me. "
  223: " Oh, my child, you make no sense\n whatsoever.  please, find one of our physicians
    and get help. "
  224: " My child, talk to\n Lasher.  He'll help you with that. "
  225: " I said... "
  226: |2-

     you deaf?  I said...

  105: I am here to kill you!
  106: Just curious as to what is going on around here.
  107: Really? And what might you be looking for?
  108: I think I have already found her.
  109: I am looking for a spy.
  110: Nothing really. Just looking around.
  111: Just information.
  112: Thank you, but I am already spoken for. I think it is time for you to leave.
  113: |-
    Yes, the spy. I have heard of that bothersome pest. I really wish we
     could catch him.
  114: I kept hearing that it was a female spy.
  115: Have you heard anything about this spy?
  116: You are the spy!
  117: Good luck to you. Sorry I bothered you.
  118: |-
    I bet it was the braggart Neil that said as much. I'll have to have
     a talk with him later.
  119: You think that Neil is the spy?
  120: Then who do you think the spy is?
  121: You sound a bit defensive. Any reason why?
  122: I am almost sure of it. I just need some proof.
  123: I will get you proof.
  124: He seems like a nice person. I don't know.
  125: Why do you think it is him?
  126: |-
    Thank you. You don't know how much this means to me. Once you get
     proof, kill him.
  127: |-
    What is there not to know? He has access to the Children. He works
     during the night when most are asleep. It has to be him.
  128: Ok, I will check into it.
  129: Forget it. I think you are trying to divert me!
  130: |-
    I am truly sorry that you think that way. I cannot have someone think
     I am a spy. I will remove you from service.
  131: |-
    He has access to the Children during the night. No one ever sees
     him on duty. It must be him.
  132: Ok, I will check into it.
  133: Forget it. I think you are trying to divert me!
  134: |-
    I am not certain as to who it is. I think it may either be a guard
     or a scholar. They keep sneaking into the Children's Cathedral at night.
  135: Any other leads that you can think of?
  136: But I've heard talk that only the scouts do raids on the Children
  137: Ok. Thank you for your help.
  138: Not really. Just that I think it is a male and probably a scholar or guard.
  139: Ok. Thank you for your help.
  140: |-
    True. We scouts do many raids on the Children, and to much loss lately.
     This spy costs us dearly.
  141: You seem really torn up about this. I will look for the spy and kill him.
  142: Could the spy be a scout?
  143: Thank you for your help.
  144: Why would one of us do that?
  145: If you kill off the scouts, then you stop the raids.
  146: I don't know. Why would you do that?
  147: Don't know. Just wondering.
  148: |-
    Sounds like a good thought. I've noticed Peter never gets attacked much
     in the raids. I think he may be the one.
  149: Ok, I will check into it.
  150: Forget it. I think you are trying to divert me!
  151: You think that it is me?
  152: I'm sorry. I'm just a bit jumpy.
  153: Yes! Now you will die!
  154: Then wonder somewhere else. I must get back to work.
  155: I think he thinks I am the spy. But I'm not.
  156: Maybe he is right.
  157: Why would he think that?
  158: |-
    Because I am the new scout. I've only been here for about a year
     and the trouble started about five months ago.
  159: I think Neil may be right.
  160: I think Neil might be the spy. I'll go check into it.
  161: Then look elsewhere. This is no place for you.
  162: If you need information, look to Nicole. She thinks she knows everything.
  163: I can be persuaded to tell you something that's going on. For a price.
  164: How much?
  165: You would sell secrets?
  166: Forget it. I have no money.
  167: Three hundred caps and the information is yours.
  168: Sure.
  169: No way.
  170: There will be a raid on the south end of the Children's stronghold. Now go.
  171: Trying to cheat me? I'll show you!
  172: I'm sorry you feel that way. But, good day to you.
  173: I need to get by somehow. Now, do you want in or not?
  174: Sure.
  175: No way.
  176: Nothing. Now leave.
  177: Leave me. I am trying to get some rest.

  110: |-
    sold to the Hub, who sold them to the gangs. I guess you
     found a good solution.

    always wanted\n to go adventuring, but I think that I like . . . well, the "

    feeling of security here now. No more worrying about the

     living in a Vault?
  114: It's pretty boring, actually.

  116: Oh. Well, you must have had some adventures after leaving, right?
  117: Not really.
  118: Yes, there's quite a bit of danger out there.
  119: |-
    As someone once wrote, 'Adventure is someone else far
     away having a very unpleasant time.'
  120: Huh. The Hub merchants talk about radscorpions and stuff.
  121: Actually, it's mostly just desert.
  122: Well, actually, there are all sorts of monsters out there.
  123: Really? What kinds of monsters have you fought?
  124: Not much, just some rats and stuff.
  125: |-
    Yeah, the Hub guards said that there are lots of radioactive
     mutant things living in the desert. Monster hunting must be
     a real blast!
  126: Yes, it's a real kick!
  127: No; it's more of a pain. Venom, bites, radiation . . . it's deadly.
  128: I wish that I could go adventuring sometime.
  129: |-
    I never though about that. I rather like having
     clean water and a place to stay.

    Well, Father Morpheus hasn't given any sermons in such a long time. It's
     a pity, because I so love his speeches and everybody seems to be very
     busy with some Crusade.
  130: Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.
  131: |-
    Why I could, but the ones who go through the Servitor process are
     so much better than I am . . . Their minds are so much more focused on the
     Master than mine. Maybe after I get changed, I'll get better.
  132: Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.
  133: |-
    Why, that's Father Morpheus. He's such a good speaker, he really
     makes Peace and Unity come to life, and when he talks, I can just see those
     Holy Flames!
  134: That Father Morpheus, he sure can talk; and he's handsome, too!
  135: |-
    I think that's one of the Inner Mysteries that the priests discuss
     upstairs in the Inner Sanctum. I have not been privileged enough for that
     revelation yet, but I'm working at it!
  136: Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.

    My goodness! Alcohol and chems here! You must be mistaken. The Master
     would never tolerate it. He wants all of his followers to keep their minds
     healthy and pure.

  139: I think holy ammunition is available in the Cathedral Gift Shoppe . . .

  141: Why no. No help at all. Goodbye.
  142: |-
    Hello, brother. No, I've been meditating like a good initiate, waiting
     to be christened by the Servitors. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

    The Master is my friend. Unity is prosperity. Peace is prosperity.
     Peace and Unity come through Obedience. Obedience is proven through
     Submission to Authority . . .
  145: |-
    He who submits will be christened by the Holy Flame, but the faithful
     will not be burned. He who goes through Fire without burning shall have
     life everlasting . . .
  146: I hope I didn't miss anything . . .
  147: Is this a trick question? It's the Master, right?
  148: |-
    Well I've heard that the Master can be found in Holy Fire, that he
     waits below for Unity and Peace, and he lives in the hearts and minds
     of all virtuous people . . .
  149: I'm not sure which of these is a metaphor. Maybe he's everywhere.
  150: |-
    Why brother, nothing so impure profanes the Cathedral. I would let
     the high priests know if such sins were being committed.

  153: Oh no, brother, I do not require assistance. Please excuse me.
  154: Oh no, sister, I do not require assistance. Please excuse me.
  155: |-
    Well, I am told that the Peace and Unity we seek for all creatures
     is unusual, but I hope this will not be the case for much longer.

    Regulators.  They're trying to hold this place together in light of all the gang
    wars. They're understandably suspicious of strangers, so if you haven't spoken
    to them yet I suggest you do before you start wandering around.

    As a raider, I get to travel to many parts of the wasteland. In my

  109: What places have you been to?
  110: |-
    Well, it's nice that you think that you are so important that you don't need a
     name to go around here. But, I will at least tell you a little about us. We
     are the toughest people in the wastelands. No one can stand against us. Not
     even those wimps from Shady Sands or Junktown.
  111: What about Shady Sands?
  112: What is Junktown?
  113: I am sorry, but I don't have time to waste on those who are slow. Good bye.
  114: |-
    We never steal. We just take the extra that others have and redistribute it
     among our hungry people.
  115: So, basically, you steal it.
  116: That sounds like a really great idea.
  117: |-
    I've been to many places in the wastelands. The closest places that I've
     been to are Shady Sands and Junktown. Not much happens in those places, but
     they are always full of information and supplies.

    I mean, my boss didn't even send some of his goons to help.
     You'd think for all the cash I make for that loser, he
     would at least live up to his part of the bargain.
  125: Who's your boss?
  126: What bargain?
  127: |-
    Gizmo, of course. He runs all the sin in this town.
     Killian sure as hell wouldn't put up with me or my kind.
     If it wasn't for the fact that I make Giz a whole hell of
     a lot of money, I'd have to do other things to him.
  128: |-
    And, honey, those thoughts just don't do my stomach a whole
     lot of good.
  129: What else does Gizmo control?
  130: You should just hang it up and move on with your life.
  131: |-
    You're telling me. But what else can I do? It seems like
     my life has been designed by someone else. Oh, well. A
     girl has to make a living.
  132: But sugar, this one's for free.
  133: Thanks again, honey. We women gotta stick together.
  134: |-
    Just about every bad thing a person could do in this town.
     He owns the Casino. He runs me and some of the other
     gals, even some little kids. I hear he is trying to take
     over the bar.
  135: |-
    You stay away from him, okay? Take it from me, he is not
     the kind of patron he wants to make you think he is.
     Stay away.
  136: Giz wants to take care of Killian, if you get my meaning.
  137: |-
    Why, honey, I take care of men, and they take care of me in
     return. Gizmo gets 25% and I supposedly get his protection.
     You saw how well that went, huh?"
  138: What else does Gizmo control?
  139: You feel like paying another visit to Sinthia.
  140: Maybe Sinthia would like some company . . .
  141: |-
    You shit! You killed him! Why did you have to kill him?
     You bastard! I can't believe you killed him. All he wanted was someone to
     talk to. You don't care about human life, do you?
  142: |-
    You shit! You killed him! Why did you have to kill him?
     You bitch! I can't believe you killed him. All he wanted was someone to
     talk to. You don't care about human life, do you?
  143: Just get the hell out of my room!
  144: |-
    You killed him! I can't believe you killed him. All he
     wanted was someone to talk to . . .
  145: |-
    He ain't dead. He's just gonna have a hurt head when he
     wakes up.
  146: Hnnn.
  147: Yeah, whatever. Get the hell out of my room!
  148: |-
    Oh, sorry. I though he was dead. I though you killed him.
     He's not such a bad guy, after all. Just a little lonely.
  149: No problem.
  150: You again. What can I help you with this time?
  151: Just stopping by to see how you are doing.
  152: I've got $40, if you got ten minutes.
  153: I need some more info on your boss.
  154: |-
    Ah, honey, I don't think so. Imagine how the children
     would turn out.
  155: Doing fine, thanks to you, sugar.
  156: |-
    What do you want to know, but make it short, honey, I'm on
     the clock.
  157: How many guards does he have?
  158: Where does he stash the money?
  159: Does he have any weaknesses?
  160: Thanks, doll, but I don't need to know anything else.
  161: |-
    Hmm. I know about eight, personally, if you get my meaning.
     I think he has another ten or so.
  162: |-
    Money? How would I know? He only takes my money, he doesn't
     show me his. I would guess that it's in his bedroom,
     but for all I know, he could keep it where the sun doesn't
     shine. And for Giz, that's a big place.
  163: |-
    Only that he thinks he doesn't have any. Well, that and
     he's a fat slob, who can't move for a damn. He's got to
     have his guards help him move around. Even then, they gotta
     use a little tricycle. Heh heh.
  164: Sugar, you got a date.
  165: Sure, honey, for you.
  166: I'll show you a good time.
  167: |-
    Honey, you need some more money. I like you and all,
     but a girl has to make a living.
  168: |-
    I reserve the right to refuse admittance, and honey,
     you ain't getting nowhere near me!
  169: Sinthia is asleep.
  170: Sinthia is busy.
  171: Sinthia refuses to speak with you.
  172: Sorry, honey, I don't do freaks.
  173: Take your cash, your attitude, and your small prick somewhere else!
  174: Oh, gawd, somebody help me!
  175: 'You gain '
  176: " experience for successfully rescuing Sinthia."
  177: The guards remove the raider while he is unconscious.
SCRIBEA:
  100: Scribe
  101: |-
    Research is one of my favorite things to do. I feel like I'm
     trying to solve a mystery.
  102: |-
    Being a scribe is the best. You get to study all the old
     technologies and try to develop new ones.
  103: |-
    These terminals could use an enhancement.
     Maybe we should put the display over here.
  104: |-
    Sorry, I'm right in the middle of a possible breakthrough.
     I can't talk right now.
  105: |-
    Hey Initiate. You should train to be a Scribe, if you haven't
     decided yet.
  106: |-
    Us Scribes design all the equipment, weapons, and supplies.
     It's quite exciting.
  107: Please don't disturb me. I'm trying to finish my research.
  108: That's Vree right there. She's also a scribe.
KILLIAN:
  100: You see Killian.
  101: Who are you?
  102: How about telling me a bit about this town?
  103: Do you own this store?
  104: I want to buy something.
  105: What's there to do around here?
  106: What do I have to do to help you get rid of Gizmo?
  107: I'd better go.
  108: Nu-uhh?
  109: You want to buy something, friend?
  110: Uh-huh.
  111: Nuh-uh.
  112: Welcome to Junktown, stranger. What can I help you with?
  113: Hello, darlin'. What can I get ya?
  114: What do you want?
  115: Can I help you?
  116: How about telling me a bit about this town?
  117: Do you own this store?
  118: I want to buy something.
  119: What's there to do around here?
  120: What do I have to do to help you get rid of Gizmo?
  121: I'd better go.
  122: Nu-uhh?
  123: |-
    The name's Killian. Killian Darkwater. I'm the mayor of this fine
     town. And who might you be?
  124: 'I''m '
  125: "."
  126: 'My name is '
  127: ". I come from up north."
  128: What's it to you?
  129: Not much up that way 'cept desert and Shady Sands. You from there?
  130: No. I come from a Vault, to the west.
  131: No. My . . . um . . . village is a little west, in the mountains.
  132: Not really. Is there anything else up there?
  133: Of course, I come from there, you idiot.
  134: Hey, you sound like you're hopin' I'll fill in some gaps for you.
  135: Yeah, if you say so. So what do you need?
  136: Oh yeah, sure you do. And when you were a baby, your crib was a safe.
  137: |-
    No, no. It's called a Vault. It protected us
     from the war. It's been full of people for 80 years!
  138: |-
    Heh, you got my joke. I actually come from a
     village not far from Shady Sands.
  139: |-
    Don't feel bad, ain't the worst story I've
     been told. So . . . what can I do for ya?
  140: |-
    Well, travelers tell me there's a bunch of crazies up north called the
     Vipers. Another group of yahoos out east called the Khans. Neither
     one of them likely to invite you to supper as anything but the main course,
     if you know what I mean.
  141: What else is outside Junktown?
  142: Thanks.
  143: |-
    Well, ya got the Hub southwest. Don't go south, though. That'd be Necropolis;
     the, uh . . . climate's bad there, rain or shine. If you understand what I'm
     saying.
  144: Well, thanks for the information. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  145: You just know everything, don't you?
  146: I'd better be going now.
  147: Hell, why not. Ask away, friend.
  148: Yeah, okay. But make it quick, I got work to do.
  149: |-
    Well, Junktown's not much, but it's home. Mostly we trade with
     people or let 'em forget their troubles for a bit.
     Of course, we have our share of problems.
  150: Problems?
  151: What's there to do in this town?
  152: What other cities are around here?
  153: Thanks.
  154: |-
    From outside, we've had the occasional to-do with the Khans. But
     they've been pretty quiet lately. Inside, trouble's been from the Skulz.
     And I hear of some strange things happening down by the Hub, but
     they haven't affected us yet, knock on my mother-in-law's head.
  155: |-
    Oh, we got tons to do. The Skum Pitt's on the east side, by the
     entrance. Great drinkin' place. Gizmo's is near there. And if you're hurtin', Doc
     Morbid's your man.
  156: Thanks.
  157: That's all there is to do around here?
  158: |-
    Well, if we're too fast for ya, just pass on by, pal. It is pal,
     ain't it?
  159: Better than nothing, I guess.
  160: Then there won't be anything exciting in town.
  161: By a damn sight.
  162: |-
    Oh, you obviously have me confused with someone who has to take
     your lip. Why don't you come back when your mama teaches you some manners.
  163: |-
    Well that's a damn fine coincidence! That's what this store's here
     for! We got about everything you can need. Let me show you some
     things over here . . .
  164: |-
    You bet. May not be as big as some in the Hub, but people usually
     find what they're looking for. Take a look around . . .
  165: |-
    You have to wear a recorder and tape Gizmo confessing, or plant
     this wire tap in his office. Either way, and we got him.
  166: Well, howdy! What can I do for you today?
  167: You again. What do you want now?
  168: Unless you're gonna pay for that, you'd better put it down.
  169: You're not too bright, are ya. Boys . . .
  170: It's obvious your mama didn't teach you manners. Am I gonna have to?
  171: |-
    Well, congratulations. You just earned yourself a
     night in a cell. Boys . . .
  172: Now what the Uncle Sam-hell do you think you're doing here?
  173: Uh . . . I got lost?
  174: Oh, this is your place?
  175: Well . . . I broke in.
  176: |-
    You're damn straight this is my place! Now get the hell out before
     I make your head a wall decoration!
  177: Okay, okay, I'm going.
  178: You? Wake up, pal, you're still dreaming.
  179: Uh, no. You got stupid. Get out of here!
  180: Okay. Sorry about the inconvenience.
  181: Who's going to make me? You? Don't make me laugh . . .
  182: |-
    An honest thief. Hmpf. Well, I'm still gonna have to take you in.
     Come along quietly and you won't get hurt.
  183: All right, I'll come along quietly.
  184: Right . . . I don't think so.
  185: Like I said . . .
  186: I already told you . . .
  187: I already told you . . .
  188: Are you hearing okay? I said . . .
  189: Look, if you don't remember, that's tough.
  190: Listen, I've already told you that numerous times.
  191: You leaving so soon? Better pay first.
  192: This is not something I take as a joke. Now. Pay up.
  193: |-
    All right. Fine. Let's see if a night in the locker will
     cool you off a bit.
  194: Any more questions?
  195: You bet.
  196: Nope. That's it, thanks.
  197: See ya 'round town then. Be careful not to get into too much trouble.
  198: |-
    Listen. Thanks for saving my life. It's a mighty brave thing to do.
     Looks like we got ourselves a situation here. I know Gizmo's behind this,
     but I need proof.  You interested in helpin'?
  199: Me? What do you need me for?
  200: Can't you get someone else? I'm kinda busy . . .
  201: I'm in.
  202: |-
    Now, if I get proof, the people of Junktown will kick him out.
     Way I figure it, you need to either plant a bug at his place or wear a wire
     and get him to confess to you. Can you handle that?
  203: Whoa. Sounds kinda dangerous . . .
  204: What do I get in return?
  205: |-
    Ummm . . . no. Getting involved in other people's
     problems never works out.
  206: |-
    I'm not gonna lie to you, it will be dangerous. But I'll owe you
     one, and Killian Darkwater always pays his debts.
  207: You sure you can't find someone else?
  208: What do you mean, 'pays his debts.'
  209: I don't think so. Sounds too dangerous to me.
  210: |-
    It'll work best if it's you. Gizmo doesn't know you, so he might trust
     you. Or, at least he'll have a hard time blaming me. Either way, you're the best
     person for the job.
  211: Fair enough, I'll do it.
  212: Pass. Getting killed doesn't seem like a fun thing for me.
  213: What do I get out of this?
  214: |-
    I'll tell you what. Anything in the store, even the most expensive,
     it's yours. No charge. If it's a gun, I'll give you all the ammo you can carry.
     Does that sound fair?
  215: Yeah. I'll do it.
  216: Not even close. I'm not risking my neck for that.
  217: |-
    Well, damn. That's too bad. But, you know, I'm gonna have to lock
     you up until this thing's done. Can't risk Gizmo finding out. Sorry.
  218: |-
    All right, I owe you. Here's the bug and the wire tap.
     You let me know when it's done. And good luck.
  219: So, did you get the evidence?
  220: Not yet. But I will, believe me!
  221: I sure did.
  222: |-
    Well, he's not going to come here and confess! You shouldn't even be
     seen with me until this is done. Now go.
  223: Which, bug or tape?
  224: The bug.
  225: The confession.
  226: Great! Let me make sure it's working.
  227: |-
    Loud and clear. We're going to get him. In the mean time, we've
     got some business . . .
  228: Let's hear it.
  229: |-
    That's the first time I've been happy to hear his voice. Thanks,
     friend.  Now, time for you and me to take care of the other business.
  230: |-
    Well, thanks again. Oh, listen, I'm gonna take the guards and run
     Gizmo and his cronies out of town. I could use another gun. You up for it?
     Might be good for a laugh.
  231: Sure. It'll be worth it just to see him try to walk more than ten feet.
  232: Kinda depends on what you're willing to give me.
  233: Again? I don't think so. I've got way too much stuff going on.
  234: |-
    Go to Lars at the guard station. He'll fill you in.
     And listen, this town owes you . . . a lot.
  235: |-
    Well, I can pay you the standard rate for mercenary work,
     500 caps.
  236: Done.
  237: Sorry, not enough.
  238: Good enough. Go see Lars, he'll give you the details.
  239: |-
    Listen, that's all I'm offering. Thanks for getting the
     evidence, but I'm not going to beg for your services.
  240: All right, I'll do it for that fee.
  241: Oh, well. See ya around.
  242: |-
    Good luck in your travels. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a fat ass
     to move.
  243: |-
    Gizmo owns the casino. Named it after himself.
     Be very careful around him.
  244: Well, that's me. Where have you been?
  245: |-
    Oh, Lars heads up the guards here. He's a good guy.
     Pretty trustworthy.
  246: |-
    Well Vinnie, he's one of the problem children. He leads a group
     of punks called the Skulz. Still, they pay rent, and they haven't bothered
     anyone too much.
  247: |-
    Well, Doc owns a little place in the middle of the town. Does
     a nice patch job if you need it. Fairly reasonable prices.
  248: |-
    The Skulz are a bunch of punks who work for Gizmo. They don't cause
     that much trouble, but me and Lars keep an eye on them.
  249: |-
    Well, the Khans are a bunch of bullies who live outside to the
     east. They've been trying to take over Junktown for as long as I can
     remember, but they never make it past the gates.
  250: |-
    The Vipers are a crazy bunch from up north. They worship snakes, or
     something.
  251: That's my store. You need it, I got it.
  252: |-
    Great place to get a cheap room. Not too dirty, either. But don't
     mess with the owner, Marcelles, she'll pull your arms out if you smart
     off to her.
  253: |-
    Ah, Gizmo's is the casino by the entrance. I'm surprised you didn't notice
     it on your way in. You can usually smell the place for miles. But
     hey, it brings in the tourists.
  254: |-
    That's our resident bar. The food's okay, but the beer's great.
     The owner, Neil, takes no lip, not even from some of the Raiders that come in.
  255: |-
    Not much to say. Doc Morbid's pretty pissed 'cause their prices are
     lower for medical stuff. They're on the west side.
  256: |-
    The Death Claw? Oh, that's a bedtime story. Drinks blood and howls
     at the full moon. Yeah, right.
  257: |-
    Well, the Hub's the main place for trade. Anything you don't find
     here you'll probably find in the Hub. Not sure how safe it is nowadays, with
     all those strange things going on.
  258: |-
    Shady Sands? That's a little place up to the north. I'd like to do
     more trading with them.
  259: |-
    That city's death. I sent two patrols
     down there and neither one of them returned.
  260: |-
    Well, there are two kinds, the Khans and the Vipers.
     We usually don't get trouble from the Vipers, and a few of them
     actually pass through town. The Khans, though, they're a mean bunch.
     They think they can conquer the world, or some such crap.
  261: |-
    Where've you been for the last 100 years? In a closet? My father used
     to tell me stories about the War. His father was a soldier before starting
     Junktown.
  262: |-
    Well, there're some rumors coming up from the Hub. Caravans
     disappearing, people being butchered, even some talk of big green monsters
     who eat human flesh. All sorts of weird stuff.
  263: Nope, I've never heard of anything like that.
  264: No clue.
  265: Ohhh . . . I really couldn't tell ya.
  266: Go talk to Lars. He'll tell you more.
  267: "[Done]"
  268: "[More]"
  269: |-
    You gain 600 experience points for your part in the defeat of Killian.
     Junktown will never be the same.
  270: You gain 500 experience points for securing Gizmo's confession.
  271: I'm here to take you in, Gizmo. This time, I've got the proof I need.
  272: What do you know about this Gizmo character?
  273: Okay.
  274: Yeah, he's dangerous. I'm here to kill you for him.
  275: |-
    I'll say . . . that fat slob just tried to hire me to kill you.
     Why don't you do something about him?
  276: I'll take a shotgun and shells.
  277: I'll take a suit of leather armor.
  278: I'll take a doctor's medical kit.
  279: I'll take all the stimpaks you can spare.
  280: No thanks. Knowing that Gizmo's going to get his due is thanks enough.
  281: I'd like to take a look at traveling gear.
  282: I'll look around on my own, thanks.
  283: Never mind. Thanks.
  284: |-
    You moved against Gizmo without evidence. Y'know, he wasn't on the up-and-up,
     but neither are you. Go see Lars.
  980: Nope, I've never heard of anything like that.
  981: No clue.
  982: Ohhh . . . I really couldn't tell ya.
  983: Go talk to Lars. He'll tell you more.

     remember, but they never make it past the gates.
  1107: |-
    The Vipers are a crazy bunch from up north. They worship snakes, or
     something.
  1108: That's my store. You need it, I got it.
  1109: |-
    Great place to get a cheap room. Not too dirty, either. But don't
     mess with the owner, Marcelles, she'll pull your arms out if you smart
     off to her.
  1110: |-
    Ah, Gizmo's is the casino by the entrance. I'm surprised you didn't notice
     it on your way in. You can usually smell the place for miles. But
     hey, it brings in the tourists.
  1111: |-
    That's our resident bar. The food's okay, but the beer's great.
     The owner, Neal, takes no lip, not even from some of the Raiders that come in.
  1112: |-
    Not much to say. Doc Morbid's pretty pissed 'cause their prices are
     lower for medical stuff. They're on the west side.
  1113: |-
    The Death Claw? Oh, that's a bedtime story. Drinks blood and howls
     at the full moon. Yeah, right.
  1114: |-
    Well, the Hub's the main place for trade. Anything you don't find
     here you'll probably find in the Hub. Not sure how safe it is nowadays, with
     all those strange things going on.
  1115: |-
    Shady Sands? That's a little place up to the north. I'd like to do
     more trading with them.
  1116: |-
    That city's death. I sent two patrols
     down there and neither one of them returned.
  1117: |-
    Well, there are two kinds, the Khans and the Vipers.
     We usually don't get trouble from the Vipers, and a few of them
     actually pass through town. The Khans, though, they're a mean bunch.
     They think they can conquer the world, or some such crap.
  1118: |-
    Where've you been for the last 100 years? In a closet? My father used
     to tell me stories about the War. His father was a soldier before starting
     Junktown.
  1119: |-
    Well, there're some rumors coming up from the Hub. Caravans
     disappearing, people being butchered, even some talk of big green monsters
     who eat human flesh. All sorts of weird stuff.
  1120: Well, that's me. Where have you been?
  1121: |-
    Well, Doc owns a little place in the middle of town. Does
     a nice patch job if you need it. Fairly reasonable prices.
  1122: That's my store. You need it, I got it.
  1123: |-
    Ah, Gizmo's is the casino by the entrance. I'm surprised you didn't notice
     it on your way in. You can usually smell the place for miles. But
     hey, it brings in the tourists.

FARMPART:
  100: |-
    Hydropressurization pump, electro-fibrous coil wire, magnetic vacuum
     seal, power strip, three-pin to three-pin adapters . . . quite a collection of
     parts.
  101: These parts could probably be used by Miles to fix the hydroponics farms.

  103: ". Have you found the water chip yet?"
  104: Not yet. I haven't had much luck.
  105: No luck yet, but I know I'll find it. By the way, how are you doing?
  106: Urug!
  107: |-
    Oh . . . you don't understand me. I guess we really don't have much hope
     after all. Excuse me while I cry.
  108: Ugg!
  109: Please find it before we die of thirst.
  110: You've got to find it! Don't let us die like this!
  111: |-
    Keep trying. I believe in you. I know you will do everything you can
     to save us.
  112: Who do you think might be involved?
  113: |-
    I am afraid of what is happening. Someone has been stealing water and now
     everyone is on edge.
  114: Who would do such a thing?
  115: What happened?
  116: |-
    Some people have been accused and fights have broken out over it, but
     nobody really knows.
  117: Okay. Thanks.
  118: |-
    Some people reported that their water had been stolen. They weren't given
     more water but some friends shared with them. After this everybody got very
     paranoid and started guarding their water. A few days later someone knocked the
     guard out in the ration supply area and stole water.
  119: That's terrible! What can I do?
  120: Maybe you can stop whoever is doing this.
  121: I'll take a look around.
  122: You're the water thief?! How could you?
  123: Thank you so much for saving us all.
  124: |-
    You did a good job catching the thief. Please hurry and find the water
     chip.
  125: |-
    How could you betray us? Now everyone here will die! But you don't care,
     do you?
  126: |-
    I'm scared. I don't know what will happen to us all. Please, don't let us
     down.
  127: Don't worry, I'll do my best. You'll be all right.
  128: Yeah, whatever.

    [The mutant weakly hands you a bloody Holodisk]
  107: Where did you come from?
  108: We... We were scouting for primes... Came from... From the northwest.
  109: Who sent you?
  110: Father... Where are you father?... Yes Master... [The mutant breathes his last
    breath and collapses]
  111: Uhhhh....  Arrgghh....
  112: Master....
  113: Brothers... Where...?
GANGER:
  100: You see a ghoul gang member.
  101: |-
    What are you doing here? Answer wisely - this could be your
     only chance . . .
  102: I'm looking for the boss.
  103: This building is condemned - I've come to serve final notice.
  104: Sorry, just looking around.
  105: Duh.
  106: Set ain't here, so git.
  107: Oh, OK. Bye.

     so no one can find him.
  109: Well, you'll just have to be my punching bag, then.
  110: |-
    You gots some mental problems to work out. Set's not gonna
     let some loser like you take 'em down. He's got the guards
     and he's got the guns.
  111: How many guards?
  112: What are you doing here?
  113: |-
    Set keeps at least two guards around him at all times,
     but he can call on more then ten if he needs it. And
     when he's in his throne room, those ten guards are seconds
     away.
  114: So what are you doing here?
  115: |-
    I ain't telling ya' that. Whadda ya' think I am, stupid?
     Now git . . .
  116: I'm supposed to make sure no one goes by. Dis is Zombie house.
  117: What's a Zombie?
  118: Well, you have a nice day.
  119: |-
    Not a what . . . A WHO. We are the Zombies. If we do good, Set'll make
     us one of his guards. Now that's all I'm gonna tell you.
  120: Why do you want to be one of his guards?
  121: Bye.
  122: I said dat's all I'm gonna tell ya'. Now git.
  123: You crazy. What do you think dis is? You better leave.
  124: Nah, I want to go in.
  125: OK, I'm out of here.

    I don't think so. Get out before I call the boyz over and
     dance on your face.
  127: Is that a threat?
  128: OK.
  129: It was. Now it's a fact. ZOMBIES!
  130: Stay away from dis place if you value yer life.
  131: HEY, ZOMBIES, WE GOT US A PUNCHIN' BAG!
  132: You should git.

    the Followers of the Apocalypse, and to the Far South I've heard there is some
    kind of church.

     very still!

     could put you out of your misery, or I could fix you up.

  174: Fine. But I hope I perform an autopsy on you by the end of the day!
  175: Ow! You little . . .
  176: Now get out of here, and don't come back!
  177: Fine, I heal you!
  178: That should fix you real good!

     Stupid shithead!

    You have taken some wounds. I can fix that, dickhead, if you stay

    Five broken bones at least, and you've lost lots of blood.
     Being an idiot is hazardous to your health! You want to get fixed?

  107: You think that might be Gunner.
  108: You think that might be Twitch.
  109: You think that might be Hammer.
  110: You think that might be Razor.
  111: Stand down!
  112: What? What do you mean?
  113: Never!
  114: I'm here to talk about peace.
  115: Okay.
  116: I ask the questions here. What are you doing here?
  117: I'm here looking for a friend.
  118: I'm here to talk about peace.
  119: I want to end the gang war!
  120: I want to drink the blood of the Blades!
  121: Then you're looking in the wrong area. Get lost.
  122: |-
    You must be one of those wimpy little purple robes. Get out
     of here before we blow you away.
  123: |-
    Wait! I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here for
     Adytum. They want me to get everyone to leave them alone.
  124: Peace THIS!
  125: Sorry. I'll be going now.
  126: |-
    Hmm. If you are really from Adytum, then you are still a loser.
     There can never be peace while those Rippers are still around.
  127: What do you mean?
  128: Uh, sure.
  129: Ask Razor. She'll explain about those bloodthirsty inbreds.
  130: Get lost!
  131: Hey, now that you are a Blade, I need to ask you a favor.
  132: Sure.
  133: What is it?
  134: No way.
  135: |-
    Great. Take this locket to Julianna. Tell her that I hope
     to see her soon.
  136: |-
    It seems that I have fallen for a girl in Adytum. Because of
     the Regulators shooting us on sight, I can't get close to her.
  137: How can I help?
  138: Go on.
  139: Tough break.
  140: If you take this locket to Julianna, I would be in your debt.
  141: Sure thing.
  142: Find someone else.
  143: With allies like you, who needs enemies? Good bye!
  144: |-
    I think she loves me too, but I don't know. The Blades won't
     risk letting me try to break into Adytum.
  145: Tough break.
  146: Okay, I'll help.
  147: |-
    Thank you! She sent me a note. We are going to meet at
     the Follower's place and get married.
  148: Welcome back.
  149: |-
    Thank you so much. We will stay here with the Followers now,
     where we can be happily married.
RIPPPRIS:
  100: You see a hapless prisoner.
  101: These people are crazy here. Help me get out of here!
  102: No way!
  103: Die!
  104: Okay.
  105: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Good bye!
  106: But . . .
GWEN:
  100: You see Gwen, a desert bandit.
  101: I am Gwen. I'm one of Garl's advisors. Who are you?
  102: 'I''m '
  103: ". What do you do around here?"
  104: I'm nobody special. Can you tell me about your camp?
  105: Hroo?
  106: I am the one who will sweep you off your feet, honey.
  107: |-
    As an advisor, I make sure that no low-lifes
     cause any trouble for Garl.
  108: And how do you do that?
  109: You and what army?
  110: I doubt you could do anything to stop anyone.
  111: Looks like all the low-lifes live here.
  112: |-
    Hmpf. If you're nobody special then I won't bother
     talking to you. Go away.
  113: I keep idiots like you from bothering Garl.  Go away!
  114: I have ways to make certain undesirables are no longer here.
  115: |-
    I can see that I was wrong. You probably could do your
     job well. Good bye.
  116: Prove it!
  117: Die!
  118: |-
    It's been so long since I've had a good fight. Too bad
     you are going to lose. Here is proof of my skills!
  119: You'll regret that remark.  It will be your last!
  120: |-
    If that is the best you can do, then I will be doing the
     world a favor by killing you.
  121: Me and this army!
  122: You annoy me. Leave before I become truly angry.
ASSBLOW:
  100: Kalnor, a Junktown guard.
  101: You'd better watch yourself here.
  102: This isn't a good town to get in trouble in.
  103: Behave, and we won't have to get nasty.
  104: You're OK.
  105: Keep up the good work.
  106: Nice day, isn't it?
  107: |-
    This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on
     our good side.
  108: Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.
  109: I like my boss.
  110: |-
    You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we
     want to keep it that way.
  111: Put what away?
  112: Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.
  113: Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?
  114: Uh, oh.
  115: |-
    Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd
     better damn well keep them in your holster.
  116: Oh, sorry.
  117: No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!
  118: |-
    You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law.
     Put your weapon away. Don't draw it unless in self-defense and
     you won't have a problem with us guards. Disobey the law and we
     will return you to the lawless wasteland--dead or alive.
  119: Sure, since you put it that way.
  120: Bite your laws!
  121: Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.
  122: |-
    Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If
     you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right
     to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just
     cause. Have a good day.
  123: |-
    Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on
     your head as a kid. No weapons.
  124: Hey! You! What are you doing sneaking around?
  125: Nothing.
  126: I'm not sneaking around. I just like to walk cautiously.
  127: Uhhh.
  128: Whatever you're doing, don't do it in this town.
  129: Hey! No shady characters in town! Get out of here before we throw you out!
  130: Well, uh, OK. Whatever. Just don't do anything out of line.
  131: Thanks, bye.
  132: Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, sir.
  133: Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, ma'am.
  134: You'd better watch your step around here, because we'll be watching you.
  135: Welcome to Junktown. What can I do for you?
  136: Nothing, thanks.
  137: What are you doing here? What is this place?
  138: Where can I get some supplies?
  139: Wa-wa!
  140: |-
    I dunno about that. You might want to check with Killian.
     He's to the north. That's up that way, OK?
  141: |-
    What does it look like? I'm a guard, and I'm keeping an eye out for
     strangers like you. And this place is called Junktown. Hey, don't laugh.
     I happen to like the name myself. We mostly do trading. Sometimes we trade
     with those stuck up bastards from Hub. Hey, you're not from the Hub are you?
  142: What? The Hub? Sure I am!
  143: Me? No, I'm not from the Hub.
  144: |-
    Then you must know most of the rules. Have a good day. And I am sorry
     about the bastards part, OK?
  145: Yeah! Hey, no problem. Bye.
  146: It's going to cause me some severe mental trauma. Later.
  147: |-
    Hmmm. OK. It's not our place to ask questions. Have a good day and
     don't make any trouble.
  148: |-
    Oh, heck. The place for that is Darkwater's. Killian runs it.
     It's a little to the north. Killian has the best supplies in town.
  149: Thanks. Bye.
  150: You wanna show me where you keep "your" supplies?
  152: Uh, no. Sorry, lady. I got work to do here.
  153: Have a nice day.
  154: Keep out of trouble.
  155: |-
    Boy, I sure hope my replacement gets here soon. It feels like
     I've been standing guard duty forever.
  156: I'm sorry, the gates are closed for the night. Come back in the morning.
  157: Hey, I need to get in!
  158: No problem. See you in the morning.
  159: |-
    I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but I would like to enter your town.
     You can see that I would cause no harm.
  160: Hunh-huh!
  161: Come . . . back . . . day . . .
  162: Sorry, the rules are the rules. No strangers admitted during the night.
  163: |-
    Well, I shouldn't do this, but you seem like a nice enough person.
     Come on in, but don't make any trouble.
  164: 'Hey! It''s you! Come on in, '
  165: ". Good to see you again!"
  166: Hey, you'd better turn right around and walk back out of here.
  167: Go on in.
DIANA:
  100: You see Diana, a desert raider.
  101: I am Diana. How might I help you today?
  102: I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?
  103: Never mind, thanks.
  104: How about a date?
  105: What do you do here?
  106: What can you tell me about this camp?
  107: Eurrreh?
  108: |-
    If she is one of those women from Shady Sands, maybe you should look there.
     I just work here.
  109: Oh. Well, thank you anyway.
  110: Can you fix my equipment for me?
  111: |-
    As you can see, I am much too busy at the moment to grant you your
     request.
  112: |-
    Garl has me fixing the camp equipment at the moment. I do not have time to
     fix our gear and that of every stranger who walks in. Sorry.
  113: |-
    I am the armorer for this encampment. I am the only one with the
     necessary skills to repair and maintain the weapons and
     equipment of Garl's men.
  114: Can you fix my equipment for me?
  115: What can you tell me about this camp?
  116: |-
    It is run by Garl Death-Hand. He is a fearsome and remorseless
     leader. He makes sure that we all survive the harsh reality of
     the desert.
  117: I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?
  118: Can you fix my equipment for me?
  119: I am busy now. Please go elsewhere.
  120: You are that new friend of Garl's, are you not? What do you want?
  121: Hmm. Your equipment seems to be functional. I have more important tasks.
ORFEO:
  100: You see Orfeo, a Senior Member of the Children of the Cathedral.
  101: Ah. A new convert. Welcome.
  102: Me kill!!!
  103: I am not a convert!
  104: Thank you, Brother.
  105: Then we shall take care of that problem shortly.
  106: We must first cleanse you from the impurities of the wastelands. Come.
  107: We will cleanse you!
TALIUS:
  100: You see before you Talius, a member of the Followers.
  101: Please depart. I am attempting to retire here. Come back during the day.
  102: Greetings sister. My name is Talius. How might I assist you today?
  103: Greetings brother. My name is Talius. How might I assist you today?
  104: Huh?
  105: 'Me '
  106: ". Me "
  107: "."
  108: 'I am '
  109: ". What are you doing here?"
  110: You can die!
  111: Don't worry about me Mutie! How did you get in here?
  112: 'Greetings to you as well. I am called '
  113: ". How is it that you came into the realm of the Followers?"
  114: Can you tell me how one, of your alterations, entered the Followers?
  115: |-
    I see that you are a little slow. I, too, was once of your intelligence.
     But, through the teachings of the Followers, I have been able to transcend
     my shortcomings.
  116: No know.
  117: Too smart. Die now.
  118: I apologize. I forget myself at times. Would you like some brain help?
  119: Yeah. You's!
  120: You hep. You hep!
  121: Here. Take these pretty pills. Make you smarter.
  122: 'Yes, '
  123: |-
    . I am enthusiastic that you acknowledge your given
     nomenclature. How might I assist you this fine morrow?
  124: Wha?
  125: Brain hurt. Me kill you. Take brain.
  126: |-
    I am here to assist these good people in understanding the workings
     of the Children of the Cathedral.
  127: So you are a spy for the Children?
  128: How can you know anything about the Children?
  129: What can you do? You are a mutant.
  130: |-
    Nay, I am no spy. Though many think as such. There is a spy within
     our humble abode. Yet, we are unable to ferret the spy out.
  131: Then how do you help the Followers?
  132: Tell me what you know about this spy. Maybe I can help.
  133: Tough luck, Mutie!
  134: I think I found the spy. Now I will remove the problem.
  135: |-
    Once, I was as you are. But, through the interaction of the Nightkin
     in Necropolis, I was thrust into this state.
  136: That's awful. But, tough luck. See you around.
  137: Why were you in Necropolis?
  138: Where were you from originally?
  139: And now I will transform you once more. Rest in pieces.
  140: |-
    Some time ago, I lived in a place far to the north of here. They were having
     a problem with the water supply and sought out people to find a way to fix it.
  141: So you volunteered.
  142: Where was this place?
  143: Did you find a way to fix this problem?
  144: But why Necropolis?
  145: |-
    Yes. The overseer of the community gave me a shotgun and some shells.
     However, those were lost many years passed. Since I have never found anything,
     I could not return.
  146: That's really awful. I wish there was something I could do.
  147: Too bad. Gotta head out.
  148: Where was this place?
  149: Did you ever find a way to fix the water problem?
  150: Why did you go to Necropolis?
  151: |-
    There is a way in which you can help. The one who did this to me must
     be stopped.
  152: Who is it?
  153: |-
    Their leader is the head of a mutant army. What he does is take
     pure humans and transform them. I'm not quite sure, because I was knocked
     unconscious before the process.
  154: I will go kill them for you then.
  155: Sounds too risky for me. I'm out of here.
  156: |-
    I thank you for your kindness. You do me a great service. Please,
     accept this as a token of good will. I purloined it from the body of a
     deceased renegade.
  157: |-
    Be at peace then. I can understand your unease. Mayhaps another will
     come to help remove this threat. Good day to you.
  158: |-
    The place from whence I came was in the mountains far to the north.
     It was a small vault in which many people lived.
  159: Did you ever find a way to fix the water problem?
  160: Why did you go to Necropolis?
  161: What was the name of this Vault?
  162: Sounds nice. I've gotta run.
  163: |-
    Unfortunately, I did not. I have heard that others were sent from the
     vault to search for a way to fix the water pump.
  164: I have heard nothing more of them.
  165: Why did you go to Necropolis?
  166: What was the name of this Vault?
  167: Sounds nice. I've gotta run.
  168: |-
    I heard from some of the other travelers that Necropolis had a way in
     which to produce water without much difficulty.
  169: So, I went there to see what they were doing.
  170: What did you find?
  171: Did you kill them off?
  172: Feel at home there?
  173: |-
    I found a great deal of those Mutant things there. It was they who
     entrapped me and transformed me into my current form.
  174: |-
    Apparently, they messed up, because I took on a different evolutionary
     course, rather than the enhanced ones.
  175: Rough deal. See you around.
  176: I'll be sure to watch out for them. Thanks for the info.
  177: Who lead them?
  178: |-
    No. I killed only some of the mutants. There was another mutant,
     a ghoul, named Set, who helped me take out most of them.
  179: Last I knew there were only half a dozen mutants left.
  180: That sounds great. Well, I will see you around.
  181: The rest of them are gone now. Set is doing fine.
  182: |-
    That is good news indeed to hear. I am overjoyed to hear the destruction
     of one evil and a town set free. Please, take this.
  183: |-
    Sarcasm and slights shall not deter me my benevolent disposition.
     The time has come for you to depart. Good day.
  184: My vault had no name. It was merely numbered 13.
  185: That is where I am from.
  186: Never heard of the place.
  187: Thanks for the info. Now I'm going to tell those Mutants about it.
  188: |-
    Really? Has the Overseer finally seen his way through to allow people
     to travel outside the Vault?
  189: No, he is still scared of the outside world.
  190: No, he fears for the safety of the dwellers.
  191: Yes, he thinks everything is safe.
  192: |-
    I believed as such. He always was a cautious man. I pity him his
     responsibility. May you fare better than myself on this fool's quest.
  193: |-
    I am glad to hear that he has come to his senses to allow the people out.
     While it is far from safe out here, it will do good to restore the earth
     once more. Farewell, my friend.
  194: |-
    I doubt you would have, coming from the outside world. Now, I must retire.
     Please be careful out there with those creatures who see to destroy.
  195: Nay, I doubt you would be able to do as such.
  196: Try and stop me.
  197: Why do you say that?
  198: Because I will stop you.
  199: |-
    I know very little. The only things I know are that our scouts are the
     only ones who ever go over to the Children to spy on them. No one else
     is allowed because of the danger.
  200: Then it might be a scout. I will look into that.
  201: I think that it is you. Now die!
  202: |-
    I wish you would have been of greater intellect. No matter, I shall
     dispense with you shortly.
  203: |-
    All I know of the Children is that they are in league with these
     Nightkin, super mutants.
  204: It is they who transformed me from my original state of being in Necropolis.
  205: That's awful. But, tough luck. See you around.
  206: Why were you in Necropolis?
  207: Where were you from originally?
  208: And now I will transform you once more. Rest in pieces.
  209: |-
    Though I am different in appearance, I have much knowledge to impart
     upon those who will listen.
  210: I have no time for this, I'm leaving.
  211: What can you tell me?
  212: |-
    Those whom the Followers and Children call Nightkin are not what they
     seem. They have been created by one called the Lieutenant. I believe he may
     follow another.
  213: Some information. Well, I will be off.
  214: What can you tell me about this Lieutenant?
  215: |-
    There isn't much that I know about him. Last I saw him, before my
     untimely transformation, he was searching for pure humans.
  216: I will think on this for a while. Thank you.
  217: Can you hazard a hypothesis as to why this may be so?
  218: |-
    As yet, I am uncertain. Perhaps another group which seeks to disrupt
     their ways would know.
  219: Thank you. Good day.
  220: I regret that I cannot tolerate insolence. Be gone.
  221: |-
    My entrance into the Followers was quite simple really. It was the
     Followers who rescued me from the full effects of the transformation into
     a heinous beast.
  222: I do not fully understand. Please, go on.
  223: |-
    Once, I was as you are now - a pure human. But, through the intervention
     of Nightkin, I was taken to some place far removed from here.
  224: Please, continue.
  225: |-
    I was not of a state in which to observe what transpired. All I
     had known was that I awoke here and was tended by the good doctor.
  226: |-
    I am truly sorry to hear of your predicament. I will find those
     who did this to you and remedy the situation.
  227: |-
    I am sorry to hear of that. Alas, I am quite busy attempting to
     survive. Farewell.
  228: |-
    Please, dispense justice upon the defouler who seeks to undermine
     the trust of the Followers.
  229: Excellent job on removing from our midst that dissembler, Heather.
  230: You see a hideous ghoul.
  231: Somehow, he reminds you of someone.
  232: Alas, I have no more time to spare on you. Good day.
MRHANDYA:
  100: You see a broken robot.
  101: You see a functional robot.
  102: |-
    You fix the broken robot. It immediately powers up
     and comes to life.
  103: The repairs are beyond your skills.
VALTCUPL:
  100: You see a citizen of Vault 13.
  101: |-
    We didn't think that you were coming back. You have
     such a nice room, and we were a little crowded with
     her parents. I hope you don't mind.
  102: Yes, I do mind. Get out of my room!
  103: Nah, I don't care. Enjoy the room.
  104: |-
    It would be reassuring to have my own quarters back.
     Please find somewhere else to live.
  105: Hng.
  106: |-
    Look, I don't want to argue with you, but you
     obviously don't deserve this room anymore. Please leave.
  107: Look, we could really use the space. I hope you will reconsider.
  108: |-
    Well, let me think about it for a moment.
     Hmmm. No. Get out!
  109: Well, ok. You need it more than I do.
  110: Thanks! We really appreciate it. We put your stuff in the trunk.
  111: |-
    Well, I don't know. You don't seem to be using it very
     often, and we sure could use the space.
  112: Fine. Take it.
  113: |-
    I need this place to remember my roots. And besides,
     it's a good place to rest.
  114: |-
    Gee, I didn't think you would still care about this place from what
     I've heard. You have a good day. We'll go back to her mothers' place.
  115: We really like it here.
  116: You should leave. This isn't your place here anymore.
GENGRDB:
  100: Your arrival was timely, friend. Best wishes for a safe journey.
  101: We could use your assistance!
  102: I am going to kill you!
  103: Leave me alone!
  104: Protect the caravan!
CHARBODY:
  100: This person must have been very close to the blast.
  101: This body is so charred, you cannot even guess what it once was.
  102: The shifting winds have caused some of the ashes to drift away.
  103: The nuclear blast must have done this damage.
  104: Ashes fall through your fingers.
ROBOT:
  100: Peace to you.
  101: Exterminate!
  102: Kill the human!
  103: Kill the intruder!
  104: "[Brrzk!] Death to flesh!"
  105: "[Breep!] No peace. No peace."
CORECOMP:
  100: This computer monitors the machines maintaining the Vault.
  101: |-
    Most of your computer access has been removed by order
     of the Vault AI system.
  102: |-
    This is the Vault 13 Central Computer Core.
     It controls most of the workstations you
     find in the Vault.
  103: |-
    You fiddle with the computer but don't really find out anything else
     about it.
  104: There are lots of blinking lights on this thing.
FOLSCHOL:
  100: You see a studious Follower of the Apocolypse.
  101: Please be quite, I am trying to study.
  102: We seek knowledge to protect us from the Children.
  103: Nicole says that knowledge of our enemies will help us prevail.
  104: Hello.
  105: Welcome to the Followers of the Apocolypse.  Please respect the sanctity of
    our Library.
  106: Glorious Day to you.
  107: All knowledge is holy.
  108: We must protect ourselves.
  109: Who knows what goes on below the Children's Cathedral?
  110: Knowledge is life.
  111: Nicole helps us understand the holliness of knowledge.
  112: Nicole drives us to resurrect what has been lost.
  113: I must find that book for Nicole.
  114: Katja must be around here somewhere.  Katja!
  115: The Children have been driven from the Cathedral.
  116: You were the one, weren't you?
  117: Now, we are safe to discover the knowledge needed to rebuild civilization.
  118: Isn't it glorious that the Children are no longer a threat?
  119: Glorious Day to you.
CLEO:
  100: You see Cleo.
  101: No retreat, no surrender,  pal.
  102: No retreat, no surrender, lady.

  113: Tell me about Loxley.
  114: Tell me about Jasmine.
  115: Tell me about the Circle.
  116: Tell me about Decker.
  117: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  118: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  119: Hi.
  120: Um, ugh!
  121: He's the boss. What else is there to know?
  122: Tell me about Jasmine.
  123: Tell me about the Circle.
  124: Tell me about Decker.
  125: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  126: Hi.

  135: Um, ugh!
  136: |-
    If you're lucky, you'll consider yourself one of us by the end of the day. At home, part of the
     furniture, you know?
  137: Tell me about Loxley.
  138: Tell me about Jasmine.
  139: Tell me about Decker.
  140: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  141: Hi.
  142: Um, ugh!
  143: We don't discuss Mr. Decker in polite company.
  144: Tell me about Loxley.
  145: Tell me about Jasmine.
  146: Tell me about the Circle.
  147: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  148: Hi.
  149: Um, ugh!
  150: We had nothing to do with that!
  151: Tell me about Loxley.
  152: Tell me about Jasmine.
  153: Tell me about the Circle.
  154: Tell me about Decker.
  155: Hi.
  156: Um, ugh!
  157: Hi yourself.
  158: Why do you even bother talking to people, moron?
  159: |-
    A great leader. He's doing everything to screw over the right people and keep the Hub together --
     for a small fee, of course.
  160: Tell me about Jasmine.
  161: Tell me about the Circle.
  162: Tell me about Decker.
  163: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  164: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  165: Hi.
  166: Um, ugh!
  167: |-
    It's both a job and an adventure. Helping the poor, risking your life, meeting new and interesting
     blokes. That us, the good guys!
  168: Tell me about Loxley.
  169: Tell me about Jasmine.
  170: Tell me about Decker.
  171: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  172: Tell me about the missing caravans.
  173: Hi.
  174: Um, ugh!
  175: |-
    I had a friend who worked for him once. When the assignment went bad, he ran back to Decker for
     reinforcements. Decker called him a fool, and he had him lobotomized as an example to others. We don't
     like Decker very much around here.
  176: |-
    What rumors do you want to hear? The Water Merchants are playing games. Decker's squeezing merchants
     for more protection. The Children of the Cathedral sacrificed it to their god. The Deathclaw ate it. Rumors
     ain't worth nothing. The world's full of rumor and suspicion, and empty of truth.  Look for fact, not
     fiction. But why are you asking? You had friends on the caravan?
  177: I can't talk about my reasons.
  178: I promised a friend I'd look into it.
  179: I need water for my town and can't afford to have caravans disappear.
  180: Yeah, I had a friend.
  181: Fine. I got secrets, too. Good luck, friend.
  182: |-
    Sorry I can't be more useful. Oh, and then there's the rumor about the ship from outer space. I think
     someone's been playing around with too many of Rufus's stupid games.
  183: Really? Where are you from?
  184: Shady Sands.
  185: A place just north of Shady Sands.
  186: Vault 13.
  187: Here and there. I do odd jobs for places which let me stick around.
  188: |-
    Sorry to hear that. I've lost a couple of good friends in my time, and one of them I found worse than
     dead, but I'd rather not go into it.
  189: Didn't we already discuss that? You've got a one-track mind, pal.
  190: |-
    Not a bad place if you like sand. A little too dry and wilderness for me. At least in the Hub you don't
     have to worry about wandering Rad Scorpions. We've got enough of our own predators, I suppose.
  191: You're from a Vault? Get out of here! Don't go feeding me that bull.
  192: |-
    I don't envy you. Of course if you make a name for yourself, you can become one of those wilderness
     fighting legends like Magnum Tom Goddard or Scorpion Joe Cornelius. Man, that must be something!
RAIDMAP:
  100: 'You gain '
  101: " experience points for freeing Tandi."
  102: " experience points for befriending the Khans."
  103: " experience points for the rescue of a slave."
GHGENDED:
  100: You see a lifeless corpse laying on the ground.
  101: An unfortunate soul lays here.
  102: The remains of a mutated human rest upon the floor.
  103: The feeding grounds for carrion.
  104: It appears this person challenged Thanatos and lost.
GLOWONE:
  100: You see a glowing creature.
  101: Mmmm . . .
  102: Ahhh . . .
  103: |-
    The glowing one mumbles something and is then silent. He is
     drooling uncontrollably
  104: There is no response.
LOCKER:
  100: The locker is locked.
  101: You broke your lockpicks.
  102: You unlock the locker.
  103: You fail to unlock the locker.
DEMOPEAS:
  100: You see a peasant.
  101: |-
    Oh, yeah, big man running from a scary dog. Phil,
     you sure showed it. Yep, you sure did.
  102: |-
    What are you doing, Phil? You're checking the tread on those
     sneakers, aren't you?
  103: |-
    Man, that dog looks hungry. It sure wants to eat you alive,
     Phil.
  104: |-
    That might be a little overkill for a poor
     defenseless animal, don'cha think?
  105: That sure is a nice pooch you have there.
  106: |-
    I'm sure Phil would appreciate it if you were
     to get rid of his dog.
  107: Thanks for dealing with that dog.
  108: You get 50 experience points.
TRISH:
  100: You see Trish, a waitress from the Skum Pitt.
  101: What the hell are you doing in my room?
  102: Gug!
  103: Whoops, sorry. I thought this was my room.
  104: Sorry. Bye.
  105: |-
    No way! I'm not into that! Go talk to Sinthia down the hall. She might
     be available, but she is never free.
  106: Yeah, right. Whatever. This is my room. Get the hell out.
  107: What the hell are you doing in my room?
  108: Grub!
  109: Whoops, sorry. I thought this was my room.
  110: Do you know a guy named Saul?
  111: I used to think so. Now, I'm not so sure.
  112: He really cares about you.
  113: I think you should dump him.
  114: So he says. If he did, he wouldn't be doing what he is doing.
  115: What's that?
  116: His boxing, right?
  117: You would say that. you want to take his place right?
  118: Nah. You're too shanky.
  119: Sure.
  120: Just leave me alone.
  121: |-
    Maybe you're right. Maybe I need to understand what he does and leave it
     at that.
  122: His fighting, of course. I don't get it.
  123: It's a man thing.
  124: Of course not, dearie.
  125: |-
    Of course it's his boxing. He's a really nice guy, but he needs
     to get out of it before it kills him.
  126: Maybe that's what he wants to do.
  127: Hey, I met you at the Skum Pitt. What the hell are you doing in my room?
  128: Plato
  129: I wanted to get a closer look at you.
  130: |-
    I wanted to get some info from you, and I didn't want to do it in front
     of that bartender.
  131: |-
    Just leave me the hell alone, you loser. Sinthia might be your kind
     of woman, but I sure as hell ain't.
  132: You should leave me alone. I really don't want to talk to you.
  133: Sorry to disturb you.
  134: Get out of my room!
  135: I'm gonna get Marcelles, and she'll clean your clock.
  136: My boyfriend could beat you up.
  137: Look, this is my room. Please leave.
  138: Thanks for helping out with Saul. He's really a neat guy.
  139: |-
    You got my boyfriend killed. I should hate you, but I knew it was going
     to happen sooner or later. Please leave me alone.
  140: |-
    Hey, thanks for helping me out when those Skulz jumped me. There aren't many
     people willing to do that sort of thing these days.
  141: Hnnn.
  142: You're welcome. See you around.
  143: You're welcome. Could I ask you a few questions?
  144: I guess so.
  145: Who owns the bar?
  146: Who is Gizmo?
  147: Why did you scream about Saul?
  148: Thanks, bye.
  149: |-
    Neal owns the bar. He's a good guy, always treated me right. We
     used to date, but he got a little too serious for my liking. I don't want
     to be a widow.
  150: Oh! Saul, where are you?!?
  151: Zzzz
  152: Sorry, we're closed. Come back later.
  153: Nothing, thanks.
  154: |-
    Gizmo runs the Casino. He would like to take over Neal's bar, but Neal
     doesn't want to sell.
  155: |2-
     Killian and Gizmo do not like each other. One of them will either have
     to leave town or be buried beneath it.
  156: Welcome to the Skum Pitt. Can I get you something to drink?
  157: Yes, what do you have?
  158: Saul is my boyfriend. He's really good to me.
  159: Actually, can I ask you some questions?
  160: |-
    No, as a matter of fact, you can't. If you aren't going to order a drink,
     then you're in the wrong place.
  161: What would you like?
  162: |-
    Gizmo, well, Gizmo means to take over the bar. And if Neal won't sell,
     I bet some bad things will happen.
  163: |-
    One day, some punk is going to kill Neal for a glass of friggin' water
     or something stupid like that. In case you haven't noticed, running a bar
     is tough work these days.
  164: Nuka-cola, 3 caps.
  165: Beer, 5 caps.
  166: The hard stuff, 20 caps.
  167: You see a waitress.
  168: Still, working for Gizmo is going to kill him.
  169: |-
    No, but you can't change him, and he can't change you. If you don't like
     what he does, then you should look elsewhere.
  170: Hnnngh! Hoo!
  171: Sorry, it looks like you're already a little gone.
  172: |-
    You gain 300 experience points for helping to defeat the Skulz in the
     bar fight.
  173: You gain 250 experience points for saving Saul and Trish's relationship.
  174: Here you go. Enjoy.
LENORE:
  100: You see a peasant.
  101: |-
    Oh, yeah, big man running from a scary dog. Phil,
     you sure showed it. Yep, you sure did.
  102: |-
    What are you doing, Phil? You're checking the tread on those
     sneakers, aren't you?
  103: |-
    Man, that dog looks hungry. It sure wants to eat you alive,
     Phil.
  104: |-
    That might be a little overkill for a poor
     defenseless animal, don'cha think?

  106: |-
    I'm sure Phil would appreciate it if you were
     to get rid of his dog.
  107: Thanks for dealing with that dog.
  108: You see Lenore.
GIDEON:
  100: You see Gideon, a normal looking human. He is wearing a crown.
  101: Jason is a living god! Only the nullified may pass!
  102: |-
    Nullified? Are they somehow restricting your psychic powers by those
     devices you are wearing?
  103: Who's Jason?
  104: What do you mean by nullified?
  105: |-
    I just killed him, so he must be a dead god, now. Would you like to
     join him?
  106: Huh?
  107: The walls also have minds . . . I saw you . . . tomorrow?
  108: Others like you are in the wall?
  109: Never mind.
  110: I'd like to kill you now. Could you open this force field?
  111: Open the forcefield and I'll let you out.
  112: Uh, yeah. Are you the 'experiments' I'm looking for?
  113: Jason? Who's Jason?
  114: You just said . . . nevermind.
  115: Stup.
  116: Yes, the walls are alive with those that have gone before.
  117: What happened to them?
  118: Uh, I've got to go.
  119: Meeting of the soul . . . melded with, to protect, the Master of all.
  120: I see. How do I protect myself from the protectors of the Master?
  121: What about the dogs of war?
  122: I need to protect the Master. How do I get to him?
  123: |-
    I can kill anyone or anything. Open this forcefield and I'll
     demonstrate.
  124: Goodbye.
  125: |-
    There is only peace and joining . . . the price . . . the pain . . . one must be
     blind . . . nulled.
  126: Well, I need to join. Where can I pick up one of those snazzy nullifiers?
  127: Great! How do I join?
  128: I'd like to join my gun with your head!
  129: I don't have time for this. Goodbye.
  130: I will anoint you . . . I must give what I must not.
  131: Thanks.
  132: No one's anointing me, you insane bastard!
  133: Anoint? Anoint me with what?
  134: No, thanks.
  135: You cannot kill the genius of . . . the all . . .  you . . . hehf!
  136: Yeah, but I can cause it one hell of a lot of pain.
  137: I don't want to kill. I want to worship.
  138: Obviously. Goodbye.
  139: Phlegm! Insubstantial development . . . communication, null . . . end of death.
  140: The walls also have minds . . . I saw you . . . tomorrow was it?
  141: I'll take that as a yes.
  142: Great! How do I join?
  143: The blasphemous . . . decompose . . . death will be . . . salvation . . . strong!
  144: The minds . . . the walls . . . before the great one.
  145: Those who have gone before . . . must stop your journey.
  146: I need to change that.
  147: I must complete my journey -- the master wills it.
  148: Who? Did what?
  149: Yeah, but I can cause them a whole lot of pain.
  150: Sorry to disturb you again. Goodbye.
  151: I'd like to help you escape.
  200: You see Moore, a scruffy looking fellow. He is wearing a crown.
  201: You see a scruffy looking fellow.
  202: The asphalt shall run red! I will crush!
  203: Exactly.
  204: What are you talking about?
  205: Yeah, it'll be red with your blood.
  206: Uh, yeah. Goodbye.
  207: Urgh!
  208: I will stop the motor! The master gave me the power . . .
  209: Okay, Hank. I'd like to meet the Master, how do I get there?
  210: What motor?
  211: Of course! I understand completely . . .
  212: I'd like to split your head open, you blithering idiot.
  213: Oh, not you again. Goodbye.
  214: Only the powerful can pass, but they will be kept from passing.
  215: Open this force field, I want to show you my power.
  216: But I have to see the Master!
  217: Can you show me how?
  218: Gideon . . . Gideon speaks the way.
  219: Exactly.

  305: What about this place? Isn't this your home?
  306: |-
    I agree. Completely and utterly. You're right . . . [she pauses for a
     moment.] What did you say? Oh, never you mind.
  307: |-
    [looking at you intensely] I will slay you for that! I will make your
     blood run red. Wait a minute. Blood is red, how can I make it run red? I
     can't very well do that. Hmmm. I need to think about this. Go away!
  308: |-
    My home is, uh, yeah. Here. Yeah, it's here. This is my home! [she
     jumps up and down] I am so happy! You can't believe how happy this makes me.
     I think I'm going to go punch the wall for a while.
  309: |-
    I'm busy. I almost have the solution to the environmental problems
     fucking this world over, but I can't stop thinking about purple dinosaurs.
     Is this a problem?
  310: Stop bugging me, I'm thinking . . .
  400: You see Wiggum, a complete loser. He is wearing a crown.

    There's enough water to go around for everyone.
     Set makes sure of that.
  112: I heard that the mutants got run out of town.
  113: Ever since the mutants left, it's been better.
  114: Hello.
  200: |-
    You examine the pitiful thing, but can not figure out what might
     have made it the way it is.
  201: |-
    It seems to have been human once, or at least descended from
     humans. You guess that the deteriation in the body is most likely due
     to acid or radiation.
  202: |-
    The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, but still
     functioning. While it was once human, it seems to have reverted to a
     more animalistic lifestyle.
  203: |-
    The body of the humanoid looks to be higly irradiated, and much
     of the muscle and brain matter seem to have deteriorated. However, genetic
     indicators lead you to believe that it desceded, like you, from those
     that entered the Vaults.
CHANTER:
  100: You see a Chanter of the Children.

    The Master will forgive your sins! Join us and be free! Praise to

  103: Where might I meet this Master?
  104: Go ahead.
  105: Who's in charge here?
  106: Master's Vision? Is it better than Rad Scorpion Juice?
  107: Does it end in death? If not, I can change that!
  108: Me like story!
  109: |-
    The Master looks above! The Master sits below! Watch the Peace and
     the Unity grow!
  110: |-
    There was once a man who was so full of hate that he nearly died.
     But now . . . Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! Praise the Vineyard

    You are in charge, friend, but the Master is your guide. Praise

    The Master's vision is much better than any drink, or even sex!
     Ohhhh! He transcends both vice and virtue! Ahhhh! The Master is both
     father and lover to us all!

    I'm sorry, but I don't have the time for this.  If you can't pay the full amount, give me what money
     you do have and our business relationship will be terminated permanently.
  249: Well, OK.  You can have all of my caps.
  250: Oh!  I just remembered!  I have just enough to cover the whole loan!

    Yea, being a Knight would be great, they see lots of action and

    The Rippers even have a minefield around their fort! Makes you
     wonder what Julianna was thinking.
  131: What do you mean about Julianna?
  132: Very nasty. Can I ask some other things?
  133: Thanks for the warning.
  134: |-
    Oh, she wound up falling for some Ripper a while ago. Poor
     dear can't leave the town, of course, and Caleb would kill
     the young lad on sight. Very tragic.
  135: Uh . . . if you say so.
  136: Can I ask some other questions?
  137: Hmm. Thanks for filling me in. Bye.
  138: |-
    We only scavenge after dark. And we're very good at what we
     do. Sammael's got a little test that he likes to throw out
     at people, before he lets them become Scavs.
  139: What's the test?
  140: Still sounds dangerous.
  141: I see. Mind if we back up a bit?
  142: Interesting. Bye.
  143: |-
    Sammael has the person hide somewhere within Adytum during the
     day. If he can't find the student in an hour, then he lets
     the person join the next scavenger party.
  144: What a stupid system!
  145: Seems to work. You're still alive.
  146: Huh. Can I ask you about some other things?
  147: Interesting. Bye.
  148: |-
    Come now, isn't there the faintest trace of a romantic in
     you? Really, it's too bad. Unrequited love and all of that.
     Tragic.
  149: |-
    Hmpf. Shows what you know. Tell that to Sammael. If you
     can find him.
  150: |-
    Yes, although it can be rough. It's very dangerous, especially
     if you're caught.
  151: No doubt. Can I ask about something else?
  152: Thanks for the info.
  153: Wow, I think you're a little beyond my help.
  154: |-
    This used to be a big city, called Los Angeles. But the
     bombs hit really hard. Now, there's just the Angel's
     Boneyard. We Adytowners are just trying to survive in the
     wreckage.
  155: Can you tell me more about Los Angeles?
  156: I see. Thanks.
  157: |-
    Lots of people lived here, and they did important things like
     making computer games. From what I hear, the survivors hid in
     a big place called a Vault, and came out years later. Some of
     them founded Adytum, but the
  158: |-
    others formed the street gangs, the Blades and the
     Rippers. The Gun Runners aren't from here originally.
  159: Where is this Vault?
  160: Tell me about the gangs.
  161: Where are the Gun Runners from?
  162: Making computer games? Doesn't sound very important to me.
  163: Thanks for your help.
  164: |-
    Well, supposedly it was somewhere south of here, but I don't
     know really. I think everyone left because it was broken.
  165: Can I ask you some more questions?
  166: Hmm. Thanks.
  167: |-
    I'm not really sure. I think they came from somewhere up
     north of here.
  168: Tell me about the other gangs.
  169: Can I ask about some other things?
  170: Thanks for the information.
  171: |-
    Who do you want to know about, Zimmerman, Caleb, Miles,
     Taylor, or Smitty?
  172: Jon Zimmerman.
  173: Caleb.
  174: Miles.
  175: Taylor.
  176: Smitty.
  177: Nobody.
  178: |-
    Zimmerman watches over our town. He makes sure that everyone
     gets fed, and that everybody has a job to do.
  179: |-
    Caleb is the leader of the Regulators. It's his job to
     protect Adytum. He's very strict, but he means well.
  180: |-
    Ah, our resident chemist. Miles makes bullets, and he also
     built the water distiller that makes sure we get clean
     water from the well. He's working on an underground
     farm right now, but he's missing some parts.
  181: |-
    Taylor runs the shop. It's in the bunker near the gate.
     He trades with the Hub merchants for us.
  182: |-
    Hm. Smitty is a tinker of sorts. He's good at repair work.
     He casts bullets and fixes broken stuff around town.
  183: Can I ask about someone else?
  184: Can we talk about a different subject?
  185: Thanks.
  186: |-
    Are you kidding? Without computer games, you wouldn't be playing
     this, now would you?
IRWIN:
  100: You see Irwin.
  101: Oh boy, can't you leave me alone? I have enough problems on my hands already.
  102: Problems? Maybe I can help you.
  103: Like you are the only one with problems.
  104: Okay, okay. No reason to yell at me.
  105: Hmm... I don't know. It takes a different caliber of hero than you. Listen,
    why don't you come back when you have a little more experience under your belt?
  106: This is a tragedy, believe me. Nothing is the way it used to be. I have a small
    farm outside town and a few days ago a bunch of Raiders appeared out of nowhere
    and now use my home as their camp. They killed Pugsley, my donkey and they threatened
    to kill me if I ever dare to come back.
  107: Just tell me where and I'll take care of the rest.
  108: Sorry Irwin, but I have more important things to do.
  109: Really, you would do that? You know, I don't dare to go there any more. Why
    don't you come back and let me know when it is safe to go back home again?
  110: Listen freak, I told you to let me alone in the first place. Now beat it!
  111: I knew you would chicken out. Everyone does when it comes to the Raiders.
  112: So, have you been able to teach those Raiders a lesson? Is my home safe again?
  113: It sure is, buddy.
  114: I didn't have the time yet to take care of it.
  115: Oh, thank you so much. I am sorry I don't have any riches to give to you, but
    here, take this rifle for saving my home.
  116: You're trying to fool me, right? Please don't play with me. Come back and let
    me know when it is really safe to get back into my home, will you?
  117: Thank you so much for helping me.
  118: Grunk?
  119: Look, I don't have time for idiots.  Come back when you've got some smarts.
  120: Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh.  I dood it.
  121: Me no fix yet.
  300: Meet your maker!
  301: Get him... dead!
  302: You have just had your last cheesebread!
  303: I'll perforate you like some swiss cheese!
RADSCORP:
  100: The Rad Scorpion beckons you to come closer.
SCRIBEB:
  100: Scribe
  101: Vree's my idol.

  103: Sophia sure is nice.
  104: Derek is the bee's knees.
  105: |-
    Will the universe continue to expand, or will it eventually
     collapse back in on itself?
  106: |-
    I love those old books and magazines, but they are so hard
     to come by.
  107: Knowledge is power.
  108: The pen is mightier than the sword.
  109: Technology must be preserved.
  110: Science is so much fun.
  111: I've seen an alien space ship before.
  112: |-
    Did you know that the sun is actually a big nuclear reaction?
     Similar to what ended the old world, except it's fission,
     no fusion.
  113: |-
    Did you know that a black hole is actually an opening to another
     universe? I have it all worked out on paper. Too bad
     there won't be any more space travel until long after I'm dead.
  114: Did you know that the hydrogen atom is 99.9843425% empty space?
  115: |-
    Time travel will one day be possible and we might be able to
     prevent the disaster that ruined our world in the past. But
     wouldn't that . . . stop us from going back if it was fixed . . .
     oh, my head hurts.
DEAD:
  100: Dead bodies . . .
  101: They were recently killed by some sort of animal.
  102: They were recently killed.
  103: They might be sleeping.
  104: They're dead.

    The guard room is for guards. You are not a guard.
     You are in the guardroom. Therefore, YOU should leave.
  104: Please leave. You shouldn't be here.

VATALERT:
  100: There is something odd about that part of the floor.
  101: You notice nothing special.
  102: An alarm sounds in the distance.
  103: There is some sort of sensor at your feet.
  104: You disarm the sensor.
  105: You fail to disarm the sensor.
HIGHELD:
  100: You see an Elder of the Brotherhood.
  101: Greetings Initiate. I need to speak with you. (He motions for you to come closer.)
  102: About what?
  103: I don't have time right now.
  104: Err?
  105: |-
    There is an urgent matter I need you to help me
     with. It's Maxson. We are pretty sure he's gone off the
     deep end. He keeps babbling about an army massing to the
     north.
  106: |2-
     I'm not willing to send our troops up there into
     possibly radiated areas, unless I've got absolute proof
     that this "army" exists.
  107: |2-
     I need someone who isn't a friend of the old man.
     Someone I can get an honest report from. Are you willing to check
     the northern region?
  108: I'll do it.
  109: I can't do it right now. I've got other things I need to deal with.
  110: I've already seen a base to the north run by an army of mutants.
  111: |-
    Good. First go talk to Maxson if you haven't already. Report back
     to me when you've checked the northern territory. After that, we'll decide
     what to do with Maxson.
  112: Wish me luck.
  113: Have you explored the entire northern territory?
  114: Yes.
  115: No.
  116: And what do you have to report?
  117: I've found a base guarded by heavily armed mutants. It looks pretty bad.
  118: |-
    I didn't think so. You weren't gone for very long. Now, get back out there and
     don't come back until you have a FULL report.
  119: Yes, sir.
  120: |-
    I will inform the Elders. We will wait for Maxson's word on what to do.
     Go inform him on what you've found. Thanks for your help, Initiate.
  121: You're welcome.
  122: Then you will make time to hear me out.
  123: You've got my attention.
  124: You can go to hell old man.
  125: Forget it. I've got more important things to do.
  126: I understand. If you do travel up into that area and find anything, please,
    let me know.
  127: If I find anything that resembles an army up north, I will let you know.
  128: |-
    Good work with the mutants. We already heard that you destroyed their
     production facility. Thanks for taking care of that problem for us.
  129: No problem.
  130: Err? What kind of response is Err? Leave! Now!
  131: If it was up to me, you would be out of here.
  132: I have nothing to say to you.
  133: You should learn some respect.
  134: "The meeting will come to order. All Elders are present and have\n agreed to
    hear out the claims of Brother "
  135: ". We shall determine what actions will be taken. Brother "
  136: ", tell us what you have seen to the north."
  137: |-
    During my explorations, I found a military installation being used
     by mutants. It is heavily guarded and patrolled regularly.
  138: Norfa?
  139: And what did these mutants look like?
  140: |-
    They are large humanoids. Their muscle mass is well beyond what a
     regular human could ever gain. There appear to be several of them guarding the
     gate in organized troops.
  141: They were big, greenish, and carrying weapons.
  142: |-
    As you may know, our Head Scribe, Vree, has done an autopsy on a
     creature very similar to what you have just described. Do you believe these
     are the same?
  143: Yes. The description of the creature is nearly identical.
  144: What threat do you assume these "mutants" pose?
  145: |-
    Just as the Brotherhood has been gearing up for battle, this "mutant
     army" has been preparing for something big.
  146: |-
    Frankly, your report has not shown us any proof that they are a
     threat to us. What proof can you give that they have hostile intentions.
  147: 'They have invaded Necropolis. They won''t stop there. '
  148: |-
    They are gathering an army. A heavily armed army. They certainly aren't
     going to just parade around. They intend to use it.
  149: |-
    So, by these actions they are taking, it is feasable that they will eventually
     come here?
  150: |-
    It is possible that they are already on their way here. The Brotherhood is
     the only real opposition they could have.
  151: |-
    I don't believe that shows hostility. They could simply be protecting themselves
     from attack. Even we have to deal with the occasional attack.
  152: "If they attack, it will be NOTHING like the occasional attack you get from\n
    the raiders. This will be a slaughter. "
  153: |-
    Since they are coming out of that old military installation, I would imagine
     that they would have weapons comparable to your own.
  154: What do you suggest? A preemptive strike at their military base?
  155: "Yes. I don't want them to know we are coming though.  A small team would\n
    stand a better chance of getting into their perimeter without being detected. "
  156: |-
    That will only take care of one part of the problem. They're being led by a
     group coming out of the Boneyard Cathedral.
  157: |-
    So be it. You shall have three Paladins of my choosing to meet you at the Military
     Base to help you get inside. Elders, thank you for your time. Best of luck to you Initiate.
  158: "If they are being led by a group out of the Boneyard Cathdral, then chances
    are\n they have a small army down there as well. "
  159: |-
    If we take them out in the north, then it leaves our south side vulnerable.
     I can only spare a few men on this endeavor.
  160: Give me a few Paladins to take out their base to the north.
  161: Give me a few Paladins to take out their base to the south.
  162: |-
    So be it. You shall have two Paladins of my choosing to meet you at the Boneyard
     Cathedral. Elders, thank you for your time. Best of luck to you Initiate.
  163: |-
    So be it. You shall have three Paladins of my choosing to meet you at the Military
     Base to help you get inside. Elders, thank you for your time. Best of luck to you Initiate.
  164: |-
    Obviously we made a mistake. Elders, I am sorry for wasting your time. Would someone
     please remove this mental abomination?
  165: I am too busy planning a defensive strategy.
  166: 'You gain '
  167: " experience points for convincing the Brotherhood to help."

PHIL:
  100: You see a peasant.
  101: You see Phil.
  102: It ain't my dog!
  103: Damn right, shoot that beast!
  104: I wouldn't trust that beast, if I was you. That thing is a killer.
  105: Mister,
  106: Ma'am,
  107: " I would be really happy if you were to get rid of that damn dog."
  108: Why?
  109: Nah, I only deal with important stuff.
  110: Where did it come from?
  111: Hnnn.
  112: Mebbe you can talk it to death.
  113: It won't let us back into our house, that's why.
  114: Okay.
  115: Isn't it your dog?
  116: |-
    It was the 'pet' of a traveller. When the traveller died, this
     damn dog just plopped its furry ass down on my doorstep
     and wouldn't leave. It's been there for days.
  117: Oh.
  118: Who was this traveller?
  119: What did the traveller look like?
  120: |-
    I don't know. Some guy. He came from the east, he said.
     Like anyone could get past the deadlands to the east.
     He ran afoul of Gizmo, trying to interfere with Gizmo's
     business.
  121: |-
    So, Gizmo had a couple of boys beat him up and throw him from
     the casino roof. The traveller broke his damnfool neck and
     died. The dog was pissed.
  122: What did the traveller look like?
  123: |-
    Oh, the guy was tall, dark-haired with a little graying
     around the edges. He was dressed all in black leather,
     like that's a good idea in the desert, and carried
     a shotgun.
  124: |-
    He had some funny accent. The dog was his constant companion,
     followed him everywhere.
  125: Appreciate the gossip.
  126: I hate that dog.
  127: Thanks for your help.
  128: Help us!
  129: We are being attacked!
  130: 'Thank you for helping us defend against those damn drunken raiders. For helping
    us we award you these '
  131: " caps."
  132: 'We thank you for your help! We pooled these '
  133: " caps together and award them to you for help in defending us against that
    scum."
MARCELLE:

  103: Nah, don't bother me.
  104: Hmm. I'll check it out.
  105: Dung!
  106: Oh, geez, I hope you can do it. He's in her room. Help her!
  107: You are an incredibly cold person. She could die without your help.
  108: Tough. That's life.
  109: All right, don't harp on me. I'll look into it.
  110: Help Sinthia. She's in trouble.
  111: |-
    Thank you for helping Sinthia. She's usually not a problem.
     You deserve a good night's sleep. On me. But don't ask
     for another freebie.
  112: Hnn. Thug.
  113: Thanks.
  114: 'No problem. Room #1. Follow me.'
  115: Enjoy your stay. Don't be a pain.
  116: |-
    You should have saved Sinthia. It's your fault she died. I
     hope you are happy with yourself.
  117: Yeah, whatever.
  118: Hnnn.
  119: Welcome to the Crash House. How can I help you, stranger?
  120: I'm looking for some water.

  123: Hnnn.
  124: |-
    Yeah, we serve your kind, too. It'll be $25 for the night.
     A week will cost you $150.
  125: Nah.
  126: Ahkay.
  127: Ahkay. Weeeka.
  128: Yeah, you too. Have a good day.
  129: |-
    Okay, thanks. Your room is room #1. Follow me. Don't be
     shooting any guns in here, okay?
  130: Have a good stay.
  131: You need some money before I can rent you a room.
  132: |-
    Then you should try the Skum Pitt. I heard you can get a lot
     of water in your booze there.
  133: |-
    I don't know about that, but I will rent you a room. It's a good place
     to rest and heal up. $25 for a day, or a week is $150. Most people go for
     the weekly rate. You should, if you ask me.
  134: Okay. A week.
  135: Just one night.
  136: No, thanks.
  137: I'm just a hotel manager, bub. Don't ask too much of me.
  138: Here's $50, tell me what you know.
  139: |-
    I know you're $50 poorer. I don't do the gossip thing, okay?
     Come back if you want a room.
  140: |-
    What do you think I am? A fool? If you're gonna bribe me,
     have enough money.
  141: Welcome back, what can I do for you?
  142: I want to rent a room.
  143: Hnnn.
  144: |-
    You're already renting room #1 from me. Do you want me to show
     you where it is?
  145: Sure.
  146: Nah.
  147: Yah.
  148: Nah.
  149: And this is still your room. Have a good stay.
  150: You know the drill. One day is $25. One week is $150.
  151: Nah.
  152: Da.
  153: Wee.
  154: Sure. It's $25 a day, or $150 for the entire week.
  155: Okay. A week.
  156: Just one night.
  157: No, thanks.
  158: 'Okay. Room #1 is yours. Have a nice stay.'
  159: Yeah, what do you want?
  160: I want to rent a room.
  161: Hnn.
  162: No. Go away.
  163: I don't like your face. I don't think I'll be renting you a room.
  164: I really need a place to stay.
  165: No. Have a good night.
  166: Okay. One night. $100.
  167: What! That's outrageous!
  168: Okay.
  169: Deal with it. Yes or no.
  170: No.
  171: Okay.
  172: |-
    Good. Here you go. Room #1. Have a nice night, check out
     time is 11 o' clock.
  173: You killed Killian, didn't you?
  174: Yep, sure did.
  175: Nah, wasn't me. Really it wasn't.
  176: Hnn.
  177: |-
    Get out! You're too dumb to realize what you did, but my
     life is hell now!
  178: |-
    You son of a bitch. I can't believe you killed him. He was
     a good man, and now I get all sorts of hell . . .
     get out, and don't come back.
  179: |-
    Yeah, whatever you say, but that's not what I heard.
     You'd better behave around here, or I'll get out ol' Betsy
     and ram some buckshot up your ass.
  180: It's late. I hope you aren't wasting my time.
  181: Hey! That fridge is for customers only!
  182: No thanks.
  183: Marcelles charges in to confront the raider!
  184: Uh, nothing. Never mind.
NGARFRDG:
  100: The fridge is locked.
  101: The fridge is already unlocked.
  102: You unlock the fridge.
  103: You haven't quite gotten this lock yet.
  104: Someone left the fridge open!
JTGENGRD:
  100: He looks like an experienced guardsman.
  101: You'd better watch yourself here.
  102: This isn't a good town to get in trouble in.
  103: Behave, and we won't have to get nasty.
  104: You're ok.
  105: Keep up the good work.
  106: Nice day, isn't it?
  107: |-
    This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on
     our good side.
  108: Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.
  109: I like my boss.
  110: |-
    You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we
     want to keep it that way.
  111: Put what away?
  112: Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.
  113: Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?
  114: Uh,oh.
  115: |-
    Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd
     better damn well keep them in your holster.
  116: Oh, sorry.
  117: No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!
  118: |-
    You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law.
     Put your weapon away, don't draw it unless in self-defense, and
     you won't have a problem with us guards. Disobey the law, and we
     will return you to the lawless wasteland - dead or alive.
  119: Sure, since you put it that way.
  120: Bite your laws!
  121: Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.
  122: |-
    Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If
     you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right
     to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just
     cause. Have a good day.
  123: |-
    Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on
     your head as a kid. No weapons.
  124: Hey! You! What are you doing sneaking around?
  125: Nothing.
  126: I'm not sneaking around. I just like to walk cautiously.
  127: Uhhh.
  128: Whatever you're doing, don't do it in this town.
  129: |-
    The guard stares at you for a moment. You see a look of recognition
     on his face, and then he pulls his weapon.
  130: Well, uh, ok. Whatever. Just don't do anything out of line.
  131: Thanks, bye.
  132: Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, sir.
  133: Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, ma'am.
  134: Put that weapon away, or face the consequences!
  135: |-
    Okay, that's enough warnings. Leave town, now, and never return, or
     face the consequences!
  136: Hey! What do you think you're doing?
  137: That's it, you've had it, buddy.
  138: You're in trouble now . . .
  139: You Skulz are under arrest!
GHGUARD:
  100: You see a ghoul guard.
  101: |-
    We're going to take you to Set. I think he'll want to talk to you,
     personally.
  102: You shouldn't be here . . .
  103: |-
    Garret told me it was OK. He told me to get something from Set's
     room for him. Do you know where it is?
  104: OK. I'll just be leaving then.
  105: Huh?
  106: That doesn't sound right. You'd better come along with me.
  107: I don't think so.
  108: OK.
  109: I don't think you want to go to that room.
  110: Why not?
  111: Ok, I don't want to go into that room. Now what?
  112: I think you'd better be leaving.
  113: |-
    We are here to make sure that people that don't belong in Set's room
     don't go into it. Not for Set's safety, actually, but for theirs.
     Anything else?
  114: Yeah. Your shoelaces are untied.
  115: Nah. Thanks.
  116: I'm on duty. Go away.
TERRY:
  100: You see Terry.
  101: |-
    The water ration is passed out at night . . . Hey, you're not
     a ghoul!
  102: |-
    That's not important right now. What is important
     is the location of the boss.
  103: No, I'm not.
  104: Ngh.
  105: I'll take you to him. Here, let me give you a hand.
  106: I'd better take you to Harry, he'll know what to do with you.
  107: Hey, no talking! It disturbs my thinking.
  108: What time of night is it?
  109: The mutant ignores you.
  1000: Chip
  1001: Necropolis
  1002: Set
  1003: Watershed
  1004: Hall
  1005: Lou
  1006: Ghouls
  1007: Normals
  1100: I dunno.
  1101: Yer standin in it.
  1102: He's a wus. We should just wipe out him and his ghouls.
  1103: That's here.
  1104: I dunno.
  1105: He Harry's boss.
  1106: Wimpy things.
  1107: Wimpier than ghouls.
PATRICK:
  100: |-
    You see a man in studded leather armor with an odd assortment of
     knick-knacks.
  101: You see Patrick, the Celt.
  102: Greetings, traveler. What brings you out this far?
  103: Just wandering.
  104: Um, why are you carrying all that junk?
  105: I need to find a water purification control chip.
  106: I'm killing everybody I can get within shooting distance of. Prepare to die.
  107: Lub!
  108: I see. Much like myself, then.
  109: Oh? You're not from one of the communities out here?
  110: Can you direct me to a nearby settlement?
  111: So what's your story?
  112: Well, see ya.
  113: It's not junk! It's trade goods!
  114: Uh, right. Bye.
  115: Uh huh. So what's your story?
  116: Hmm. Haven't seen one of those before. What seems to be the trouble?
  117: This chip controls water purification for my Vault. It's blown out, though.
  118: It's broken.
  119: |-
    I wander from place to place, making a living with music and a little bit
     of tinkering work.
  120: What kind of work do you do?
  121: What kind of music do you sing?
  122: Well, it's good to meet you. Bye.
  123: |-
    Using the coastline as a referent, you've got Shady Sands about a week
     inland, and Junktown a few days south of there. Hub's just another couple days
     south of Junktown. Avoid Necropolis to the east of those, though. Not worth
     the trouble.
  124: What do you know about Shady Sands?
  125: What do you know about Junktown?
  126: What do you know about the Hub?
  127: What do you know about Necropolis?
  128: |-
    I don't think I could help you with that. I never had much of a chance to
     study pre-war Vault technology.
  129: |-
    Mostly a little electrical and mechanical tinkering. I helped Junktown with
     their lights and showed the people in Shady Sands a better design for their
     stoves.
  130: Really? Think you could fix a water chip?
  131: Oh, mostly old folk songs and some Celtic music. It's a change of pace.
  132: Would you happen to know "Na Gheala Mbeadh", as I think it's called?
  133: I see. What else do you do?
  134: |-
    Shady Sands is a small, self-sufficient community led by Aradesh, a kind
     man and strong leader. They are peaceful and hard-working. They are probably the
     best chance for a new civilization here.
  135: |-
    Shady Sands is a small farming community. They were led by a good man
     named Aradesh, but I've heard he's gone. It's a pity. Without him I don't know
     if they'll survive.
  136: |-
    Junktown? A small trading city. Strange place until you get used to it.
     They are run by mayor Killian Darkwater, a hard but fair man.
  137: |-
    Junktown? A small trading city. Strange place until you get used to it.
     They are run by Gizmo, a gambling mogul and crime-lord.
  138: Junktown? A small trading city. Not too remarkable.
  139: |-
    The Hub is a major trading center. It's said that you can find anything
     there, and I'd say that's not too far wrong.
  140: |-
    Necropolis is the city of the dead. It's inhabited by ghouls, the
     descendants of humans who sought shelter in a Vault there. Story goes that the
     Vault failed somehow, so now the only inhabitants are carrion-eating monsters.
  141: |-
    It was overrun by an army of mutants last I heard. I'd stay away from
     there, if I were you.
  142: Do you suppose that Vault might have parts that I could salvage?
  143: |-
    Possibly, but I for one wouldn't risk the ghouls. Latest word is they've
     some sort of powerful new leader.
  144: Why, certainly. Would you like to hear it?
  145: Sure.
  146: Nah.
  147: |-
    [Patrick sings songs and the two of you reminisce for several hours. You
     feel invigorated.]
  148: Hello again. Can I help you?
  149: Yeah, can you give me some directions?
  150: No, never mind, thanks.
SMELL:
  100: You smell something rank ahead.
MACHIV:
  100: Before you is a Mach IV Computer.
  101: It seems as though the system is in a reboot status.
  102: The system seems to have locked up.
  103: The monitor flickers.
  104: The screen is showing odd color patterns.
CHAIR:
  100: This is no time to sit down! Get moving!
SET:
  100: You see Set, the Leader of Necropolis.
  101: |-
    There'd better be a killer reason for standin' in my
     shadow. Does 'next on the menu' ring a bell for ya . . .
     normie.
  102: |-
    Oh, killer it is, no doubt. Obviously I've found the
     head, uh, man.
  103: Whoa, what happened to your face?
  104: Wow, you're pretty smart for a ghoul.
  105: Nuh-uh?
  106: Simple time. I'm Set. I'm in charge. Get it?
  107: According to my info you're just a second rate minion.
  108: 'Got it. '
  109: Anything else I should know?
  110: Good.
  111: What can I do for you?
  112: |-
    What is that? Sucking up? Listen, walker, I don't do
     the deal with norms, so blowing smoke up the tail
     ain't going to get you head seat at the table.
  113: |-
    The smoke will be coming out a lotta holes when I'm
     through.
  114: My apologies. I wanted to make a good impression.
  115: Didn't mean nothin'.
  116: |-
    [Groan] I'm gonna to eat you up and be singing that 'Happy Tummy'
     song. I got that happy tummy . . .
  117: Fact-time, bitch? I'm gonna enjoy squeezing you.
  118: |-
    Whatever's in your holster better be bigger than your
     mouth . . . Unlikely as that is.
  119: Squeeze this...
  120: Nuh-uh?
  121: |-
    Well. I see some potential here . . . heh . . . I have playmates
     for you, my sparkling normie. Punish the mutants at the water shed for me.
     Yeah, yeah, can do . . . yes?
  122: Uh, OK.
  123: Nuh-uh.
  124: |-
    Excellent. Teach those mutants the last lesson, then
     amble back . . . Hmm. If I say to my ghouls to hold
     off you, the muties might hear and know. So I tell you what,
     it's favor-time. I keep shut. Got it?
  125: Got it.
  126: What about the ghouls?
  127: Duh, ok!
  128: Huh?
  129: |-
    Avoid my ghouls, if you like your skin on. Any of mine that can't
     stop a normie deserve last rest. Get by as you need.
  130: You eat my time! Cease to be, one way or the other!
  131: You have no idea whose shadow you stomp.
  132: A second-rate minion. I know your boss. Not happy.
  133: Neither do you.
  134: Sorry, I have an odd sense of humor.
  135: |-
    You walk for him? You're his sneak, straight? Here to skin me?
     Oh, I swear, you'll tombstone too.
  136: Whoa, Don't misinterpret. I'm not his. I'm here to help.
  137: Try it spaghetti face.
  138: It didn't sound it.
  139: I understand. He's my problem, too. Talk to me.
  140: |-
    The Necropolis was mine. Not an all-things-great,
     but a straight-place for my kind. Then the Master
     showed. He could've fragged me good, but it was easy
     for him to just stand some muties and keep an eye on.
  141: What can I do, and what will you do for me?
  142: Sounds a bit out of my league. I'm outta this.
  143: |-
    The Mutants at the water shed need dirt-naps. Makes
     my shadow grow. You slice 'em and rewards run to
     you. Info, too.
  144: Done.
  145: Too much trouble. See ya around.
  146: |-
    You want employ, walker? Show me you can scuffle.
     Take down the mutants at the water shed. Show 'em
     the bad time and you're good.
  147: I'm on it.
  148: No way, spaghetti face.
  149: 'No. More questions? '
  150: Ahhh, guess not. What can I do for you?
  151: Yeah. Do find it difficult to floss?
  152: |-
    So funny my face hurts. Try again, and my Elites will
     juice you. Got it?
  153: Got it.
  154: I'm still a little unclear . . .
  155: Your face hurts alright.
  156: |-
    My name's Set. Yours is World-a-hurt. Take a deal, I
     change your handle. Listening?
  157: Sure. Beats bleeding all over your floor.
  158: Naww. Bring on the goons.
  159: Uh-huh.
  160: Nuh-uh!
  161: |-
    Stride to the water shed, dirt-nap the mutants there.
     Do it, you continue a walker. Don't, you rest.
  162: |-
    You sound a little scared by these guys, want to
     talk about it?
  163: I'm easy. Deal.
  164: You look funny, and you talk funny.
  165: |-
    Well done. You've earned my sight, walker. Follow
     Garret for your reward. Now. I'm busy.
  166: OK. Thanks.
  167: That's it! Thanks, now get out?
  168: Mom?
  169: |-
    Look before you squeak. You'll enjoy. Be a shame to
     anger me, now . . . that I'm happy.
  170: |-
    I apologize for my outburst, but I'm a little concerned
     here.
  171: Sorry, no problem.
  172: Hey, I'm not settling for left-overs
  173: |-
    [Groan] Yeah, yeah. Follow Garret, and be showing your pearly whites too.
     And don't fret, I keep a straight-word. The Master runs the twist.
  174: The Master?
  175: Ok, thanks.
  176: |-
    You don't watch your back, you'll wear his knife, he'll wear your
     skin. His mutants shadow the wasteland, especially south of here.
  177: If the Master is so strong, who can challenge him?
  178: He doesn't scare me.
  179: He should.
  180: |-
    Children of the Cathedral, cids of the Hub, even
     us Ghouls. No one can push his shadow now. But our
     light will be brighter next time. Ho-ho, yes.
  181: Good luck.
  182: Follow Garret and get out.
  183: Right.
  184: Frag off.
  185: |-
    You can be left-overs. Leave now, without your
     reward, or you're on the table tonight.
  186: If that's the way you want it.
  187: Frag off.
  188: |-
    No word runs to my ear about the water shed
     mutants ceasing to breathe. Major to my plans. Tell
     me it's a problem buried.
  189: |-
    Oh, yeah. No big deal, everything's been taken care of.
     Trust me.
  190: Nope, still working on it.
  191: Nuh-uh.
  192: 'Ahhh, filling. Follow Garret to your reward. '
  193: "You steal my time with your lies. Leave my\n shadow before . . . die. Die!
    Just die! "
  194: |-
    Walk now. Deal with the mutants, and then
     return. Not before.
  195: |-
    Caught by mine, huh? I gave you the straight
     on them. Now you pay. No credit.
  196: I am Set. Why do you tread my shadow?
  197: |-
    I am the bringer of death. Fall to your knees and beg
     for mercy.
  198: |-
    I am the bringer of death. Fall to your knees and beg
     for mercy . . . Or give me a sandwich, I'm pretty hungry.
  199: I'm here to see the boss. That you?
  200: Whoa, major case of acne!
  201: Uhh, ahdunno.
  202: |-
    Normies. If you caused the trembles in me,
     would my gates be this open?
  203: |-
    I've killed ghouls. I've killed mutants. I've killed
     things that you couldn't even imagine. Nobody gets in
     my way.
  204: How about a face lift . . . It'll look good on my wall.
  205: |-
    You topped those at the watershed. I find that
     filling. For that, I'll give words. Then we walk
     opposite.
  206: Why don't we just 'walk opposite' now?
  207: Works for me.
  208: |-
    A warn. The South makes a big dog whimper and
     tuck tail. If ideas dance in your skull, I make
     big dogs play dead. On the other, you clean-wiped
     the shed. Garret will walk you to gratitude.
  209: |-
    Laughter comes hard here. You clean-wiped the
     shed?
  210: That's the fact.
  211: Oh, no. Wasn't me.
  212: |-
    My wrong, your loss. Work grows, you should walk
     now.
  213: |-
    Ah, yes. No tracks in the sand. Good. Filling. Walk
     with Garret to gratitude.
  214: 'I cast the shadow. If that''s the lot, remove yourself. '
  215: I'm here to collect the bounty for some mutants.
  216: Thanks, I think I will be going.
  217: It'd be faster if I removed you.
  218: |-
    Workable. Follow Garret to gratitude, then walk
     another path.
  219: |-
    Reasons for aggressions? Walk and mine will stand.
     Talk and mine will move.
  220: Sorry, bad attempt at humor.
  221: "'Bout time. Getting bored waiting for your face to clear up."
  222: |-
    Ahh, the thinker-normie. You killed those at the
     shed, yes? Came for reward?
  223: Uh-huh
  224: Nuh-uh, me came kick ugly-butt.
  225: 'Now is bad. Walk. '
  226: I deserve some information.
  227: How about I walk on your face?
  228: Got it.
  229: Nuh-uh?
  230: Fine. Fast. What?
  231: |-
    You wouldn't do the mutants yourself. I ask myself
     why? Answer, someone has you scared. Why?
  232: |-
    Why'd you need me to kill the mutants? Why not use
     your ghouls?
  233: How in the hell can you call all this crap a reward?
  234: |-
    I don't tremble. Use the tools of the time. You're
     used, you're rewarded, you're walking.
  235: You're bluffing.
  236: If you say so.
  237: I think that's a threat!
  238: |-
    You don't even read the lines. Unless Necropolis
     is forever your home to be, walk. I have no time for a
     foolish blood-bag.
  239: How 'bout your own body-bag?
  240: Got it.
  241: Bite me.
  242: With pleasure . . .
  243: |-
    No bluff, no twist. The Master does not tremble
     me. Walk. Your welcome has.
  244: Thanks for your time.
  245: |-
    Think smokin' you will bring back my welcome?
     Works for me.
  246: |-
    Why send a ghoul for a child's work?
     Leave me.
  247: I'm weary. You're gone.
  248: Sow and weep! I want you dead! Dead!
  249: |-
    I spy your twist and it causes one of us pain.
     Short-list choice: Remove the mutants or die.
  250: I'll get right to it.
  251: |-
    It's a bigger list. #3 is: What if I twist off
     your head instead?
  252: |-
    Still in my shadow? Why do normie tongues waggle
     and take the movement from their bones? Clear-time, walk now.
  253: Your presence means?
  254: |-
    Not much, just spreading the news that the Master
     is dead.
  255: Ran out of butt to kick and thought of your face.
  256: Huh. Master go boom.
  257: You mean dead?
  258: Uh-huh.
  259: |-
    Warm. Filling. Your needs are my desires. Name
     them.
  260: Need some info on the Vats.
  261: I could use some more weapons and equipment.
  262: No Thanks.
  263: Need stuff.
  264: Naww.
  265: |-
    Some of mine slipped the bonds. Worked that
     mutant task.
  266: What did they say?
  267: Mutants, huh? I'll probably need more guns.
  268: |-
    Big northwest, far from life. Busy with guards
     and tricky steering. If that's your path, walk it tight with my thoughts.
  269: Garret will pass what's available.
  270: |-
    You. Vanished our water processor chip. Exchanged
     it . . . for your life!
  271: |-
    We both need working chips. Apparently there is only
     one. Is there another method we haven't thought about?
  272: I needed the chip to save my own vault. Sorry.
  273: Will sorry do?
  274: Want it back?
  275: Uhh?
  276: |-
    A path, perhaps. An alternate pump exists, but not
     its actions. None of mine can breathe that life.
  277: Perhaps I should take a look at the pump.
  278: Too bad. Guess you're going thirsty.
  279: |-
    Garret will walk you. Revive the pump, keep the
     chip.
  280: Thanks.
  281: I'll drink from you warm, then take from you cold.
  282: I don't have it on me.
  283: How 'bout eating dirt instead.
  284: Then die before mine!
  285: Ideas will not matter to you again.
  286: I take it that's a 'no?'
  287: Your price is to belong to Necropolis forever.
  288: |-
    Kind of expensive. How 'bout I remove you from office
     instead?
  289: Nuh-uh!
  290: For the chip, you may walk.
  291: Gotcha! I don't have it anymore!
  292: OK, here it is.
  293: I'd rather see you dead.
  294: |-
    [Set passes the water chip to a ghoul, who runs
     off with it.]  If your shadow touches Necropolis again, it will
     merge forever.
  295: As said . . .
  296: Stated before . . .
  297: Don't do the deal with normies.
  298: Natter to Garret. My time flies.
  299: Is your head empty?
  300: Yours is the only benefit. This exchange lacks.
  301: Thoughts not in my possession
  302: The time is wrong. Evening is proper for your shadow.

  304: Guards, end this annoyance!

FRUIT:

    Although the fruit here appears abnormal, you recognize it
     and recall that it has healing properties.
GARL:
  100: You see before you, Garl, leader of the Raiders.
  101: |-
    You think you can come here without challenge?
     This, the home of your deadliest enemies? We will
     see you dead. I will personally tear your heart
     out of your chest and eat it before my proud
     warriors!
  102: I killed you!
  103: I don't get it.
  104: Yes, you did. I've come back to haunt you.
  105: You should not have done that.
  106: I killed you!
  107: I don't get it.
  108: Yes, you did. I've come back to haunt you.
  109: You should not have done that.
  110: |-
    You would if you were my father, but you are not.
     You look like he did, but act different. No image
     of him remains to this day. You will just have to
     be removed.
  111: I don't believe it! I can't believe it!
  112: Believe this buddy, and you're about to join me in Hell!
  113: |-
    Don't tell me what I should have done, father. I rule the
     Khans now, and you are but worm meat.
  114: I still live.
  115: I should have killed you when you were a child.
  116: |-
    Don't tell me what I should have done, father. I rule the

  117: I still live.
  118: I should have killed you when you were a child.
  119: |-
    You should have. Now it's too late. I am Garl Death-Hand.
     I rule the Khans. You should be dead in your grave, and
     you will be again!
  120: |-
    I can see you standing before me, but I don't believe
     it. What do you want?
  121: I want the girl set free. Now.
  122: I want you to step down.
  123: I want riches to buy my way into Heaven.
  124: |-
    Pledge that you shall return to the grave, and it shall
     be so.
  125: I swear that I will leave.
  126: |-
    So be it. Release the Shady Sands woman and escort
     this one out of here . . .
  127: |-
    You don't rule here. You don't belong here. Death
     to the walking dead!
  128: Never!
  129: |-
    That's what I like. Initiative. But you should not have
     killed them without my orders. I don't like too much
     initiative.
  130: What do you want?
  131: I want you to set the girl free.
  132: I want you to die.
  133: I've come in peace to negotiate the release of Tandi.
  134: Hngh!
  135: What makes you think I have her?
  136: I know you do. I followed you here.
  137: One of your followers told me.
  138: I know.
  139: |-
    I hate it when they do that. I will have to make that
     loudmouth pay for his crimes. After I finish up with you.
  140: Hmmm. Well, then. What do you offer for her release?
  141: |-
    I represent a threat you don't even understand. Do you really
     want to risk our wrath.
  142: I will give you something of equal value.
  143: It would be good for your eternal soul.
  144: Your blood, spilled on the ground.
  145: |-
    Hmmm. For some reason, I believe you. You may take the
     girl, but do not return unless you seek our wrath.
  146: Ha! You should not threaten your betters.
  147: It must be valuable indeed. Show me.
  148: It pleases me. You may take the girl, but do not return.
  149: Your bribe is not worth my time. Kill him.
  150: |-
    You think a man such as I believes in the afterlife?
     This world is dying, and I shall take what I want!
     You will never realize the strength required to make
     such a decision!
  151: What do you want now?
  152: Nothing.
  153: I want the girl.
  154: Lorrk.
  155: Then you disturb me. Leave.
  156: |-
    You are barely tolerated by us. Why should we give
     one of our most prized possessions to you?
  157: It is only right.
  158: I have something of equal value.
  159: You will be allowed to live.
  160: |-
    Right?! I determine what is right around here. You
     are treading on dangerous ground.
  161: I'm sorry.
  162: Why should I care? I'm taking the girl.
  163: |-
    Yes, indeed you are. I don't tolerate frightened
     curs that have no backbone. And what we don't
     tolerate, we destroy. Kill him.
  164: Would you be willing to fight me over her?
  165: No, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
  166: Of course. Right now, just you and me.
  167: I'll take you and your whole gang on.
  168: |-
    Fine. We shall settle this with no weapons. Knock me
     out, and I'll let you take the woman and leave. I
     knock you out, you leave without her.
  169: Fine.
  170: |-
    This will be interesting, but not very sporting.
     Very well, let's do it.
  171: OK.
  172: |-
    Hmm, you fight better then I expected. I haven't
     had a good beating since my father slapped me
     around the room. You deserve the Shady Sands
     woman. Take her and leave. I wouldn't come back.
  173: |-
    Take your miserable hide and leave. If you ever
     return, I will not be so gentle.
  174: What do you want?
  175: I'm an explorer.
  176: I want to join.
  177: |-
    We don't like those kind of people. We can't have that
     here. Kill him.
  178: You? Want to join us? Whatever for?
  179: To kick some serious ass.
  180: I like you guys. I want to bond with you.
  181: |-
    The Raiders only accept the meanest and toughest SOBs
     around. You have to be bloodthirsty, violent, extreme.
     I don't think you can handle that. Can you?
  182: Yes.
  183: No.
  184: Then you had better leave. I would not return.
  185: I grow tired of these women. Kill them.
  186: No!
  187: OK.
  188: |-
    You have proved my point. Only the Raiders posses
     the will to survive! You do not. Kill him.
  189: |-
    You have proved my point. Only the Raiders posses
     the will to survive! You do not. Kill her.
  190: Scum! You will pay for that!
  191: |-
    Ha! I like your style. A little sloppy, but it works.
     Consider yourself a friend of the Raiders. Leave my
     sight now.
  192: What do you want now?
  193: Nothing.
  194: I want some weapons and armor.
  195: Grawp.
  196: You must fend for yourself.
  197: How dare you return to my sight? Kill him!
  198: How dare you return to my sight? Kill her!
  200: I came to party with you guys!
  201: Well go get some more booze and women for our party.
  203: I'll fight you one-on-one for Tandi.
  204: You're no Raider, you deserve no honor.
  205: Your bribe is not worth my time. Kill her.
  206: |-
    We don't like those kind of people. We can't have that
     here. Kill her.
  207: Waaaug!
  208: Ok, you win. Take the girl and get out of here.

     a hard day pillaging.
  1103: Miserable little piss ant community. I could crush them.

    They are to the south.  We trade with them.  Mostly for
     water and ammo, but sometimes for weapons.
  1105: Why should I care?

  1107: Miserable little piss ant community. I could crush them.

  102: These caravan trips are getting too dangerous.
  103: Hey, you got any smokes?
  104: I need a bath.

  101: Ok, Ok, I've got your money.
  102: I've got more expenses.  I need to increase the payment.
  103: Screw this.  I want ALL of your money now, or you're a dead Bob.
  104: I can't take the heat.  I'm calling off the payments.
  105: I want information on Decker.
  106: I want information on Doc Morbid.
  107: Gimme' an iguana on a stick.
  108: I'm sorry.  I ain't payin' no more.  Do what you want with me.
  109: |-
    Bob, I thought we were pals!  In fact, I was thinking about giving you a promotion in my
     organization.  Instead, you betray me.  This is very disappointing...
  110: Bob, why should I take no for an answer?  Especially from a scumbag like you?
  111: Glad to see you're standing up for yourself.
  112: Your reputation is history, Bob.  Hi-sto-ree!
  113: Fine, I'll decide what to do with you later.
  114: Well, it was nice knowing you Bob.  Say 'hi' to Satan for me.
  115: What are you doing back so soon?  It ain't time for the payment.
  116: You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here.  Get lost!
  117: Hey, I don't want any trouble!
  118: Hi!  Welcome to Bob's Iguana Bits, the family eating place.  Can I take your
    order?
  119: Forget it.
  120: You are?  Well, Ok...
  121: He's a mean son of a bitch.  You don't want to mess with him.  Anything else?
  122: Fine.  What do you want me to pay?
  123: 'I want '
  124: " bucks every five days."
  125: |-
    Doc Morbid?  All I know is that he's up around Junktown and he's the cheapest source of
     food I could find.  That's all!
  126: Let's see what I've got in stock.
  127: I've got a whole iguana for twenty caps.
  128: I've got prime cut choice for eight caps.
  129: I'll take one of the real ones.
  130: Nothing for me right now.  I'm on a diet.
  131: I'll take one of the prime cuts.
  132: I could go for some prime cut right now.  I'll even pay for it.
  133: Uhh... Me no hungry now.
  134: Fine!  Take your money and get out!
  135: You can stick it!  I ain't ever payin' you!  Get lost!
  136: Yeah, sure.  Why don't you find someone else to screw over.
  137: You can't throw crap without getting some of it on your fingers.  Get out of
    here!
  138: Sure you will.  Get lost!
  139: Sorry.  We're all out of iguana.
  140: We only have whole iguana on a stick.  Twenty bucks each.
  141: We only have prime select choice.  It tastes great, though.  Eight bucks each.
  142: Sure.  We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime select
    pieces for eight bucks.
  143: I'll take a whole iguana.
  144: I'll take your prime select.
  145: You know, I hear your prime select tastes like chicken.  Do you like eating
    cowardly guys?
  146: No sissy portions!  Me want all iguana!  Ugh!
  147: Hmm, smell good!  Me want prime!
  148: Never seen any of them around here.  Water Merchants don't need 'em.
  149: Water Merchants?
  150: Mr. Decker is a distinguished businessman in a less than distinguished business.  Anything
    else?
  151: "[]"
  152: What kind of business?
  153: What are you talking about?
  154: |-
    Your secret ingredients.  How fresh does the corpse have to be before it develops a bitter
     aftertaste?  Do you use mutants, humans, or a mix?
  155: I found an invoice in Doc Morbid's lair.  An invoice for dead bodies...
  156: If you've got a memory loss, I can talk to the sheriff.
  157: Prime Choice Select is made of people!!!!  It's made of people!!!
  158: Nothing.  Sorry to bring it up.  Now is there anything else I can do for you?
  159: Well, he's dead now, and my cash flow has increased because of it.
  160: Someone killed Decker.  We're in mourning. [snicker]
  161: Someone shot Sheriff Greene.  Don't know about the deputy, though.
  162: Daren Hightower was murdered.  And all that money couldn't save him.  Ironic,
    ain't it?
  163: Someone stole a necklace from the Hightowers.  Man, did they ever make a big
    mistake.  They're dead for sure!
  164: Someone killed Jain over at the Cathedral.  I hear she was a real pain in the
    butt!
  165: |-
    Well, the only new thing is that the Children of the Cathedral has taken over the Hospital.  It's
     pretty boring around here lately.
  166: Anything else?
  167: Man, I'm gonna be out of business in a week.  Anything else, oh high and mighty?
  168: I don't like your attitude.
  169: Sorry, you can't afford it.
  170: One whole iguana coming up!  Anything else?
  171: You know what they're made from and you still want one?  You make Decker look
    like a charity worker!  Anything else?
  172: I don't like your attitude.
  173: Sorry, you can't afford it.
  174: One iguana prime select choice, coming up!  Anything else?
  175: Smart choice.  You could stand to lose a few pounds.
  176: Wh...what!  Oh, I see, you're joking...
  177: Of course I am...
  178: No, I'm not.  I'm going to see that you pay for your crime.
  179: No, I'm not.  And I want a piece of the action.
  180: |-
    You must be new in town if you're asking me about the Water Merchants.  Water is life, and you
     don't get much more powerful than life and death.
  181: Who's in charge of the Water Merchants?
  182: |-
    If there's anything that involves misery and suffering in the Hub, Decker either controls it or
     wants to control it.  Anything else?
  183: |-
    I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't appreciate your slander!  I suggest you don't
     show your face in here again.
  184: |-
    Don't do that!  Fine, I've been using some questionable portions.  But it's not like I'm
     committing murder.  Doc Morbid's stuff is already dead, isn't it?
  185: I'm sure it is, Bob.  Have a nice day...
  186: Cannibalism is a crime against humanity, Bob.  I'm going to see that you pay
    for it.
  187: Maybe it is.  Maybe it isn't.  I don't care.  I want a piece of the action.
  188: Not so loud!  I don't need you saying that all over the Hub...
  189: I guess I was rude.  Have a nice day...
  190: You know, the police station is just across the street.  I really should take
    a little walk.
  191: I can get even louder.  But I can also shut up.  Noise is cheap, silence is
    expensive.
  192: |-
    How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock?  Fine!  Have another iguana!  I hope
     you choke on it!
  193: I don't like your attitude.
  194: |-
    Tough.  You want money, I'll give it to you.  You want food, I'll give it to you.  You want to
     die, I'll arrange it.  But "like" ain't part of the equation.
  195: Nothing I can think of.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run.
  196: Sorry, we're all out of iguana.
  197: We only have whole iguana on a stick.  Twenty bucks.
  198: We only have prime select choice.  Eight bucks.
  199: |-
    Again?  Man you must be hungry.  We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our
     prime select pieces for eight bucks.
  200: I'll take a whole iguana.
  201: I'll take your prime select.
  202: You know, I hear your prime select tastes like chicken.  Do you like eating
    cowardly guys?
  203: No sissy portions!  Me want all iguana!  Ugh!
  204: Hmm, smell good!  Me want prime!

    How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock?  Fine!  Have another iguana!  I hope you
     choke on it!
  206: I don't like your attitude.
  207: Uh, bye.
  208: Wait a minute.  We've got to find a way to reach a mutual understanding!
  209: The only way you'll be able to keep me quiet is to kill me.
  210: Sorry, no deal.
  211: Fine.  What can I get out of this?
  212: Fine.  What do you want me to pay?
  213: 'I want '
  214: '50'
  215: '75'
  216: '100'
  217: '150'
  218: '200'
  219: " bucks every five days."
  220: I don't think I'll blackmail you.  Carry on.
  221: I'd change your mind if I were you, friend.  People have died for less in the
    Hub.
  222: 'Fine.  It''s a deal. '
  223: " bucks, due every five days.  I guess I'll see you in five..."
  224: No way I'm going for that.  I can't afford more than what I'm paying you now.
  225: Too bad, Bob.  I'd hate to start singing.
  226: Fine.  We'll stay with the current arrangement... for now.
  227: Can you afford a funeral, Bob?
  228: Fine.  Maybe it would be good if our paths didn't cross again.
  229: |-
    You may be a songbird, but I'm the golden goose.  You ain't gonna sing, not when I'm the only
     goose you've got.  Now get out!
  230: First sensible thing I remember you saying.  Now get out!
  231: Gimme' an iguana on a stick.
  232: What can you tell me about a Water Chip?
  233: What can you tell me about Decker?
  234: I think we need to talk about Doc Morbid and some of your secret ingredients.
  235: Do you know anything about the missing caravans?
  236: What, me trouble?  What gives you that impression?
  237: Anything interesting happening in the Hub?
  238: Me hungry!  Grrrrr!
  239: |-
    Terrible business.  Those poor people.  Oh, those poor people.  Losing their lives in such a ghastly
     way!  Is there anything else I can do for you?  Like feed you, perhaps?
  240: Nothing, bye.
  241: Me go now.
BVAIRL:
  100: |-
    You notice that there is a wall locker on the east wall,
     just like in your own vault.
ISMARC:
  100: You see a thin, angry-looking man.
  101: You see Ismarc.
  102: What?
  103: Yeah, what do you want?
  104: Hey, good singing.
  105: Your singing makes my ears bleed.
  106: Never mind.
  107: Hoo!
  108: Oh, great. You don't know how gratified that makes me. Go away.
  109: Thanks. What can I do for ya?
  110: Do you do music anywhere else?
  111: Just felt like tossing some money in the hat, so to speak.
  112: Where did you learn to sing?
  113: Thanks for your time.
  114: What?!? I don't have time for this.
  115: |-
    Yeah, I sing at the Hub sometimes, and I've visited the Brotherhood of
     Steel and Adytum with the caravans. Why do you ask?
  116: Can you tell me how to get to the Hub?
  117: I need to know how to get to the Brotherhood.
  118: How do I get to Adytum?
  119: Um, never mind, thanks.
  120: The Hub? Oh, it's just a short distance down south of Junktown. What else?
  121: |-
    The Brotherhood is a couple days west and a little bit north of here.
     Don't go there, though. They won't let you in unless you're with a caravan.
     You need anything else?
  122: |-
    Hmm. Head southwest of the Hub. Adytum is part of the Boneyard. It's a
     small, semi-industrial town. I didn't like it much there. What else do you want?
  123: |-
    Hey, thanks. It's hard being a starving artist. You got anything you
     need to know, you just ask.
  124: I appreciate the thought and all, but you're strapped worse than I am.
  125: |-
    Ah, I picked it up here and there. Learned a little from an old singer
     at the Hub, and got some music from the scavs in Adytum, in the Boneyard. You
     know. Just takes some practice.
  126: There is a man singing raucously in the corner.
  127: Your head is a bowl!
  128: It's round like a mole!
  129: I'd rather fry!
  130: Than pay you the toll!
  131: I know your mind
  132: It's a steel cage
  133: Raging inside is . . .
  134: The DeathClaw
  135: I need you
  136: Like a bad dose of poison
  137: I need you
  138: Like a rad scorpion strike
GLWALIEN:
  100: A frozen corpse.
  101: This is definitely not of terrestrial origin.
  102: This body might be some kind of genetic experiment.
  103: What? It's a dead body.
  104: This frozen body looks odd.
SCSUPMUT:
  100: You see a scout for the Nightkin.
  101: What have we here? A normal. I think you will come with me.
  102: Nu.
  103: Okay.
  104: Why should I?
  105: Think again!
  106: It is really quite simple. If you come with me, I can help you.
  107: Ok. I will go with you.
  108: Just point me to the leader instead.
  109: No way!
  110: With the quickest of haste. Look for Uthern. He will set you straight.
  111: Uthern wants to see you. Seems he's heard of you.
MUTANT2:
  100: |-
    It's some kind of huge super mutant creature!
     And it has a very large gun!
  101: Take him to Harry. He'll know what to do with him.
  102: We should take her to Harry. He has plans for all the women.
GENRAIDR:
  100: The Raider is too frightened of Garl to speak to you anymore.
  101: You see a tough desert Raider.
  102: It's the Death-Hand. He's returned!
  103: Excuse me, Death-Hand. I'm sorry to disturb you.
  104: Have you come back to kill your son?
  105: Aiyeee! A ghost!
  106: The dead walk again! The Death-Hand has returned!
  107: Well met.
  108: Hi.
  109: I'm waiting for Garl to crush Shady Sands. I want some loot.
  110: Welcome, friend.
  111: I'm glad that you could return for a visit.
  112: Unless you want trouble, you'd better put that away.
  113: Do you want to party? If not, put your weapon away.
  114: Oh, a tough one, huh?
  115: Garl Death-Hand loves his warriors. Put that thing away and go talk to him.
  116: So, you think you're tough, huh? Mess with me and we'll both find out.
  117: I don't like your looks.
  118: Go away!
  119: What do you want?
  120: I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Seen her?
  121: Nothing. Just looking around.
  122: Huh?
  123: |-
    Oh. You must be looking for a job. Go and see Garl in the big room
     and leave us alone.
  124: Then do it elsewhere.
  125: Nah. I ain't seen her. Why are you asking?
  126: Nothing. Just looking for a friend of mine.
  127: There is a bounty on her head. If I can kill her, I can get some good cash.
  128: You're lying. Where is she?
  129: Ah, OK.
  130: Really? What does she look like?
  131: About 6 feet tall. Blonde. She's from Shady Sands.
  132: |-
    Yeah, she's here. She's in the big house. You know, if we tell Garl,
     then he would want a piece of the bounty. You might want to think about that.
  133: |-
    You don't sound like you mean it. I think that you are up to something.
     And if you are telling the truth, then I'll bag the reward for myself.
  134: I . . . I can't say any more or Garl will kill me.
  135: Bite me!
  136: I don't like your looks. You'd better get away from me.
  137: What? Go away!
SID:
  100: You see Sid, Beth's assistant.
  101: Good morning.
  102: Afternoon, sir!
  103: Afternoon, ma'am!
  104: Good Evening.
  105: I know, I know . . . [whisper] she talks an awful lot doesn't she.
  106: Welcome to Beth's Weapon Shop & Rumor Mill.
  107: Beth, someone's here to see you.
  108: Welcome to Beth's Palace of Pleasure.
  109: Do you come bearing gifts?
  110: "[whisper] Don't tell her anything you don't want the whole city to know."
  111: Again?
  112: Free weapons! Come and get them!
  113: Blue light special on aisle three.
  114: She's mine, don't even think of it!
  115: She likes playing hard to get.
  116: Breakfast Break.
  117: Lunch break!
  118: Good Evening.
  119: Nice blue suit, heh. 13 your lucky number?
  120: Oh, it's mysterious man!
  121: Oh, it's a mysterious woman!
  122: Do you read palms?
  123: Oh, Beth just loves leather!
  124: Hey honey, buy his leather jacket for me.
  125: Hey honey, buy her leather jacket for me.
  126: Nice spikey armor!
  127: It's camouflage, you blend so well. Wait! Where'd you go?
  128: Hey that is one sharp looking outfit.
  129: Am not!
  130: Hey! It's the metal can! How are you doing?
DISKD:
  100: This seems strange. It looks like it can be used in your Pip Boy.
  101: 'Pip Boy displays: File Found on System. Aborting download.'
  102: 'Pip Boy displays: Downloading data from Disk.'
IAN:
  100: You see a short, stocky man.
  101: We don't like your kind in these parts.
  102: |-
    Hello, stranger. You look like you're new here. What's
     your name?
  103: My name's not important.
  104: 'I''m '
  105: "."
  106: Urgh?
  107: Well, then, neither are you.
  108: Good to meet you. I'm Ian.
  109: What do you do here?
  110: I'd like to know more about this place. Can you help?
  111: Sorry, but I don't have time to waste on morons.
  112: |-
    I was a guard for the merchants of the Hub. However, I was
     shot during a raid by bandits. I've been staying here, since the people
     have helped me recover. Still, my knowledge of the outside world
     and my experience make me useful here. Shady Sands is my
     home now. Occasionally, I even get to visit Junktown or the Hub
     to do some trading, since I'm the only person here who has ever
     really left town.
  113: You see Ian.
  114: I'm sorry to hear about your injury.
  115: Where's this Hub, and Junktown?
  116: Can you tell me about the bandits?
  117: |-
    Shady Sands is a small but self-sufficient community. The only trouble
     here is with the bandits and the Radscorpions.
  118: Why are the Radscorpions trouble?
  119: Are there many bandits?
  120: |-
    There are several. They come from various groups. They steal
     our food and occasionally shoot a few people.
     Seth organized the guards to help fight them off.
  121: Can you tell me about Seth?
  122: There are different groups? Who are they all?
  123: |-
    Radscorpions are very dangerous. They have a poisonous
     stinger in the tail, and they are very quick.
     Aradesh has been trying to find a way to get rid of them.
     If you feel brave, you could talk to Aradesh about them.
  124: Thanks. It's been healing up well, thanks to Razlo.
  125: |-
    Seth is a very brave fighter. He occasionally goes to
     the Radscorpion caves to kill a few Radscorpions, but
     they always wind up coming back. There are just too many
     for him to fight.
  126: Are the Radscorpions really that dangerous?
  127: What can I help you with?
  128: |-
    There are three groups: the Khans, the Vipers, and the
     Jackals. They pretty much hate each other, but they
     all raid Shady Sands.
  129: Tell me more about Shady Sands.
  130: He has the confident, relaxed stance of an experienced fighter.
  131: 'So, '
  132: ", what can I do for you?"
  133: Tell me about the raiders.
  134: Tell me about Radscorpions.
  135: Tell me about Shady Sands.
  136: Tell me about Seth.
  137: Can you give me directions to the Hub and Junktown?
  138: Nothing, thanks.
  139: |-
    The Hub is a big trading center far south of Shady Sands. It's run by
     several different caravan groups of merchants: the Water Merchants, the
     Crimson Caravan, and the Far Go Traders. Junktown is a little south and a ways west.
     It's smaller, but still a good place to drop in for a drink. It's overseen by a
     fellow by the name of Killian Darkwater, the local shopkeeper, sheriff, and mayor.
  140: Thanks.
  141: |-
    I may not be a very good fighter any more,
     but I'm good enough to best the likes of you!
  142: 'What can I do for you, '
  143: "?"
  144: Hmm. Nothing. Never mind, Ian.
  145: You can leave now.
  146: Can you give me directions to the Hub and Junktown?
  147: Well, since you ask, all right. See you around.
  148: No thanks. I'm needed here.
  149: Could you help me out a bit? Your experience would be useful.
  150: Let's go. It'll be good to get back into action!
  151: |-
    This is Killian's, a general store. Killian's a good man, and they
     have plenty of stock.
  152: |-
    Gizmo's casino. A hive of gambling and underworld activity. Careful; they
     say the games are rigged.
  153: This place gives me the creeps.
  154: What the hell happened here?
  155: This is gonna be a tough nut to crack.
  156: |-
    Hmm. Tempting offer, since this place gets boring. Tell ya what. Standard
     rates. 100 caps, and you've got a deal.
  157: Deal.
  158: No thanks.
  159: How about a piece of the action, instead?
  160: All right, I'll help you out in exchange for my share of loot.
  161: No, I don't think so. Come back when you have some caps.
  162: |-
    This is the Weapon Shop. It's run by Beth. She's good for guns, but
     better for gossip.
  163: Jake's weapons. High prices, but really good guns.
  164: |-
    Office of the Water Merchants. They're the big movers and shakers of the
     Hub, since they supply the water that keeps everything going.
  165: |-
    This is the Crimson Caravan. I did some work for them. They do a lot of
     high-risk jobs.
  166: |-
    Far Go Traders, run by Butch Harris. He's ot-nay oo-tay ight-bray, if you
     catch my meaning.
  167: |-
    Ah, now the Maltese Falcon is the place to be. Good music, good drinks,
     and good company.
  168: That is one ugly son of a bitch!
  169: You gain 100 experience points for convincing Ian to join your quest.
  170: |-
    Heard about some of these places before, but never been in one. Seems nice
     and clean . . . a little too clean for my taste.
  171: |-
    Not that you asked me, but the man needs to give you a little breathing
     room.
  172: Y'know, that woman couldn't lead a tango, much less a revolution.
  173: What weapons are you skilled with?
  174: |-
    I'm a good shot with just about any sort of pistol, and I can use a
     submachine gun, too. I also know how to handle a knife.
  175: I thought the Boneyard was worse.
  200: Draw your best weapon next time we go into battle.
  201: Sure thing.
  202: Can I do something for you before I go?
  203: Um, yeah. I think we should stick together, after all.
  204: Uh, no. Thanks.

  1101: |-
    Happened a few decades back. Basically, a bunch of countries got kind of
     antsy, and everything went BOOM!
  1102: |-
    A small and peaceful village. Probably the most promising community in the
     wastes.
  1103: |-
    A medium-sized town made of junk, overseen by a sherrif named Killian. It's
     just a few days southwest of Shady Sands.
  1104: |-
    The Hub is the biggest trading center in the New West. It's run primarily
     by a group called the Water Merchants, but there are some other traders there, too.
     It's a booming town, but there's a lot of political fighting between the traders.
  1105: |-
    There are several different groups of raiders out there. The most organized
     group is called the Khans; they seem to think they can conquer the world or
     something.
  1106: |-
    Most caravans come from the Hub. They travel all over the place. I worked
     for a group called the Crimson Caravan before my untimely injury.
  1107: No idea what a water chip is. Sorry, friend.

    Killian's mayor of Junktown. He also runs a store there. He's a

  1126: Gizmo runs a casino in Junktown. I hear that it's rigged, though.
  1127: Sorry, bud. Don't know much.

    Seth is the captain of the guards. Between you and me, he couldn't
     guard a fruit if it was nailed to his leg.
  1154: |-
    Aradesh is the leader of Shady Sands. A kind and patient man, although
     he's kinda looney.

    Some merchants come from the Hub to trade with Junktown. That's all

BVMEET:

    In the corner of the room is a rat-sized tunnel. They must be
     burrowing their way into the Vault through here.
LOWCRAPS:

  101: You rolled a 7. You win!!

DEMETRE:
  100: You see Demetre.
  101: Hey there! How are you doin'? The name's Demetre, Demetre Romara, head of the
    best damn caravan in the wastes. Are you lookin' for a job?
  102: |-
    Hmmm, you don't look very strong at all, but... you MUST be great
     with guns then to have survived the outside! Hell, you're probably one mean
     fighter when the time comes!
  103: You look pretty fit.
  104: You look pretty strong.
  105: Damn, you look strong!
  106: Damn! You look like you could lift a mountain!
  107: Yeah, so?
  108: What's it to you?
  109: Huh?
  110: That's just what we're lookin' for! You like the thrill and excitement of battle
    don't you?!  Bullets flying everywhere, whippin' by your head, blowin' your enemy
    in two, seein' the fear in their eyes! Ahhhh, that's the life! You look like the
    kind of person that could serve us well, and we pay well!  Oh yes, we do! We've
    just had a few new openin's, if you are interested; but of course you are, right?!
  111: What's the pay?
  112: I'll kill anything that gets in our way!
  113: No thanks.
  114: I need a water chip.
  115: What do you know about the missing caravans?
  116: I've got to go.
  117: Ugggg uggg!
  118: |-
    We pay 600 hub bucks a job! That's each way! Hell, people say we take all
     the dangerous routes but I say they're the most excitin'! You need a
     little excitement in your life, am I right? Of course I am!
  119: Hell, I think that's just what I'm lookin' for!
  120: Do you always talk so loud?
  121: Dangerous?
  122: No thanks, bub.
  123: |-
    Damn straight it is! Just go talk to Keri in the next room, she'll let you know when
     the next caravan is leavin'.
  124: Bub? What the hell are you talkin' about? Well, no skin off my back.
  125: What, are you afraid of loud noises or somethin'?
  126: Yes.
  127: Only at night.
  128: No, I was just wondering you were deaf or dumb.
  129: No, but my ears were getting a little sore.
  130: Ha! Maybe both! Well, go talk to Keri in the next room if you do want a job.
  131: |-
    You're a smart little ass, are you? Well, it doesn't matter to me!
     Just as long as you defend the caravans I'll be satisfied. Go talk to
     Keri in the next room if you want a job.
  132: |-
    Ha! That's a funny one! Well, if you think you can brave the
     darkness, come see me.
  133: Of course it's dangerous -- why else would I fork out 600 bucks?
  134: Oh, okay. Bye.
  135: I'll still take the job.
  136: Get out of here before I rip your head off!
  137: I'll shove your head up your ass!
  138: That's it!
  139: Of course you will! Go talk to Keri in the next room, she works the schedules.
  140: Hell, that's disappointin', but oh well.
  141: |-
    Yeah! I like you! You're hired! Go talk to Keri in the next room, she'll assign you to
     a caravan.
  142: |-
    A water chip? Hmmm, haven't heard of one of those before. You might
     want to check with one of the shops outside -- they have lots of stuff. So, did you want a job?
  143: Well, what's it pay?
  144: No, not really.
  145: |-
    Not much, I've only lost two. I really have no idea why they're hittin'
     the Far Go Traders more then anyone else.
  146: Any suspicions?
  147: What about your routes and cargo?
  148: Okay, thanks.
  149: |-
    Who ever is doin' this has got to have one hell of a raidin' party.
     Our caravans are well armed and you would think that someone would have
     gotten away by now. They don't leave a trace.
  150: So, how much does that job pay?
  151: What about your routes and cargo?
  152: Okay, thanks.
  153: Hell, we go to more dangerous places than they do and our cargo is better!
  154: How is your cargo better?
  155: Just checking, thanks.
  156: You're full of crap!
  157: Well, okay -- maybe it's not better but we do carry a larger variety than them.
  158: Okay, thanks.
  159: |-
    You know, Beth's been yapping about some Death Claw. I would check
     that out if I where you! I've heard a few rumors from other sources
     about somethin' creepin' around at night to the northwest.
  160: |-
    Sorry, but we're paid good money to be sure the job gets done!
     We'll only hire the best! We've got to have reliable men and women on
     those caravans!
  161: Like I really wanted a job, ya' loud-mouthed moron!
  162: Sorry to have bothered you.
  163: Please, can I have another job?
  164: Huta?
  165: I said we won't hire you!
  166: Sorry, I'm done takin' risks with you!
  167: You're wastin' your time here!
  168: Please stop botherin' me!
  169: Beat it.
  170: Demetre ignores you.
  171: Hell, I don't hire dirty chem cravers! If you want a job you better sober up!
  172: I'm no chem add . . . I mean . . . Arg!
  173: Blah!
  174: Doing chems are we? Hell, it's a good thing we aren't hiring your ass again!
  175: |-
    Hell, no! I don't think you realize just how much is at stake!
     We can't afford to take the risk! Hell, I don't no how the Far Go Traders are
     still in business with all those missin' caravans!
  176: |-
    Sorry, you'll have to see if one of the others' houses will take a
     risk with you. I can't afford to take another one.
  177: Get out of here, you make me sick!
  178: Hey! What do you think your doin'?
  179: That leads to our warehouse.
  180: It can only be opened from the other side.
  181: You're a strange one.
  182: You're wastin' your time.
  183: He ignores you.
  184: |-
    So? Do you want a job or what? I'm offerin' you a great chance at some
     excitement and lots of cash! You can never have too much of either!
  185: Oh, yeah. How much was that?
  186: I'll kill anything that gets in our way!
  187: No, thanks.
  188: I need a water chip.
  189: What do you know about the missing caravans?
  190: I've got to go.
  191: Ruk luk?
  192: |-
    Hey, you did a fine job on that last caravan -- good goin'! Did you need
     somethin'?
  193: Yeah, I wanted another job.
  194: I need a water chip.
  195: What do you know about the missing caravans?
  196: No.  Just stopped by to say hi.
  197: Nothing, bye.
  198: We lost all of our cargo! I'm afraid we can't hire you anymore, sorry.
  199: |-
    You're lucky, we almost lost that caravan you bugged out on!
     I'm afraid we can't hire you for any more jobs, sorry.
  200: We're not hiring, so what do you want?
  201: Get lost! We're not hiring.
  202: I need a water chip.
  203: Tell me what you know about the missing caravans.
  204: I want your ugly face out of my way!
  205: I want your head on a stick!
  206: Never mind.
  207: Ruk luk?
  208: You think you're tough? Don't make me laugh!
  209: Well, you should be talking to my daughter, Keri; she takes care of all that!  She's
    in the next room.
  210: I already told you. Just talk to Keri in the next room.
  211: Your daughter?
  212: That ugly thing is your daughter?  That explains a lot!
  213: Okay.
  214: |-
    Yes, she's my pride and joy! Isn't she beautiful? Just talk to her
     when you want another job. Some day . . . hopefully soon,
     I'll be able to retire and she'll take over for me.
  215: You can't if you're both dead!
  216: Okay, thanks.
  217: You dare insult someone's family? I should rip your heart out!
  218: I'm sorry, I was just kidding!
  219: I'll do more than insult you!
  220: |-
    Too late for apologies! [His face gets very red . . . then in a calm,
     controlled voice.] Get, before I make good on my threat!
  221: Is that your poor attempt at a threat?
  222: It's not a threat! You're about to die!
  223: Yeah, well, I gave it the old college try!
  224: No, I'm sorry. I've got to go. Bye!
  225: Well I've got to admit, I've heard better.
  226: Yeah, I know. See ya.
  227: Well, you're still going to die!
  228: Uh, okay.
  229: Well, what are you waiting for? There are caravans to run!
  230: They're not ready to leave yet.
  231: I've still got some things to do first.
  232: I need a water chip.
  233: Tell me what you know about the missing caravans.
  234: Okay, bye.
  235: Rik rok?
  236: Roerow?
  237: |-
    Damn! You're missing out on some good action! I'm sure there are
     lots of people, creatures, and things waiting to attack the caravans!
     Nothing beats a good fire fight! Here - take this, it'll give you something
     to play with until the next caravan is ready to go. [He hands you a frag grenade.]
  238: Damn! Do our caravans ever leave?
  239: What about your boat?
  240: Don't take too long.
  241: Keri, are we book yet?
  242: You've got to kill the enemy before it gets you!
  243: Nothin' like squeezin' the life out of your enemies!
  244: The hell you are!
  245: Damn it, where's my gun!
ELEVATR:
  100: |-
    This is the elevator. The lights are off but it looks just like
     the one in your Vault.
KATJA:
  100: You see a slender young woman with a smudged face and dark clothing.
  101: You see Katja, the thief.
  102: You're not from around here. Who're you?
  103: 'The name''s '
  104: "."
  105: I'm a traveler.
  106: I might ask the same of you.
  107: And what, may I ask, are you doing in the Boneyards?
  108: You ask a lot of questions.
  109: First you tell me who you are.
  110: I'm just an explorer.
  111: I'm looking for a replacement water chip for my Vault.
  112: You learn to be careful out here. So what are you doing here?
  113: All right, fair enough. I'm called Katja. What's it matter to you?
  114: Why so hostile?
  115: Hey, if you're going to be rude about it, then I'll see you later.
  116: I'm looking for information. Can you help?
  117: |-
    You might, but you're on my home turf, not vice-versa. So put up or
     shut up.
  118: It's not important, I'm just a traveler. I need some information.
  119: |-
    A water purification chip? Sorry, don't know anything about that. Don't
     see much of that kind of tech here in the Boneyards, except maybe the stuff
     Miles works on.
  120: Well, thanks anyhow.
  121: Miles? Where can I find him, and could he help?
  122: Can you tell me more about the Boneyards, then?
  123: |-
    Just a traveler. I've heard that one before. Nobody comes to the
     Boneyard except those Hub merchants and people looking for a quick death at the
     hands of the gangs. What are you really here for?
  124: You're right. I'm looking for a water purification chip.
  125: I don't need to tell you anything.
  126: Damn straight. But that's a two-way street.
  127: |-
    Maybe. You definitely aren't one of those gangland shiv-shovers. What
     do you want?
  128: I'm looking for a water purification chip.
  129: I need more information about the Boneyard.
  130: I need to know about the area around this city.
  131: What can you tell me about the Blades?
  132: What can you tell me about the Rippers?
  133: What can you tell me about the Gun Runners?
  134: What can you tell me about the Followers?
  135: What can you tell me about Adytum?
  136: Well, it was nice chatting. Gotta go.
  137: |-
    Miles lives in Adytum. He's a scientist, mostly working with chemistry.
     If anyone could scrounge up a water chip or make a replacement, it would be him.
  138: Thanks very much.
  139: |-
    Adytum is my original home. A little too boring for me, though. It's a
     fenced-off and self-sufficient town in the south end of the Boneyard, but not as
     far as the Cathedral. We trade sometimes with the Hub.
  140: |-
    I've dealt with them before. They're not too bad, as far as gangs go.
     They have a hide-out in an old club, with some outposts. If you're careful you
     might even be able to get some of them to talk.
  141: |-
    The Rippers are just plain ferocious. They're an inbred bunch that
     delights in torture and murder. I stay away from them, and you should, too.
     They actually put fuckin' land mines around their fortress.
  142: |-
    The Gun Runners used to be a real gang, but they went soft. They started
     setting up a deal where they trade weapons that they get from their victims or buy
     from the Hub. Since nobody here is up for the trip to the Hub personally, they do
     pretty good business, even though their prices are high.
  143: |-
    The Followers of the Apocalypse are a group of peace-preachers who live in
     a large library near the heart of the Boneyard. Why they haven't been wiped out
     yet I can't say. They are lousy combatants and have no understanding of the real
     world, but other than that they are polite and well-educated.
  144: |-
    The Boneyard is a pretty hostile place. I've never had the opportunity to
     leave, though I suppose I'd take it. Let's see . . . just south of here you have
     the Cathedral. There's some sort of cult there, but I stay away from them.
     Something sinister is going on there. Also, I've heard about the trading center
     called the Hub, and caravans occasionally show up, but I've never been there.
  145: I don't plan to stay in this place too much longer, myself.
  146: Thanks for the information.
  147: Can you tell me some more?
  148: |-
    No kidding. If you're looking for another hand, I'll sign on. Better than
     spending the rest of my existence in this hellhole, right?
  149: You're a welcome addition, but the desert's not much more fun.
  150: Don't worry about it. Thanks anyhow.
  151: Can I ask some more questions first?
  152: |-
    This area's overrun with the three gangs - the Blades, Rippers, and Gun
     Runners - as well as serving as home for the Followers and for my own home,
     Adytum.
  153: All right, looks like we've got a little ass-kicking to do!
  154: |-
    Look, 90% of the people in this city fall into one or more of three
     categories - rapists, murderers, or thieves. I'm a thief and you actually seem
     polite, so that makes me wonder, okay? Call it a survival instinct.
  155: Sorry to step on your feet then. I guess I'll just go the hell away.
  156: Well, can I at least ask a few questions?
  157: I'm not from around here, so I don't think I count.
  158: Okay, but make it quick.
  159: Huh. Guess I can't argue with that logic. So waddya want?
  160: Can I ask you some questions?
  161: I'm looking for a water purification chip. Can you help?
  162: Thanks anyhow, but I'll be going now.
  163: What's up?
  164: Can you give this lock a try?
  165: Can you take a look at this trap?
  166: Any advice?
  167: Thanks for your help. You can go now.
  168: Nothing yet. But stay tuned.
  169: You again? What're you back for now?
  170: Just wanted to stop and say hello.
  171: I have a few more questions if you can spare some time.
  172: It's unlocked.
  173: |-
    There's something funny about that bookcase on the east wall. Looks like
     it's hiding something.
  174: Put your weapons away.
  175: I hate dogs.
  176: That food smells good.
  177: What kinds of combat skills do you have?
  178: |-
    I learned how to be a scrapper from my time in the Boneyard. I'm good with
     knives and submachine guns. My favorite is throwing knives, of course.
  179: All right, although I don't feel right without a good knife.
  180: You gain 200 experience points for picking up Katja, the Boneyard scav.
  181: What do you want now?
  182: I changed my mind. I'd still like your help.
  183: Nothing. Never mind.
  184: I'm really starting to hate this place.
  185: Wow. I wish I had a hot dog and a really long stick.
  186: Oh, ugh. I think I'm gonna be sick.
  187: Hey, that wall with the tear in the plaster looks like it could move.
  188: Watch out for Deathclaws!
  189: Hubba hubba!
  190: Leave!
  191: I'm sorry but I just don't understand you.  Good bye.
  980: I don't know anything about that.
  981: I can't really say I have heard of that.
  982: No, I have not heard of that.

    The Angel's Boneyard is all that's left of the old city of Los Angeles.
     Mostly divided among warring factions, these days.
  1102: |-
    The War brought misery and death all over the world. I sure hope that
     something like that never happens again. But from what I've seen, there's not
     much hope for humanity.
  1103: |-
    Adytum used to be my home, but those people are just too paranoid and
     reclusive. They'll never survive by withdrawing from the world.
  1104: |-
    The Followers of the Apocalypse preach peace and tolerance. Too bad it
     just doesn't cut it in this world.
  1105: |-
    The Cathedral is a monumental structure south of Adytum by about a day's
     walk or so. It's run by a weird cult that worships some sort of dark god.
  1106: I don't know where you could find such a relic of old technology.
  1107: I don't know any more about that than you do.
  1108: I don't know any more about that than you do.

  1114: I don't know any more about that than you do.
  1115: I don't know any more about that than you do.

  1123: Um, small town north of the Hub, I think.
  1124: Shady what?
  1125: Shady Sands? Never heard of it.
  1126: The Hub's a huge trading center, with all sorts of stores and merchants.
  1127: I don't know any more about that than you do.
  1128: The Gun Runners sell stuff, and there's a store in Adytum.
  1129: |-
    Ugh! The Deathclaws are all over in the Boneyard. I'd rather not even
     think about them. Huge and aptly named.

     don't know anything about that.

    I've seen a rat with three eyes once. That's about all I know about

  1154: I don't know any more about that than you do.
  1155: I don't know any more about that than you do.
  1156: He's the mayor of Adytum. A fair, if somewhat vacillating, man.
  1157: They watch over Adytum and keep it under control.
  1158: |-
    I used to be a scav. We'd go out at night and try to find useful
     stuff in the ruins of the Boneyard. Very dangerous job. I got sick of Adytum,
     though.

    She's the leader of the Followers. An intelligent woman, and good

SETSCTDR:
  100: You find a crude explosive device in the doorframe.
  101: You set off an explosive trap!
  102: You disarm the trap.
  103: You did not disarm the trap.
  104: You accidentally set off the explosive!
  105: |-
    You accidentally set off the explosive, because you were smart enough
     to find it, but not smart enough to leave it alone.

  104: Yes.
  105: No.
  106: Great. We have space for another guard. Are you interested?
  107: OK. If you need work, just stop by and well will set you up.

GENSKULZ:
  100: You see a member of the Skulz gang.
  101: Hey! Whaddya think you're doing?!
  102: You're on Skulz turf, stranger. You'd better leave.
  103: Got any spare caps?
  104: What are you lookin' at?
  105: Get outta here.
  106: Zzzzz
  107: Man, it sure is hot today.
  108: I'm hungry.
  109: Let's do something.

  105: You're not a very happy person, are you?
  106: Huh huh!
  107: No, actually, I think I'll keep you around for a while.
  108: |-
    Why do you say that? I'm quite happy. I'm very happy because there
     are lots of things that bleed.
  109: You're a real sicko, you know that?
  110: Um, yeah. Bye.
  111: Ah, yes, art appreciation. Uh, I can understand that. I think.
  112: |-
    Don't say that! My mother said that! I'll make you pay! I'm a good boy,

THERESA:
  100: You see Theresa.
  101: 'Hello, '
  102: ". How fares your journey?"
  103: It's going pretty well, thanks.
  104: Not very well.
  105: Hoogh!
  106: |-
    It's good to hear that. I knew that the outside world couldn't
     be as bad as everyone says. I mean, our ancestors lived outside,
     right? But that paranoid Overseer won't let us leave.
  107: The Overseer probably has his reasons.
  108: Actually, it's pretty bad out there.
  109: You're right; the outside world isn't all that bad.
  110: |-
    The Overseer is simply trying to protect us. The outside world
     is dangerous to the unprepared.
  111: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that you're able to find the
     chip soon.
  112: Shouldn't be a problem.
  113: |-
    With all of the hazards I've been running in to, it may take
     some time.
  114: |-
    Hmm. I suppose it was too much to hope that the outside
     world had taught you to communicate. Oh well.
  115: |-
    And I suppose he chose you to go outside because he knew that
     you were under his thumb! He really just doesn't want to give
     up his control over us.
  116: I resent that remark!
  117: |-
    Actually, I think he believes that there's no reason to risk
     survival outside while it's still safe in here.
  118: |-
    Hmm. From what I've read, the outside isn't really all that
     dangerous. But I suppose that you would know better than I,
     wouldn't you?
  119: |-
    I knew that the outside couldn't be too bad. That's why I've been
     trying to convince some people to come outside with me. I think
     that we have a better chance of survival out there.
  120: What are you smoking!?
  121: That's probably a good idea.
  122: |-
    I suppose. I always figured that he just had some sort of power
     trip. But I guess that he wouldn't be the Overseer if he wasn't
     really concerned about our welfare, would he? I guess we should
     just wait and see if you can find the chip.
  123: Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
  124: |-
    Oh, come on! Wake up! If he thinks the outside is so dangerous,
     then how come he sent you out there? The man just has a control
     complex. You're a stupid tool and you don't even know it!
  125: |-
    Honestly, if he thought that the outside was that dangerous,
     he'd have sent a whole team with weapons and equipment, not
     just you. But you're his pawn, since he doesn't want anyone
     to realize what they're missing.
  126: |-
    Oh, get real! Do you really think that we can live in this Vault
     generation after generation? Maybe you can find a new chip,
     but what happens when the next thing breaks down? And the next?
  127: Huh. I guess you're right.
  128: |-
    Maybe we can't stay here forever. But rushing out into the world
     without preparation and without the consent of the group isn't
     the answer.
  129: |-
    A lot of us think so. That's why we're planning to take some
     supplies and head out in a few days. Say, do you have any
     advice for us?
  130: Sorry, I haven't really found much out there.
  131: |-
    You could head to this little village called Shady Sands,
     a few days east. They might help.
  132: Okay. Well, thanks.
  133: |-
    Oh, just go away! We don't need the help of one of the
     Overseer's pawns!
  134: |-
    Welcome to our meeting! As you have been picked by the Overseer
     to go outside, perhaps you can give us some advice before our
     move to the outdoors as well.
  135: Don't drink glowing water.
  136: Yeah . . . don't go.
  137: I think that your plans to leave are ill-advised.
  138: Hoooot!
  139: |-
    Thank you so much. I can see you're going to be a big help. Why don't
     you just leave?
  140: Sorry, I'm here to hear all of this.
  141: Fine then.
  142: |-
    Really? Considering our position, our lack of water, and the
     original purpose of this Vault, why do you think that we should stay?
  143: It's just a bad idea, is all.
  144: |-
    The outside world is too dangerous to the unprepared. It's best
     to have time to make proper preparations before going. The
     Overseer is trying to give the Vault that needed time.
  145: |-
    Well, considering that you have some experience with the
     outside, perhaps you have some valuable points to make.
  146: The outside is too dangerous and hostile. You wouldn't last long.
  147: I just need a little more time to find the water chip.
  148: |-
    If you can't give us good reasons why we shouldn't leave, then
     we're not going to wait here and die of water poisoning. Please
     don't get in our way.
  149: Sorry, folks, I can't let you do this.
  150: Very well. It's your choice.
  151: |-
    It's only a matter of time before we run out of water here.
     But the Vault was never meant to keep people inside forever!
     We have the people and the supplies to move outside now.
     We have a better chance.
  152: Outside is too dangerous.
  153: |-
    The Vault was made to release its inhabitants together as a group,
     not as a small band that will be quickly overwhelmed.
  154: |-
    Hmm. Perhaps you're right. There are probably other survivors
     out there, and they could be hostile, too. I guess we will
     need to wait for everyone else to be ready.
  155: |-
    We're well-prepared now. We have equipment and simulator training.
     A few hazards outside are better than dying slowly of thirst!
  156: Sorry, I can't let you leave now.
  157: Well, good luck then.
  158: |-
    I don't like it, but I suppose we will wait until everyone is
     ready to leave together.
  159: |-
    It's for the best. Trust me,
     I know what I'm talking about.
  160: Thank you all for coming again.
  161: Our plans are moving forward still.
  162: We are gathering more converts every week.
  163: Soon, we will have access to the gear we need.
  164: The water chip still has not been found. We must move soon.
  165: The Overseer cannot oppose such a large group.
  166: Be patient. We will only need to wait a few more weeks.
  167: Then, we will at last be free of the Vault and the Overseer.
  168: Remember to practice your outdoor skills in the simulators!
  169: Be well, everyone.
  170: Please hurry and find the water chip. We cannot wait much longer.
  171: Don't worry, I will.
  172: |-
    I didn't think you would succeed, but you did a good job. Thank you
     for saving us all.
  173: |-
    You gain 750 experience points for peacefully calming the Vault's
     revolutionary faction.
  174: Traitor! Why did you ever come back here? Now everybody will die!
  175: We've been over this before. Leave us alone.

    The Vault has been home for a long time, but it's time for us to make
     our way outside now.
  1102: |-
    I think that we have learned our lesson. It's time to build a new world,
     not worry about the old one.
  1103: |-
    Outside is where we should be! It's the great adventure, to
     start anew and to live by our own skills and wits!

  108: Who are you?
  109: Can you give me some information about the Boneyard?
  110: Tell me a bit about the other residents of Adytum.
  111: What do you do for a living?
  112: Never mind, thanks.
  113: I'm Lorraine.
  114: Can I ask you a few questions?
  115: |-
    I'm a Scav. I work with Sammael to collect stuff from the
     ruins, so that we can use it to build or trade.
  116: Why doesn't everybody here do that?
  117: How many Scavs are there?
  118: Can I ask you about something different?
  119: Nice talking to you.
  120: |-
    Well you got the Deathclaws out there, plus the Regulators take a percentage
     off the top, plus some for protection here in Adytum. Guess people don't have the upfront
     cash, or the guts to stare a Deathclaw in the eye.
  121: What's the deal with the Regulators?
  122: How do you avoid the Deathclaws?
  123: Can I ask you about some other stuff?
  124: Thanks. Bye.
  125: |-
    Oh, there's half a dozen of us. Sammael was the first one, and
     he's still the best.
  126: Can I ask you about some other stuff?
  127: Interesting. Thanks.
  128: |-
    They keep the peace around here, and control all the money coming in and going out.
     The rest of the people here pretty much work for the Regulators, and
     that ain't the most forgiving job. Many of them don't ever see
     beyond the fence that surrounds this place.
  129: All that makes you wonder what Julianna was thinking.
  130: What do you mean about Julianna?
  131: Very nasty. Can I ask some other things?
  132: Thanks for the warning.
  133: |-
    Oh, she wound up falling for some Blade a while ago. Poor
     dear can't leave the town, of course, and Caleb would kill
     the young lad on sight. Very tragic.
  134: Uh . . . if you say so.
  135: Can I ask some other questions?
  136: Hmm. Thanks for filling me in. Bye.
  137: |-
    We only scavenge after dark. And we're very good at what we
     do. Sammael's got a little test that he likes to throw out
     at people, before he lets them become Scavs.
  138: What's the test?
  139: Still sounds dangerous.
  140: I see. Mind if we back up a bit?
  141: Interesting. Bye.
  142: |-
    Sammael has the person hide somewhere within Adytum during the
     day. If he can't find the student in an hour, then he lets
     the person join the next scavenger party.
  143: What a stupid system!
  144: Seems to work. You're still alive.
  145: Huh. Can I ask you about some other things?
  146: Interesting. Bye.
  147: |-
    Come now, isn't there the faintest trace of a romantic in
     you? Really, it's too bad. Unrequited love and all of that.
     Tragic.
  148: |-
    Hmpf. Shows what you know. Tell that to Sammael. If you
     can find him.
  149: |-
    Yes, although it can be rough. It's very dangerous, especially
     if you're caught.
  150: No doubt. Can I ask about something else?
  151: Thanks for the info.
  152: Wow, I think you're a little beyond my help.
  153: |-
    This used to be a big city, called Los Angeles. But the
     bombs hit really hard. Now, there's just the Angel's
     Boneyard. We Adytowners are just trying to survive in the
     wreckage.
  154: Can you tell me more about Los Angeles?
  155: I see. Thanks.
  156: "Lots of people lived here. From what I hear, the survivors hid in\n a big

    Zimmerman watches over our town. He makes sure that everyone
     gets fed, and that everybody has a job to do.

    Caleb is the leader of the Regulators. It's his job to
     protect Adytum. He seems to enjoy it a litte more than he should.
  179: |-
    Ah, our resident chemist. Miles makes bullets, and he also
     built the water distiller that makes sure we get clean
     water from the well. He's working on an underground
     farm right now, but he's missing some parts.

    Tine runs the shop. It's in the bunker near the gate.

    Hey, I think you'd better be leaving.
     We don't want your kind here.

    I can't believe that Tandi has disappeared. I hope you are
     going to find her. It would really hurt Aradesh if something bad happened to her.

    Thanks for returning Tandi. It's a good sign for the
     future, don't you think?
  104: That's a damn shame about Tandi. I hope Aradesh will be ok.

  106: Uh, thanks. Bye.
  107: Why not?
  108: Hnnng!
  109: |-
    Not so fast! This is a small community. We don't see strangers often, and
     we don't really need them if you get my meaning. If you don't have a good
     reason to be here, you'd better just keep moving.
  110: Hey, I ain't gonna hurt anybody.
  111: Uh.
  112: I wasn't saying that you was gonna. You'd just better leave us alone.
  113: I'll try not to make trouble.

  115: |-
    Look, Shady Sands don't need your kind from the Hub,
     or Junktown, or wherever you come from. We do pretty good
     by ourselves.
  116: |-
    The last trader from the Hub sold us a malfunctioning
     irrigation pump. We've had it with your dirty deals.
  117: You got it all wrong. I'm not like that.
  118: Yeah, right. So you say. Just don't get into any trouble, Ok?
  119: No problem.
  120: Yeah, whatever.

    Seth's a very good fighter. He's very determined. A little too much,
     sometimes. Still, he's devoted to the welfare of our village.
  111: |-
    Well, Shady Sands was founded by a great ancestor of our current
     leader, Aradesh. He could tell you more of the story. We have a

     human parts in the wall itself. The worst part is that it is moving,
     calling to you.
  101: |-
    Your nose starts to bleed. You hear voices in your head. They are
     calling your name. Darkness washes over your eyes for a moment, but you
     recover.

    A voice calls to you. You turn you head and see the image of a
     forgotten friend, obviously dead. The worms fall from her rotted jaw as
     your headache grows.

    It is getting harder to move forward. Your foot seems bonded to the
     floor. You look down, and the flesh of the floor is crawling up your leg.
     Teeth gnaw at your knees. Still, your headache gets worse.
  104: |-
    Something catches your attention, a flash of movement from the
     ceiling, and then a sliver of bone pierces your eye! With it comes the
     thoughts of the dead and tortured!
  105: |-
    The pain in your head is maddening. You feel the sins of others
     wash over your soul. And it gets worse, as your sins answer them. Like
     madmen, they fight through your psyche, and in the process tear your
     personality apart.
  106: |-
    Your head is pulsing with the intrusive thoughts of others. The
     pain grows and grows. Suddenly, as if it never existed, the pain vanishes.
     You fall to the ground and weep. But something does not feel right.
  107: |-
    The pain in your head does not feel as bad as it did. The effects of
     this strange corridor do not feel as strong.
FGTGARD:
  100: You see a guard for the Far Go Traders.
  101: Those damn Water Merchants are ripp'n us all off.
  102: Be sure to pay the FLC on time, they're a deadly lot.
  103: You'll want to talk to Rutger.
  104: Far Go Traders are the best.
  105: The Crimson Caravan are a bunch of idiots and lunatics.
  106: Hmm, I've a craving for some iguana on a stick.
  107: Who the hell is stealing our caravans?
  108: My brother was on the last caravan that disappeared.
  109: Those water misers are responsible, I know it.
  110: Mutants took the caravans I hear. Terrible thing.
  111: Heard you say some Mutants.  Hope you made'em pay.
  112: I thought the Death Claw was responsible, damn mutants.
  113: We're closed. Come back in the morning.
  114: Hey, this isn't the Falcon. Get the hell out.
  115: What are you? Some kind of a Skag? Get the hell out.
  116: Beat it!
  117: We're only open during the day.
  118: Are you on chems? Get lost.
  119: You need to come back in the morning.
GLOCOMP:
  100: This terminal seems to have been destroyed by the blast.
  101: This computer looks like it could have stored megabytes of data.
  102: You wonder what data could have been on this computer.
  103: It looks like this computer was once connected to a mainframe.
MVBSHELF:
  100: |-
    The bookshelf is filled with religious and philosophical books. It is
     very dusty.
  101: |-
    You take a book down, examine it, and quickly replace it on the shelf. The
     shelf itself seems very sturdy.
BROINVAD:
  100: I'm here to kick ass and chew bubble gum. I'm all out of gum.
  101: The Brotherhood is praying for our success, sir.
  102: Let's move out.
  103: Maintain your tactical presence, sir.
  104: We'd better get going.
  105: No time to chat, sir.
  106: I'm here to kick ass and chew bubble gum. I'm all out of gum.
  107: The Brotherhood is praying for our success, ma'am.
  108: Let's move out.
  109: Maintain your tactical presence, ma'am.
  110: We'd better get going.
  111: No time to chat, ma'am.
  112: Good, you're here. Let's torch this place.
  113: There is something wrong about this room.
  114: This place is starting to give me the heebee-jeebies.
  115: Time for us to head back to the Brotherhood now.
COOKTABL:
  100: |-
    The table appears to be full of items the cooks are
     using to make a meal.
  101: The food is not cooked yet. It will poison you if you eat it raw.
KILDOOR1:
  100: The door is locked.
  101: You pick the lock.
  102: You attempt to pick the lock, but fail.
  103: While picking the lock, you manage to tweak the tumblers and jam it.
  104: The door isn't locked.
AGATHBED:
  100: The bed looks neatly made despite its tattered nature.
  101: You see a tattered bed.
  102: Agatha would not be happy if you messed up her bed.
TYCHO:
  100: You see a man in dusty leather armor with a trenchcoat and gas mask.
  101: You see Tycho.
  102: |-
    Another new face. Travelers here are a dime a dozen. But you have the
     look of someone different. Care to join me for a drink?
  103: Sorry, I'm rather pressed for time.
  104: Sure.
  105: Duh-wah?
  106: |-
    Delightful. I hope you don't mind your drink well-watered - they treat
     beer here like it's a potted plant.
  107: So, what's your story?
  108: Yeah, a drink of water. Never mind.
  109: |-
    I could ask the same of you. In the interest of amity, I suppose I'll
     tell first. I'm called Tycho. Came from out east, what used to be called Nevada.
  110: That's a pretty long trip.
  111: How did you survive all the dangers?
  112: |-
    Yeah, it was. Decided to take it easy for a while. This place shows some
     promise, just as soon as someone cleans up some of the scum.
  113: Why don't you?
  114: Yeah, I noticed. What do you know about those jerks?
  115: |-
    Had some pretty good training, and some good weapons, too. My grandfather
     was a Ranger way back when, and he taught my father everything he knew. Dad
     passed it on to me. So I know enough not to drink glowing water, so to speak.
  116: Interesting. Thanks for the drink.
  117: Really? Survival's tough these days. You must be pretty knowledgeable.
  118: |-
    Not my place. I'd rather not cross Killian, after all. He'll clean up
     this town when he gets around to it. A good man, mark my words. But watch out
     for that fellow Gizmo. Reminds me of another fat freak my father told me about
     back in Las Vegas.
  119: Thanks for the tip, and the drink.
  120: |-
    There's two grades of scum here. One of 'em's the Skulz, a gang that hangs
     out in back of Marcelles' crash house. They're just grade-B twerps. But the other
     ones answer to a fat freak whose name you can probably guess. Runs the casino.
     Those guys are organized and dangerous.
  121: I see. Thanks for the info.
  122: |-
    Yeah, well, my family taught me everything there is to know about survival.
     Don't drink water that's totally clear and free of insects and moss, for instance.
     Only poisonous or radioactive water would be that clean in the wilderness.
     Lots of other little things to look out for, too.
  123: Like what?
  124: Well, if you've got some time, I could go over some pointers.
  125: Sure, that would be great.
  126: Sorry, I'm kind of pressed for time.
  127: |-
    Whoa, not so fast. We never finished introductions, remember? What's your
     name, stranger?
  128: 'I''m '
  129: "."
  130: None of your business, you nut.
  131: Good to meet you. Step carefully, friend.
  132: |-
    Now, now, no need to get impolite. But with that attitude you'd best be
     on your way.
  133: Bite me.
  134: Whatever. See ya.
  135: What do you want?
  136: Sorry to disturb your private time. Go wank somewhere else.
  137: I need information about the gangers here.
  138: I need information about the town.
  139: Hello again. How can I help you?
  140: Killian's asked me to clean up this town, and I'd like your help.
  141: |-
    Well, this is the Skum Pitt, a wretched hive of villainy and all that. Just
     west of here is Gizmo's, a big casino. Word is the games are rigged. A little south
     of here is the Crash House, run by Marcelles, where you can get a night's sleep
     for way too many caps. Past that is Killian's. Killian runs a general store, and
     he also enforces the law in this town - a good man. Then south of there you have
     Doc Morbid, whose operation is a little funny, if you take my meaning.
  142: I hope that my little instruction course helped a bit.
  143: "[]"
  144: |-
    Word out is that you've been having some contacts with Gizmo. I'd step
     carefully around that barrel of lard if I were you.
  145: My business is none of yours.
  146: Yeah, I work for Gizmo now. What's it to you?
  147: |-
    Fair enough. But watch your back. Gizmo isn't known for his consideration
     for his employees.
  148: |-
    Suffice to say that your employer has caused more than enough misery and
     strife in this town. Don't expect much help from anyone, least of all Gizmo.
     Too bad. You might've been able to change this town for the better.
  149: What can I do for you?
  150: Any recommendations?
  151: Thanks for your help. I think it's time to part ways.
  152: |-
    Yeah, I'd stay the hell away from whatever made that. Seriously, I've never
     seen anything like that. I think our best option is to move on, fast.
  153: Very well. I must say that it has been an honor and a pleasure.
  154: |-
    Watch out for radioactive hot spots. This place obviously sustained a
     direct nuclear strike, and secondary cascade radiation may be bad. I'd
     recommend avoiding this place completely if we can.
  155: |-
    Note the lack of any animal life for quite a distance. And the piles of
     bones. Whatever lives here is a real beast. Keep your weapon handy.
  156: A military place like this must have a central command room somewhere.
  157: |-
    I bet we could get through those force-field generators with a little
     hot-wiring, or if we could find the force field control computer.
  158: |-
    There are many strange tales about Necropolis, the city of the dead. Stay
     alert, because it could get dangerous really fast.
  159: I need to change formation.
  160: What distance do you want me at?
  161: Stay close.
  162: Keep a moderate distance.
  163: Move out to longer range.
  164: What sorts of weapon skills have you learned?
  165: |-
    Pretty good ranger training: I can use a spear, of course, in a pinch;
     I'm also skilled with small pistols and rifles.
  166: Uh, never mind.
  167: Yeah, if you like your lizard well-done.
  168: |-
    Well it's about time. Lead on, my friend, and let's do some street sweeping.
     I'd recommend knocking over Gizmo, if I may.
  169: |-
    Well it's about time. Lead on, my friend, and let's do some street sweeping.
     I'd recommend knocking over Gizmo, if I may.
  170: Yes?
  171: I think maybe we should stick together, after all.
  172: Nothing. Never mind.

    Well, Junktown's not really home, but it's an interesting city. It has
     potential, although I don't know that building out of the refuse of the past is the
     best way to construct the future.
  1101: |-
    We Rangers hail from back east, what used to be called Nevada. Our
     heritage stretches back to the days of the Texas Rangers. We learn survival and
     combat skills in order to go out into the world and have a chance of surviving and
     making things better.
  1102: |-
    I haven't seen a relic of old technology like a water chip for a long
     time. Personally, you're better off depending on yourself, not on some piece of
     tech that you can't fix.
  1103: |-
    The War was a testament to human greed and insanity. Let's hope that we
     have learned enough to never repeat such folly.
  1104: |-
    The wastes are hostile and dangerous, even to the wary traveler.
     Radiation and strange creatures will take their toll. Tread with caution, and
     remember that everything you see and hear is a clue.
  1105: I'm sorry, I can't help you there.

    The City of Death is well named. It lies in what used to be the little
     town of Bakersfield. Now, though, it's home to ghouls and worse.

    The Hub's a giant merchantile community, just a short ways south of
     Junktown.
  1127: |-
    Gizmo's casino is probably one of the last places I'd want to go,
     unless I were going to step on Gizmo's neck. Not that I could get a foot past
     all the blubber.
  1128: Killian has a decent general store in Junktown.
  1129: |-
    Heard some tales about something faster, bigger, and meaner than
     any living creature has a right to be. Not too many, though, which means that
     it doesn't leave many survivors. Big claws, ferocious disposition.

    Some merchants from the Hub visit Junktown and other cities on

KILLSAFE:
  100: 'You see: Safe.'
  101: The safe is not locked.
  103: Got it!
  104: Drat! Almost had it.
  105: The safe is locked.
  106: You gain 500 experience points for cracking Killian's personal safe.
  107: You tweak the tumblers and manage to jam the lock with a pick. Just great.
DEMODOG:
  100: You see a dog. He seems to be following you.
  101: You see a dog.
  102: Woof!
  103: Grrr!
  104: It seems that you have made a friend of this dog.
  105: You earn 550 experience points for befriending the dog.
  106: You earn 335 experience points for defeating the dog and letting Phil back
    into his house.
  107: You earn 35 experience points for killing the dog.
SAMMY2:
  100: You see Sammy.
  101: We can't leave until all the radscorpions are dead.
BVCACHE:
  100: |-
    There is an emergency medical cache on the east
     wall. It may prove useful.
MUTEJAR:

  101: You take the odd fruit from the jar.
RUBCHIP:
  100: |-
    You are able to determine that the Command and the Control Center
     is definitely buried under even more rock. You will have to look for
     the water chip elsewhere.

    The large amount of rubble blocking this corridor looks impressive.
     You don't think that it can be moved, even with high yield explosives.

  103: " experience points."
GUNTHER:
  100: You see Gunther.
  101: You see a stern man in his thirties.
  102: Welcome to my humble house.  What can I do for you?
  103: Could you tell me a little about the Hub?
  104: Where can I find some ammo and weapons around here?
  105: What do you do around here?
  106: Who's the law around here?
  107: Sure, what else would you like to know?
  108: |-
    It is a sprawling city, the largest I have seen in my life.  The center
     of the town lies to the south, with the other areas branching off in each direction
     from there.
  109: Where can I find supplies?
  110: If I was looking for a job, where would be a good place to start?
  111: Can I ask you another question?
  112: Thanks for the info.  Goodbye.
  113: |-
    I get everything that I need from Mitch down by the Maltese Falcon.  Just head
     on south from here.
  114: |-
    I occasionaly do a stint on one of the caravans that head out from here.  If
     you're looking for that kind of work, just talk to one of the trading houses.  I'm
     partial to the Far Go Traders, but I've worked with all of them.
  115: |-
    Well, I buy most of my stuff from Beth over in the Weapon Store.  Got a pretty
     good selection.
  116: What would I do if I was looking for something a little more 'exotic'.
  117: Will mentioning your name help with the price?
  118: |-
    I've heard there is some guy over in Old Town that deals in stuff with a little
     more punch.
  119: |-
    Probably not, she's sweet on her bodyguard Sid.  But, you might want to try
     Butch, he runs the Far Go Traders - which owns her store.
  120: |-
    I get by.  I hire on with the caravans when I'm a little short on cash, and
     work for the farmers down south a bit.
  121: |-
    Well, you probably passed Deputy Fry on your way down here.  His boss is
     Sheriff Greene, and you'll find him in the Police Station most of the time.

    can help you.

    You see a small building, with a series of tents nearby. The
     inhabitants look dirty and mean.

    You come across a medium-sized town. A wall of junked cars blocks
     easy entrance. A hazy smoke lies low over the town.

    To the south you see a large city. Outlying farms surround the town.
     There is much life in this desert oasis.

    You approach a dark and broken city. Little life can be seen. A stench
     of death surrounds the area.

     guards in heavy armor patrol the area.
  108: A large crater sprawls to the north.

    Mutant guards can be seen to the northeast in front of a fortified
     location built into the side of the mountain.

     gun ports, looms ahead.

    The signs of gang activity are evident in the partially-rebuilt nightclub
     and tiny outposts here.
  114: |-
    In the heart of the city, a great library, fortified and restored, rises
     with forbidding yet graceful presence. You feel a sense of peace.
  115: A fenced village, patrolled by guards, waits defiantly to the south.
  116: |-
    You see a giant footprint in the ground. You search but find no other
     tracks in the area.
  117: Scorch marks and ashes cover the area.
  118: This area looks like it was hit by a high-pressure firebomb.
GROUNDR:
  100: You see a ghoul undergrounder.
  101: We just want to be left alone.
  102: Set is an incompetent fool who will get us killed.
  103: |-
    The super mutants are going to kill us some day and
     Set does not help.
  104: We're hiding here; please don't tell anyone where we are.
  105: I don't like your looks.
  106: Go away and leave us alone.
  107: I've heard bad things about you. Are they all true?
WEAPSYS:
  100: It looks as though the automated security system is armed.
RNDCITY:
  100: You have stumbled into a super mutant ambush!
  101: Looks like you've stumbled into a gang war!
  102: A group of hostile raiders bursts forth!
  103: A large group of rats comes scurrying down the streets!
  104: A group of hostile gangers bursts forth!
  105: You are suddenly attacked by rats!
BLKROOM:
  100: |-
    The rubble has piled up high in the entrance way. It is too
     heavy to move. You wonder if the water chip might have once
     been there. If it was, it is no longer available.
  101: |-
    Big, heavy rocks are blocking the way to the room. You
     strain to move a rock, but it fails to budge.
LARYKNIG:
  100: You see a Knight.
  101: Hello Initiate. I'm Larry, how may I help you?
  102: Vree said you could show me a laser pistol?
  103: Vree said you could give me a laser pistol.
  104: Ug.
  105: Uh, okay...
  106: |-
    Uh, yea. These things are great. It's range is... well, as far
     as you can see. (Larry continues to talk for what seems like hours, but
     you seem to pick a few things up about the use of energy weapons.)
  107: |-
    Huh? But she knows these aren't ready yet... Oh, she must have
     meant show. Yea, I can show you. You see it runs off of energy cells
     that are constructed out of... (Larry goes on for what seems hours but
     you seem to pick a few things up about energy weapons.)
  108: Sure she did. I think you should leave outsider.
  109: I don't like liars, please leave.
  200: This isn't right at all.
  201: There we go.
  202: The firing mechanism keeps jamming.
  203: That's much better.
  204: Almost got it.
  205: This is going to take a while.
  206: That's the problem!
  207: John, I think I isolated the problem.
  208: Damn!
  209: Darn!
  210: My fault!
  211: I'm okay.
  212: Okay, that hurt.
  213: I meant to do that.
  214: Why does that keep happening?
  215: My eyes!
  216: You're not a knight.
  217: I need to talk to a knight.
  218: I don't understand, the power cells keep shorting out.
  219: You should stand back these can be dangerous.
  220: Please don't distract me.
  221: Watch where you're standing.
  222: You lost?
  223: Sorry, I can't talk right now.
  300: Energy Weapons increases 5%.
JENNIFER:
  100: You see Jennifer.
  101: You see a Paladin.
  102: |-
    Excuse me, Brother. You should put away your weapon whenever
     you are in the Brotherhood. We are a friendly order, but as
     you know, times are rough.
  103: |-
    Some members of the Brotherhood might be offended if a
     stranger . . . I mean, a new Initiate . . . approaches them
     with a weapon.
  104: Good day, Initiate. How may I help you?
  105: |-
    Hello, Sister, it's good to see there are women of rank in
     this organization. I didn't know what to expect with a name like
     the Brotherhood.
  106: |-
    Hey there, legs. You are looking mighty fine. What time should
     I pick you up?
  107: Oooooga!
  108: Could you tell me where I might find our High Elder?
  109: Who's in charge of this hole?
  110: Where's this High Elder guy?
  111: Gruk!
  112: |-
    Maxson, the High Elder, can be found on the Fourth Floor.
     If you take the other elevator down to level four, he should
     be either in the Council Room or the Elders's rooms.
  113: |-
    You can ask one of the guards on that level; they should know
     where he is at the moment.
  114: Thank you.
  115: Where can I get some better weapons?
  116: |-
    You should talk to Talus. He might be able to help you, or
     at least tell you who to talk to.
  117: |-
    During the day, Talus is normally supervising in the training hall.
     Do you know where that is?
  118: Yes, I do. Thank you.
  119: No.
  120: Of course I do!
  121: |-
    The training hall is right around the corner. Just go down this
     corridor, make a left, go through the door at the end of
     the corridor and it will be through the door on your right.
  122: |-
    You have been extremely helpful. Thank you very much.
     I hope we can talk again soon. Good day.
  123: |-
    Training hall? Do you think I could get some training there?
     I am a member of the Brotherhood now, right?
  124: |-
    Thank you for your help, Sister. It's good to see there are
     women of rank in this organization. I didn't know what to
     expect with a name like the Brotherhood.
  125: |-
    Thanks, Sugar. You know, you're looking mighty fine. What
     do you say you and me check out each other's 'equipment'
     later? What time do you get off?
  126: Oh, that place. Okay, bye.
  127: Excuse me? Is there something wrong?
  128: Muk lug?
  129: |-
    I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you. You should go see the
     doctor. She's on the second level.
  130: |-
    Of course there are. Two of our five Elders are women, our master
     scribe is a woman, and we have many other women in all the
     different ranks.
  131: |-
    The women of the Brotherhood are also called Brothers. We don't call
     the women Sisters. This is the Brotherhood of Steel, after all,
     not the Brother and Sisterhood of Steel.
  132: |-
    Don't you find it peculiar that it is called the Brotherhood,
     implying that its members consist solely of men?
  133: But why is it called the Brotherhood, then?
  134: Well, it just seemed strange.
  135: |-
    I do not know. That has been our name all of my life. I'm sure
     there is a reason for it.
  136: I guess you're right.
  137: Well, it still seems a little strange to me.
  138: |-
    That is strange. I've never really put much thought into it.
     We've been the Brotherhood of Steel all of my life. Our
     ancestors must have had a reason for naming it so.
  139: But that doesn't mean things can't change.
  140: Yeah, you're probably right.
  141: So, is there anything else I can help you with?
  142: Yes, where can I find the High Elder?
  143: Where can I get better weapons?
  144: No, that's it. Bye.
  145: |-
    No, we're very strict when it comes to tradition. I don't think
     it could ever be changed. It doesn't bother me at all to be
     addressed as a Brother. That is curious, though.
  146: |-
    I think I'll have a talk with Vree. She might be able to give
     some insight as to why our ancestors decided to call us the
     Brotherhood of Steel.
  147: Who's Vree? One of the Elders?
  148: |-
    Vree's the Master Scribe. She is the one you should talk to
     if you have any technical questions, but don't disturb her
     during her meditations at night.
  149: |-
    She almost always stays in her room, which is also occupied
     by the mainframe on the third floor.
  150: |-
    Hole? How dare you talk like that about the Brotherhood.
     You are a member of our order now, and should be proud
     to be a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.
  151: |-
    Proud? Why? You're all just a bunch of robotic hop-heads, hiding
     from the real world. There's nothing to be proud of there.
  152: |-
    I'm sorry. I get a little carried away with myself
     sometimes.
  153: Yeah, right.
  154: Well, I guess we all do sometimes.
  155: So who is in charge of this place?
  156: Yeah. Well, I've got to go.
  157: Maxson, the High Elder. He's on the fourth floor.
  158: "[]"
  159: "[]"
  160: "[]"
  161: "[]"
  162: "[]"
  163: "Well, you are cute . . . but I don't think so. I don't think\n it would be
    a good idea to get involved with an outsider,\n anyways. You are cute, though,
    and somewhat attractive. "
  164: |-
    I don't know if it's because you're an outsider or because
     of your extreme . . . lack of tact? So, 'honey', is there
     anything else I can do for you?
  165: Yeah, uh, I guess. Uh, who's in charge around here?
  166: |-
    Uh, okay . . . um. How about some weapons then? Where can
     I get my hands on some of those?
  167: Hmmph!
  168: No.
  169: |-
    That's . . . pretty funny. You are joking, I hope? Actually . . .
     don't answer that. I don't think I want to know.
  170: Yeah, REAL funny. Almost as much as your face!
  171: Thanks a lot. That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.
  172: I'm out of here.
  173: |-
    I'm sorry. It's just that you outsiders have such a strange
     way of talking to people sometimes. Is there anything I can
     help you with?
  174: |-
    Well, I guess I should talk to this High Elder person.
     Where is he at?
  175: |-
    I would like to get some better weapons. Who do I talk
     to about that?
  176: No.
  177: |-
    Are you for real? I haven't heard such a pitiful line
     in all my life!
  178: Yeah? Well, I don't get out much. Okay?
  179: Get out of my face, you walking garbage can!
  180: Pfft!
  181: |-
    Well, yes, you are a member of the Brotherhood, but the Elders
     have put a hold on all training of new Initiates.
  182: Why?
  183: |-
    Oh, that's just GREAT! Why the hell did I join this stupid
     group? Where's the door?!
  184: |-
    There are rumors about some kind of army. I think the Elders
     want to concentrate their resources on the ones that are already
     far enough along in their training to make a difference if we
     do have a big battle on our hands.
  185: |-
    We strongly believe that training a few fighters extremely
     well is better than giving mediocre training to a bunch of
     fighters. Saving lives is one of our primary objectives.
  186: |-
    You could probably get quite a bit out of the training just
     by watching. Brother Thomas is the best trainer we have ever had
     at the Brotherhood.
  187: |-
    Well, I'm to be working on the outside of the Brotherhood, right?
     It's a very hostile world out there and I'll be putting my life
     on the line every minute I'm out there. Don't you think I should
     be given training if I want or need it, or do you only 'say'
     it is your primary objective to 'save' lives?
  188: Thank you for the suggestion, I'll take a look.
  189: You're all a bunch of fools.
  190: Can you tell me where Maxson is?
  191: |-
    Well, I'm only repeating what I was told. If you talk to Thomas
     or Talus they might be able to make an exception.
  192: Okay, thanks.
  193: They'd better. I've jumped through enough hoops for you guys.
  194: So, can you tell me where Maxson is?
  195: Oh, my darling. When are we going to marry?
  196: You're looking so handsome, as always.
  197: Give me a kiss.
  198: I've missed you so much.
  199: I'll wait up for you.
  200: I've been thinking about you all day.
  201: You're so cute when you look at me like that.
  202: Don't scare me like that. I thought I'd never see you again.
  203: You didn't come by last night.
  204: |-
    How long has it been since I've last seen you? It seems
     like an eternity.
  205: I've missed you ever so much.
  206: Come to bed, honey.
  207: We can get married in the morning.
  208: I think we should have about five kids.
  209: |-
    Where do you want to go for our honeymoon? I hear
     the Children of the Cathedral have a beautiful place.
  210: My parents are still waiting to meet you.
  211: |-
    Why hello again. I hope things are well with you.
     I hope you've talked to Vree.
  212: 'Hello, Brother '
  213: "."
  214: Be careful if you go to the north. Our scouts never returned.
  215: 'Brother '
  216: ", it's good to see you again."
  217: |-
    Have you talked to Rhombus? He's the Head Knight. He's just
     right over there in that room.
  218: I don't have time to talk. I'm busy.
  219: Sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk to rude people.
  220: Don't bother me.
  221: What? Can't you go bother someone else?
  222: Go away.
  223: I don't want to talk to you.
  224: Initiate, get back to your studies.
  225: No time to talk, Initiate.
  226: Come over here, you hunk!
  227: Darling, over here!
  228: " I've missed you."
  229: I've got the nursery ready, darling.
  230: Hi, honey.
  231: I see you.
  232: You've got to meet my parents.
  233: Yoo hoo!
  234: Come here, my little snookums.
  235: Are you teasing me?
  236: You're playing hard to get, aren't you?
  237: Over here, sweaty!
  238: Hi honey!
  239: There you are. I was starting to worry.
  240: Come here and give me a kiss, handsome.
  241: Come on in, darling.
GABRIEL:
  100: You see a large well armed man.
  101: You see Gabriel, leader of the Gun Runners.
  102: It's not often that we get visitors, how can I help you?
  103: Why don't you  get many visitors?
  104: What is it you do here?
  105: This place isn't very accessible with a nest of those damn Deathclaws right
    outside our factory.
  106: You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?
  107: We've gone over there and taken out a few, but they always seem to come back.
    Besides, we're machinists, not fighters.
  108: What would you give me if I went in there and took care of them for you?
  109: We manufacture weapons and ammunition.  We've been at this for the last 30
    years.  But the last 10 have been hell.
  110: Why is that?
  111: We've stripped the area surrounding our factory of all the scrap metals that
    were left after the war.  Now we have to rely on Adytum to supply us with raw
    materials.
  112: What's so bad about Adytum  supplying you with your materials?
  113: At first it was fine.  They supplied us with raw materials, we manufactured
    and sold the weapons.  Then 3 years ago Zimmerman hired some mercenaries to help  protect
    Adytum from the deathclaw and the odd random attack by raiders.  Those Regulators
    are cold hearted bastards and are squeezing us for all we have.  We make the guns
    and they get rich off of it.
  114: Why don't you just leave and set up some where else?
  115: That's rough. What would you give me to take care of deathclaw?
  116: We would if we could.  But moving is a major undertaking with all the lathes
    and mills.  These are things that aren't just picked up easily moved.  We could
    move but the deathclaw make it impossible.
  117: You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?
  118: If you could get rid of the Deathclaws once and for all you could name your
    price.
  119: I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.
  120: "[]"
  121: If you clean out that area we'll be leaving, but we'll leave behind more weapons
    and ammunition than you could possibly use.
  122: OK.  You got yourself a deal.
  123: I'll have to think about it.
  124: People who would fix all of your problems with Adytum.
  125: You clear out the Deathclaws, all of them, and you got yourself a deal.
  126: OK.  I'll do it.
  127: I'll have to think about it.
  128: Hello again.
  129: What is it you do here?
  130: Bye.
  131: "[]"
  132: It's been going OK.
  133: I think I've killed all the Deathclaws.
  134: We need to be sure.  We've killed over 20 in the past 2 years and they always
    seem to come back.  And we could never figure out how.  Let's give it a few days
    and if they are still gone we'll see what we can do for ya'.
  135: OK Thanks
  136: Let us know when you've taken care of the Deathclaws.
  137: Yeah. See you around, maybe.
  138: I know, tell me about it.
  139: See you around, maybe.
  140: It's not often that we get visitors, can I help you?
  141: Why is  it that you don't get many visitors?
  142: What is it you do here?
  143: This place isn't very accessible, with a nest of those damn Deathclaw right
    outside our factory.
  144: I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.
  145: We would if we could.  But moving is a major under taking with all the lathes
    and mills.  These are things that aren't just picked up and easily moved.  We
    could move but the Deathclaw make it impossible.

  150: No need to pay me.  Your thanks is enough.
  151: You got it- just take whatever you want. We're pulling out of here in a day
    or two, but we'll leave more weapons and ammo than you could carry right now.
    Just come back here whenever you need them.

  169: Guns, I like Guns!
  170: I have some friends who can really use some of your weapons.
  171: I have some friends who can really use some of your weapons.
  172: How goes it, my friend?
  173: How goes it, my friend?
  174: You what?!  You've killed them all? Thank the gods! Now we can move to where
    we can get our own materials and not have to rely on those snakes in Adytum.  You
    name it and you've got it, my friend.
  175: You what?!  You've killed them all? Thank the gods! Now we can move to where
    we can get our own materials and not have to rely on those snakes in Adytum.  You

    up to move. Help yourself to whatever you need.
  183: Sorry I can't talk to you, friend, but we're busy getting this place packed

    regulators.
  185: There's no reason to leave now that your friends have gotten rid of those damn
    regulators.
  186: Welcome, friend. What can I help you with?
  187: Welcome, friend. What can I help you with?
  188: You need to talk to Zack about buying things.
AMBER:
  100: You see Amber, a teacher for the Followers.
  101: Now is when I rest. Please, come back during the evening.
  102: Welcome noble traveler. Have you come here to study?
  103: No. I really came here just to kill things.
  104: Depends on what you want to teach me.
  105: Yes, I am willing to learn.
  106: |-
    I am truly sorry to hear that. The Followers believe in peace at all
     costs. For that reason, I have renounced violence. Good evening.
  107: |-
    I am skilled in many of the languages and arts. Perhaps you would like
     to learn one of those?
  108: I'm sorry, but I need to know things which will help me survive.
  109: I have no time for that type of stuff. I'm gone.
  110: Perhaps I can listen to a song or two.
  111: Can you teach me anything else?
  112: |-
    Ah, we have here a student of life. In a case like this, I can teach you
     some herbalism, but training takes a while for little result.
  113: Fine, just teach me.
  114: Please, teach me what you can.
  115: Sorry, I really don't have time for plants. Goodbye.
  116: You need not be rude. Apologize now, or I won't teach you.
  117: I am sorry. Will you please teach me?
  118: Forget it.
  119: That is better now. We will begin your studies.
  120: You are an apt learner. May your trials be light. Go in peace.
  121: As you see fit. May the future soften your heart and broaden your mind.
  122: Very well, I will teach you the ways to survive.
  123: You are an apt learner. May your trials be light. Go in peace.
  124: |-
    You do not convince me. I think you seek to use my gifts for ill.
     Good evening.
  125: |-
    Ah, a student of the arts is a rare thing in this world. Perhaps there
     is hope for you yet. Each song is long in time. Which would you like to hear?
  126: In the Wake of the Shadow.
  127: The Ballad of Aires.

  129: The Rising of Dawn's Chariot.
  130: An astonishing piece of work. I shall grant you an audience.
  131: I must rest. This teaching drains much from me. Good luck to you.

  138: I fear I have spent myself far too much. I am sorry.
  139: |-
    Peace and Beauty are all I can teach. I am sorry that those are not
     appealing to you. Good day.
  140: I can teach you the ways of the old bards and minstrels.
  141: I would be honored to hear a song.
  142: Perhaps another time. Thank you.
  143: I was hoping to learn something that may help me more.
  144: |-
    You have no need of my talents. You have taught peaceful people the
     ways of war. I mourn for them now.
SALLY:
  100: You see Sally.
  101: Why does everyone talk to me funny??

  1103: That's here.
  1104: I dunno.
  1105: He Harry's boss.
  1106: Wimpy things.
  1107: Wimpier than ghouls.
DANWIFE:
  100: You see Dan's wife.
  101: I'm not supposed to talk to anyone.  Please see my husband.
  102: I'm sorry, you need to speak with my husband.
  103: You horrible man, why did you do this? You killed my Danny!
  104: You horrible woman, why did you do this? You killed my Danny!
  105: You see Dan's crying wife.
GDOOR:
  100: You unlock the door.
  101: You accidentally jam the lock on the door.
  102: You cannot open this lock.
  103: You were not able to pick the lock.
  104: The door is locked.
  105: The door is unlocked.
VREE:
  100: You see Vree.
  101: I'm sorry, you're disrupting my meditation.  Please leave.
  102: I'm sorry.  I'll come back another time.
  103: I'll be back.
  104: How could I know your schedule?
  105: Uhhh?.
  106: |-
    Don't raise your voice to me.  Do I have to have one of
     the Brothers teach you some manners.
  107: Sorry.
  108: Yeah, ok.  Whatever.
  109: Oh, I'm scared.
  110: Greetings. It's a fine day for learning. Can I help you?
  111: I know you're the Master Scribe, but what does that mean?
  112: I need some technical information.
  113: Uhh . . .
  114: I record the knowledge of our ancestors for future generations.
  115: Interesting.  That means you know stuff.
  116: Yes. I guess you could say I know, 'stuff.'
  117: What can I help you with?
  118: Go ahead.
  119: I need a water-chip repaired. Can you help me?
  120: I'd like to know more about the weapons we make here.
  121: I heard something about holo-discs, how can I read them?
  122: How can I prevent radiation poisoning?
  123: What's causing all the mutations?
  124: |-
    Speak to the knights.  Ask them to show you one of
     the latest laser pistols I designed.
  125: Thanks!
  126: I've got another question . . .
  127: You are not yet capable of properly using the sacred knowledge.
  128: |-
    Use your Pip-Boy 2000 to read the discs. Insert the disc into the
     reader. If you have the proper computer skills, you should be able
     to scan the data.
  129: Where can I learn the computer skills?
  130: Thanks.
  131: Can I ask another question?
  132: |-
    The Brotherhood has some automated courses that you can take.
     Here, I'll show you.
  133: Use this terminal to learn the basics of computer operations.
  134: |-
    You're not very bright, are you?  You're wearing a holo disc
     reader on your arm.
  135: |-
    You would need some anti-radiation chems. I have some. Take
     these immediately if you think you are near radiation.
  136: Thanks!
  137: Can I ask you something else?
  138: Don't drink the glowing water.
  139: |-
    Between the nuclear and biogenetic weapons used in the War, it's
     surprising we don't have more mutations. However, if we can hold
     out, everything will be ok.
  140: Why do you say that?
  141: You're right. We'll be fine.
  142: I've got another question . . .
  143: |-
    All the mutants I've studied have been sterile - they can't breed with
     another creature.  If we could clean up the mutation sources, we
     should be able to simply outlive the mutants.
  144: Sounds like a plan.
  145: Interesting theory. Any proof?
  146: I've got another question . . .
  147: |-
    Here, take this holo-disc, it's got copies of my autopsies on mutant
     corpses.  It clearly shows that no mutant could possibly reproduce successfully.
  148: Thanks.
  149: Can I ask something else?
  150: "I don't think I should tell you anything.  Perhaps later, if you\n prove yourself
    to the Brotherhood's cause. "
  151: |-
    I'm quite certain you're in the wrong place. Please leave, I'm rather
     busy.
  152: You will destroy the knowledge that can save the world!
  153: Yeah, starting with you.
  154: No. I'm stopping those who could bring about another nuclear war.
  155: Never! The Brotherhood will see that it never happens again!
  156: That's what they all say . . . except you. You'll be dead.
  157: What can I help you with?
  158: I've got some important news to tell you about Kedrick. He's a traitor.
  159: What you would do if there was corruption within the Brotherhood.
  160: Nuhh. Nuh-uh-nuh!
  161: Very good. I really can tell the lessons have helped.
  162: |-
    Kedrick? He's been a loyal member of the Brotherhood forever. I
     doubt you would even know what that means.
  163: |-
    Yeah, I do. Kedrick is a traitor and planning to overthrow your
     leaders.
  164: Maybe so.
  165: You're certain of this? Perhaps we should go talk to the High Elder.
  166: |-
    Do not bother me with innuendo. Bring proof to the High Elder, or
     say nothing of this.
  167: |-
    Do what must be done. Stamp out the heresy and remove those
     responsible for the stain.
  168: Even if it was a trusted member of the Brotherhood.
  169: And who would do the removal?
  170: Even so.  But proof would have to be offered.
  171: Kedrick is a traitor. He is planning on killing the Elders.
  172: I'll get the proof.
  173: |-
    Then we must go to the High Elder. Bring your proof and we'll go
     talk to him.
  174: The High Elder and Rhombus, of course.
  175: Did you hear about the missing Initiate? This is terrible!
  176: I agree.
  177: Nuh-huh.
  178: If you can help him, I would be most grateful.
  179: |-
    Good deeds should be rewarded. For helping the Initiate, please take
     these.
  180: Oh, it's you. What do you want?
  181: I came to apologize.
  182: Sorry, wrong room.
  183: 'Thank you for your apology. '
  184: Good day.
  185: |-
    That sounds like a manufacturing problem. We handle theory and design
     only. Have one of the knights help you out.
  186: Thanks anyway.
  187: Can I ask something else?
  188: |-
    Please talk to one of the other scribes. I'm trying to finish up
     reports for the other Elders.
  189: |-
    I don't know anything about that. But it sounds like something I
     should research.
  190: |-
    Sorry, not one of my specialties. Maybe one of the other Brothers
     would know.
  191: Guards! Guards!
  192: You've destroyed my room!
  193: What do you think you're doing with my things?
  194: |-
    Who? Wait, that name sounds a familiar. Perhaps he is a leader
     of some of the mutants.
  195: |-
    I assume you're referring to the last nuclear war. The Brotherhood is doing
     everything it can to restore that which was lost.

    The only salvation this tortured planet and its people have.
     Without us, humanity is sure to perish.
  198: I don't know. Ask Manufacturing about it.
  199: He makes sure the Brotherhood stays on the path of righteousness.
  200: He enforces the High Elder's wishes. With force, if necessary.
  300: Interesting.
  301: Okay, that should do it.
  302: This should correct that.
  303: Good.
  304: I knew that was going to work.
  305: What was the formula again.
  306: |-
    The algorithm is wrong, that can't be. Something must be wrong with
     the computer.
  307: Here we are.
  308: Okay, so if we do this... yes, I think it will work.
  400: You can use this terminal to increase your Computer Skills.

    Uh.. yes I do. The master is having me scout around in disguise
     to check our security.

  107: Okay, I'm leaving.
  108: huh.
  109: "(sigh) What do you want now?"

    I'm lost.. can you show me how to get to the master? I need to kill
     him.
  111: Nothing. Goodbye.
  112: |-
    To see what you look like with all your skin ripped off your body,
     you mutant scum.
  113: What's wrong with you?
  114: great oogly moogly.
  115: I'm here to... contemplate the oneness of the master.
  116: Of course. The unity brings peace. May I ask where you are from?
  117: |-
    I am as well. I made the pilgrimage from far away to see the master
     with my own eyes.
  118: I have much to learn. How does one gain an audience with the master?
  119: |-
    I did that yesterday. Today I'm contemplating what the master would
     look like if I lit him on fire and roasted marshmallows over his putrid
     carcass.
  120: I think the master is insane.
  121: I'm from... somewhere ..else.
  122: What a coincidence! So am I.
  123: Where?
  124: I'm from a vault... I'm a pure strain human.
  125: What, are you an imbecile?
  126: Where are you from?
  127: "(whispers) I'm from a vault... I'm a pure strain human."
  128: I'd rather not say. Goodbye.
  129: A small village to the north of here.
  130: Why should I tell you? You're just a lackey for the 'Man'.
  131: Why would you tell me that? I should take you before the master...
  132: But you won't
  133: You're welcome to try.
  134: Well, I should shove my gun down your throat and pull the trigger!
  135: Please don't.
  136: I know why you're in so much pain.
  137: I'll be going now.
  138: You're right... if only I could clear my head. There's something...
  139: I know why you can't clear your head.
  140: |-
    The master keeps you from thinking clearly. Thinking disturbs the
     unity.
  141: The master is the reason you are in such pain.
  142: |-
    Hey, I've got an idea - let's cut open the master and see what's
     inside!!!
  143: Tell me! Please!!
  144: |-
    You used to be human, too. The master dipped you in the FEV virus and
     mutated you.
  145: Sorry, I can't.
  146: Only the master can tell you everything.
  147: |-
    Only the master can tell you everything. But you'd better talk to him
     quick, 'cause I'm on my way to kill him.
  148: Sorry, got to go.
  149: I should kill you for taunting me!
  150: |-
    I have a better idea - help me destroy the master for doing this to
     you.
  151: |-
    No, you should kill the master for doing this to you. I'm on my way
     to do just that... would you like to join me?
  152: Why? I'm not the one who turned you into a mutant!
  153: You're welcome to try.
  154: No thanks. Bye!
  155: Let's twist his head until his eyes pop out.
  156: You will never kill the master. He cannot die.
  157: You're right. I'd better get out of here.
  158: We'll see about that.
  159: Hmmm. I wonder how he'll continue to live when his unity is destroyed...
  160: That can't be.. the master.. protects... unifies...
  161: |-
    Well, you're a living example of 'unification', my friend. I know,
     I've seen the process. I'm here to stop the master from 'unifying' anyone
     else.
  162: How does it feel to be protected and unified?
  163: Yeah, he protects himself by controlling everyone else.
  164: I've had enough of this. Goodbye.
  165: Leave now or I will be forced to deal with you.
  166: AAAUGH!!! (Grabs his head in pain and confusion) I.. can't...
  167: |-
    That's right, your friend the master stripped you of everything
     you had in this world, including your humanity.
  168: |-
    You know that it's true... that's why you're so confused. You're
     fighting the mutation. Help me avenge you by destroying the master!
  169: Sure you can. C'mon, let's kill the master, it will be fun.
  170: I'd better leave.
  171: I'm sorry you're in such pain, but it's the master's fault.
  172: |-
    I will pull his eye out!! I'll tear his slimy little head from
     its cables!!!! You, ...get out of here... I'll take care of the master.
  173: Great!!
  174: |-
    Thanks for the offer, but I'd like to do the job myself. Would
     you like to help?
  175: I'm going to stay here. I have some unfinished business.

  109: The door is already unlocked.
  110: The lock is beyond your ability to pick.
  200: There is no lock on this door to pick.
  201: You notice some irregularities in the wall.
CHUCK:
  100: You see a dark-skinned man adorned with bright scarves and trinkets.
  101: You see Chuck, the gypsy fortune-teller.
  102: Hello, stranger. May I be of service?
  103: Uugh!
  104: I'm just looking around, thanks.
  105: I'm getting to know the people of Adytum.
  106: Why do you assume that I need something?
  107: Hmm. Don't worry, my simple friend, you have great things ahead.
  108: And what do you think of our town?
  109: It's okay.
  110: Don't like it much. Not too friendly.
  111: You've done remarkably well, considering the hostile circumstances.
  112: I'm called Chuck. Welcome to Adytum. I'm afraid that most of the people here
    aren't too forthcoming with strangers, though.
  113: Yeah, I noticed.
  114: So, what's your job, Chuck?
  115: See you around, Chuck.
  116: Good journeys, wanderer.
  117: We all need something, don't we? And you wouldn't have talked to me if you
    didn't want something, whether information, conversation, or perhaps guidance.
    I can tell that you've been through a lot. What do you need?
  118: Uh, I don't need anything, thanks.
  119: Now that you mention it, perhaps you can give me some advice.
  120: "[Chuck pulls out a set of Tarot cards.] Let me consult the cards. [Chuck shuffles
    the cards.]"
  121: "[Chuck pulls out a card with a picture of a man in a lab coat with a computer
    in one hand, and a card with a man in power armor.] The Heirophant and the Prince
    of Wands in the south . . . great wisdom and nobility await in a place to the
    south."
  122: "[Chuck pulls out a card with a picture of a man with a vibro-blade and a flag.]
    The Prince of Swords in the north . . . you must face a powerful foe far to the
    north."
  123: "[Chuck pulls out a card with a picture of a radio tower, and a card with a
    picture of a man in a suit with a scepter.] The Tower and the Emperor . . . great
    change awaits by the hands of a powerful leader. Whether that change is death,
    I cannot tell."
  124: "[Chuck pulls out a card with a picture of a man dancing on a nuclear warhead.]
    The Fool. I cannot help you; you must make your own way in the world."
  125: "[More]"
  126: Hmm. Thanks for the advice.
  127: Do you actually believe this stuff?!
  128: It works for me. If you don't want to believe then it's not for you.
  129: No offense, but it sounds like a load of superstition.
  130: Well, I guess we each have our own beliefs.
  131: If that is how you feel, then I suppose we have nothing more to discuss.
  132: Indeed, we do. And your universe is shaped by your beliefs, while my universe
    is shaped by my thoughts. We may not share beliefs, but I wish you well in your
    universe.
  133: It is home.
  134: Uh, yeah. See you around.
  135: Things do seem a little quite around here.
  136: I know what you mean. I've seen a lot of suffering.
  137: |-
    The Regulators make sure of that. The people of Adytum sometimes
     suffer because of their strict rules.
  138: I guess so. Well, see you around.
  139: And you're okay with this?
  140: |-
    Since I wish to stay here, I accept the Regulators as part of that
     which is Adytum. However, I do what I can to lighten their lives.
  141: You do not seem to agree with what they do.
  142: Is there anything else that you could do?
  143: The Regulators protect their own interests, and I must respect that.
  144: Yeah, whatever.
  145: I don't necessarily agree with that view, but can understand it.
  146: It's been good talking. See you around.
  147: |-
    Well, I'm only one person, but help in what way I can.
     I advise you to fight for what you believe in, but most of all, choose
     the fights that are worth fighting, and find the times when compromise and
     hope will win greater victories.
  148: Do you have any other advice?
  149: |-
    The people of Adytum have much to do in a normal day.
     They do not want their work to be found wanting at the end of the day.
  150: Yeah, well, whatever.
  151: Things do seem a little quiet around here.
  152: |-
    Thank you. It has been difficult. We lose people to the Deathclaws
     sometimes, and winters can be hard, especially when the Hub traders don't
     come. But we are surviving.
  153: Good luck.
  154: What is going on with the DeathClaws?
  155: |-
    They infest an area North-East from here, and can often take
     the lives of people given the task of trading with the Gun Runners.
  156: Hopefully you will find a solution.
  157: Yeah. Whatever.
  158: |-
    Perhaps. I think Adytum will be here. Instead of going to the world,
     the world must come to us, like you have.
  159: Hmm. I guess so.
  160: |-
    I'm a farmer. I also like to do a little bit of work on the buildings,
     restoring them and keeping them intact, and sometimes I give advice.
  161: What kind of advice?
  162: |-
    Yes, unfortunately. I think . . . it is a kind of crucible, that
     by surviving these hard times, we come to rely on each other and to learn
     the skills we need to survive. I think, eventually, mankind will be better for it.
  163: |-
    I don't agree.  I have come across many gangs and raiders in my travels.
     They've become petty killers and thieves. I think that we all risk that eventually.
  164: Perhaps you're right. Certainly those who survive will be stronger.
  165: |-
    They will eventually destroy themselves. And the people who will be
     left will be the ones who work together to survive, like us.
  166: |-
    I'm glad that some of the outsiders, like you, feel that way.
     We need to find ways to work together to build something new.
     It won't start here; we are too regulated, but it has to start somewhere.
  167: Hello. What can I do for you?
  168: Can I help you?
  169: Yes?
  170: Just stopping by to say hello.
  171: I'm looking for a little advice.
  172: May I ask what you do around here?
  173: Hello, then. I hope you're doing well.
GENMERCB:
  101: I do not need your services right now. Perhaps later.
  102: Help! Save me!
  103: You must die for what you've done!
  104: Spare me! Please!
  105: Are they dead yet? Maybe there's more of them!
  106: |-
    Your arrival was timely, my friend. Allow me to present you with a small
     token of my gratitude.
  107: |-
    Your arrival was timely, my friend. Allow me to present you with a small
     token of my gratitude.
MBOUT2IN:
  100: The door is locked. A security code is required to unlock it.
  101: You enter the code from the tape, and unlock the door.
  102: The door is not locked.
  103: You bypass the security code and unlock the door.
  104: You are unable to unlock the door.
  105: |-
    You are unable to unlock the door. This might be easier if you
     used a set of electronic lockpicking tools on it.
  106: |-
    The explosion is powerful, but did not even dent or mark the
     security door.
WIFE:
  100: You look distraught. Are you in need of assistance?
  101: I need healing.
  102: Urrr.
  103: My husband Razlo can help you . . . ask him.
  104: I'm sorry but I don't understand you.
  105: |-
    You will have to come back in the morning. Please let us
     sleep in peace.
  106: No thanks.
  107: No, I am not in need of healing.
LANCE:
  100: You see a weary traveler.
  101: You see Lance, one of the guards from Shady Sands' long-range patrols.
  102: |-
    Just stay where you are. We've heard about you in Shady Sands and
     we want no part of you.
  103: The only part of you that I want is what you're carrying. Strip down.
  104: I'm a man of peace, friend.
  105: Hey, didn't I save Tandi and kill off all your radscorpions?
  106: I have no quarrel with Shady Sands. I kinda like the place.
  107: Herung?
  108: I heard about you, and I ain't letting you kill me.
  109: I don't have anything to say to you.
  110: Yeah? What d'ya want this time?
  111: Would you know where I could find a water chip?
  112: Any sign of Tandi?
  113: Any problems with raiders lately?
  114: How are things in Shady Sands?
  115: Hnng!
  116: Hello, stranger. What brings you out in the wastes? Where are you from?
  117: I could ask the same thing about you.
  118: |-
    Sorry friend, but I get the impression that's a rather dangerous
     question to answer.
  119: Know any place good to get supplies?
  120: I'm from a Vault. Lucky Vault 13!
  121: Waaah?
  122: |-
    Hello, stranger. I'd recommend that you keep on moving, if you
     know what's good for you.
  123: 'Hello, '
  124: |-
    . I thought you were our friend when you rescued Tandi, but now I hear
     some real nasty rumors about you. Are they true?
  125: People say all sorts of things. Who cares?
  126: |-
    I ain't your friend. And if you make a wrong move, I'll spill your
     innards. You got that?
  127: What kind of rumors?
  128: Yeah. They're all true. Now strip down so I can take what you've got.
  129: |-
    Maybe I've done a few things I regret, but you should know better than
     believing that crap.
  130: |-
    . Am I glad it's you and not some raider! How's it going! I'm Lance, one
     of the guards over in Shady Sands. Sorry we gave you such a hard time when
     you first came to town!
  131: Hi Lance, what's up?
  132: |-
    Hi Lance. I used to be a nice person, but then life screwed me. Now strip
     down and hand over your stuff.
  133: Don't sweat it, Lance. What are you doing out here alone?
  134: Fine. But I'll remember this.
  135: Up yours.
  136: |-
    Spare me the idle threats, boy. I kill children like you in my sleep.
     Hand over your belongings, and I may let you live.
  137: If you really think I'm a threat, go ahead and kill me.
  138: Let's make a wrong move. I always wanted to see what my innards look like.
  139: |-
    That was then, this is now. What have you done for us lately? I
     think you better leave before I get ornery.
  140: We like it too. Especially when you're not in it. Now get!
  141: Man, you musta spent too much time in the Glow!
  142: I don't know what a water chip is. Sorry.
  143: It's an electronic device used in water purification systems.
  144: How's the radscorpion problem?
  145: |-
    The raiders got her. I'm part of one of the search parties. I think she's
     at the raider camp south of Shady Sands, but the Khans have the place sealed up
     like a fortress.
  146: Can you take me to Shady Sands?
  147: Can you take me to the Khans?
  148: We'll have to find a way to get her back.
  149: Thanks for the information. Good luck with the search.
  150: |-
    Uh, yeah, but we're handling it a little better since the Khans got their
     bloody nose. I understand we have you to thank for that. We're grateful.
  151: I wouldn't mind seeing a little gratitude.
  152: Thanks. Anything else I can do?
  153: Let me know if they bother you again.
  154: We're doing okay.
  155: Are you sure about that?
  156: That's great.
  157: I haven't a clue. Idiot.
  158: |-
    Okay, I'll trust you. I'm from Shady Sands. We're a community not far from
     here.
  159: Could you take me there?
  160: What's the town like?
  161: Any water chips there?
  162: Sounds like a nice place.
  163: Well, you keep your secrets, I'll keep mine. Good bye.
  164: Maybe it is. A pity, though.
  165: |-
    I've been to Junktown. I think it's southwest of here, but I've been
     traveling for so many days it's hard to tell.
  166: |-
    Yeah, right. All the Vaults were destroyed, as far as I know. Tell me
     another one.
  167: That's not what I was asking . . . oh, never mind!
  168: |-
    That's not an answer. They call you assassin, thief, grave-robber. They
     say you'll kill anyone who gets in your path. Is it true?
  169: Well, I haven't killed you yet, so obviously someone's lying.
  170: Pretty much. I've had my share of good times.
  171: |-
    I've made my share of enemies. I've left enough of them alive to slander
     me.
  172: I've killed quite a few people, yeah. I always had a reason.
  173: |-
    They call you assassin, thief, grave-robber. They say you'll kill anyone
     who gets in your path. Is it true?
  174: |-
    Okay, I'll do it. But if you keep acting like a raider, you'll die like
     a raider.
  175: |-
    I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, for now. But a man's only as good
     as his reputation, and yours could use some work. I hope you'll do something
     about it before we meet again.
  176: Just heading back to town. You wanna come along? I could use the company.
  177: Sure.
  178: Not today.
  179: |-
    A little bit of scavenging. We've found a few abandoned raider bases that
     haven't been picked clean; I suspect they've been attacking each other. We can
     always use more ammo and chems.
  180: I'm going to regret this.
  181: Get out of my sight before I come to my senses.
  182: |-
    We're still seeing a few; they must be migrating from the high desert or
     the Glow. But it's a lot better now than it was last year, thanks to you.
  183: Sounds good. Bye.
  184: Sure. Let's go.
  185: Man, I must be out of my mind. But I'll take you. Let's go.
  186: Have a good suicide, friend. And for what it's worth, good luck.
  187: I'm heading out. You take care of yourself.
  188: Well, I don't have much, but what's mine is yours.
  189: Not that I can think of. I'm heading out. You take care of yourself.
  190: We will. I'm heading out. You take care of yourself.
  191: Well, okay. Let's go.
  192: |-
    I won't lead a possible enemy home. If you do make your way to Shady Sands,
     keep your nose clean.
  193: |-
    Small. We make our living herding Brahmin. It's pretty rough country
     around here, and pasture land is rather precious.
  194: |-
    In a Brahmin herding backwater? You've gotta be crazy! There's probably
     not a working piece of electronics within two hundred miles.
  195: |-
    You got a point. I think we should play things cautious and go our
     separate ways. If I were you, I'd do something about those stories. Unless you
     like people hating and mistrusting you.
  196: I should kill you right now. You cross my path again, and I will. Now get.
  197: Let's go.
  198: |-
    Let me guess, someone told you about my snoring. Oh well. You take care
     of yourself.
  199: It is. Well, I'm heading out. You take care of yourself.
  200: |-
    Just you stay where you are. I don't know if you're in league with those
     mutants, but if you are, I'll kill you.
  201: What mutants?
  202: Who are you?
  203: What happened to you?
  204: Okay, that's cool.
  205: Ru-huh?
  206: |-
    The mutants overran Shady Sands. Must of use are dead. I guess it's only
     a matter of time before they get the rest of us.
  207: |-
    I don't care what you say, what you ask. We're all dead! All of us! And
     I thought the raiders and the rad scorpions were bad . . . they were nothing!
     Ha! Ha ha ha!
  208: |-
    Shut up! I don't feel like talking! Talking accomplishes nothing!
     Talking just bores the hell out of me . . .
YOURROOM:
  100: |-
    This door leads to your room. You have lived your entire life in this
     room, until now. Your fellow Vault citizens have told you that they
     will leave this room empty in your honor.
OVER:
  100: You see the Overseer.
  101: |-
    Ahh, you're here. Good. Well, only good that you're here. We've got
     a problem. A big one. The controller chip for our water purification system has
     given up the ghost. We can't make another one and the process is too complicated
     for a work-around system.
     Simply put, we're running out of drinking water. No water, no Vault.
     Now we both know we've had our differences as you've grown up. You've got the
     wanderlust in you - desires for things the Vault just can't satisfy. And you know
     I think this just might be the last safe place anywhere so I'm always worried
     about those who want to take off on adventures. Hey, if everyone left, I'd be out
     of a job!
     Seriously, this is crucial to our survival. And frankly, I think you're the only
     hope we have.
     You need to go find us another controller chip.
  102: There's a picture on your PIP to help you identify it.
  103: |-
    You have three months to retrieve the chip before the vault runs out
     of water.
  104: One month . . . two . . . four . . . five . . . six . . .
  105: |-
    You have two months, maybe less, before the vault runs out of water.
     We need that chip!
  106: |-
    We estimate we have four to five months before the vault runs out of
     water. We need that chip!
  107: Here's some equipment you'll probably need.
  108: |-
    If we didn't have to do this, I'd never ask. And if you don't do this,
     I don't know who else can. Help us. You're our only . . . chance, I guess.
  109: |-
    If you need help, come back here. Obviously, we'll do whatever we
     can. But we don't have a lot of time.  Be safe, find that chip, and get back here.
  110: |-
    We marked your map with the location of another Vault. Not a bad
     place to start, I think. Then again, what the heck do I know
     about the outside? I . . . look. Y' You know you're important to me and
     to . . . I-I really . . . just be safe, OK?
  111: You're back! And in one piece! How goes the search?
  112: Not good, but I noticed the radiation count is low. Why don't we just move
    the people out of the vault?
  113: I haven't found the chip yet. Can't we just make a replacement?
  114: Nothing yet.
  115: Nuh.
  116: |-
    Look, I know it's got to be tough. But we're counting on you. And
     we're running out of time. Please! Keep trying!
  117: |-
    Ahh, you never did listen to me. We don't have the necessary parts
     anymore. We've used up all the supplies required.
  118: Oh, ok. Thanks.
  119: |-
    We've debated this before. You ought to know now, after being out
     there! You think the rest of us could survive that?
     Besides, I'd be out of a job! I'm management! It's not like I know how to
     do anything useful!
  120: We agree on that.
  121: Well, do you have the chip?
  122: Not yet. Sorry.
  123: I still say we just pack everybody up and move out of here.
  124: No, but I have a lot of other things to tell you!
  125: Nuh.
  126: |-
    [The Overseer sighs.] Don't be sorry. I know you're trying your best and that means a lot.
     But you can't give up now.
  127: |-
    This isn't the best time to debate that. Get the chip, give us the
     option. Most of these people, including me, won't survive out there.
  128: OK, I'll go see if I can find it.
  129: |-
    We have no time, no options. I know it's a lot of responsibility
     for you, but we have no choice. We need the chip now.
  130: Please tell me you've found the chip.
  131: No, but I've seen some amazing things!
  132: Sorry, haven't been able to track it down yet.
  133: Nope.
  134: Nuh-uh.
  135: Well, keep looking. Time's growing short.
  136: We don't have time for this! We need the chip. Time's running out. [Sigh]
  137: |-
    Is there some problem, do you need more equipment?  Is there anything
     we can do to help?
  138: Nope, just going to take some time.  It's a big world out there.
  139: I could use some more stuff.
  140: Yeah, you could get off your fannies and help.
  141: Do your best. Remember, we're all counting on you.
  142: |-
    Here, take the last of our ammo and portable healing supplies.
     We're in trouble. Hurry!
  143: |-
    Do what? With who? Anyone else would be less qualified and have less
     supplies. It'd be suicide.
  144: Your choice. I'll do my best, but I don't know if it'll be enough.
  145: I understand.
  146: It has to be. If you fail, so does the Vault.
  147: Got it.
  148: Whatever.
  149: Good, then get going!
  150: Have you found the chip?
  151: Yes.
  152: Yes, but I think we should talk more about letting people leave the Vault.
  153: Nuh-huh!
  154: Great! Let me have it. We'll see if it works.
  155: Please, the chip!
  156: |-
    Okey-dokey. One moment, the chip is initializing. Here - here - here -
     There it goes . . . Self-test is green . . . re-boot is good . . .
     Hah! It's working! And it looks like we have a winner! Haha!
     [The overseer sighs with relief.] You -- you've saved us. You've done it!
  157: Ahh, it was nothing.
  158: You're welcome.
  159: |-
    Nothing? No, oh no! It was something.
     Don't downplay what you've done. You've saved a lot of lives.
     All right, now we need a report on what's out there.
     Please go to the library.
  160: Ok.
  161: |-
    You saved the Vault. You should be proud. But now, we need your
     report. We'll get it from you in the library. Please go there now.
  162: Ok.
  163: |-
    Well, you've certainly earned that right. But let's take care of
     survival first. Give me the chip and we'll discuss this when you
     give your report.
  164: Fair enough.
  165: I don't know.
  166: Oh, that's great! Can I have the chip, please?
  167: No, not that. I want the com-pu-ter chip.
  168: No. The chip.
  169: Just-give-me-the-chip!
  170: Thank you. Now, go to the library and rest for a while, ok?
  171: Nuh-huh, uh-nuh?
  172: Uh, nuh? Nuh-uh-uh-nuh.
  173: Yes, you can touch things.
  174: Oh, yes. You did good and I'm sure you have a lot to tell.
  175: |-
    I uh, I just wanted to let you know that the water supply has
     stabilized. Actually, we're rebuilding our reserves.
     You did great . . . I uh, I am a little concerned, however.
  176: About what?
  177: Huh?
  178: |-
    I' I don't like your reports. What was in the reports,
     that is. Heh. In fact, they scared the heck out of me. It's those mutants.
     I've done some calculations and, well, I've come to an unpleasant conclusion.
  179: What's that?
  180: |-
    [Sigh] The mutant population is far greater than could be expected
     by natural growth or mutations. This leads me to believe in -- I
     don't really understand it. But it looks like someone's
     generating new mutants. And at a startling rate.
  181: Say again? Without the confusion?
  182: Must be a lab somewhere then.
  183: Someone's making mutants!
  184: What do I need to do?
  185: |-
    Exactly! And as you've probably guessed, none of these mutations could
     have occurred naturally, even with the radiation from the war.
  186: What do you want me to do about it?
  187: |-
    As long as someone is creating hostile mutants at this rate, the
     Vault's safety is at stake! Find and destroy this lab as soon as you can.
  188: Ok.
  189: Once more into the breach, my friend.
  190: You have no idea how sorry I am to send you back out.
  191: |-
    Oh, yeah. Hmm . . . I' I' I' It's like this.
     There is a bad place where the bad mutants come from.
     It is bad. Vault is good. Please, go destroy bad place.
  192: |-
    Has the mutant laboratory been discovered yet?  Even better, tell me
     it's been destroyed.
  193: No.
  194: Not yet, but I've got some good leads.
  195: Nope, I'm a little lost.
  196: Nungh.
  197: Well, keep searching.
  198: |-
    Good. But hurry, the more time they have to produce them, the harder
     they'll be to stop.
  199: |-
    Well, based on the information you provided about
     population density, I think you should concentrate your search to the west.
  200: What news do you have of the mutants?
  201: I wasted the head SOB.
  202: I've killed the Master, the mutant leader.
  203: Nuh, ungh. Uh-nuh, nuh.
  204: Excellent! What about the laboratory? Did you destroy that, too?
  205: No.
  206: Yep, sure did.  Killed all the mutants and blew up their production vats. The
    vault has nothing to fear now.
  207: |-
    You should be proud of yourself for all you've accomplished. We
     depended on you and you came through. Now let's talk about your future . . .
  208: |-
    Are you sure?  Missing something would be deadly to the Vault. I
     think you should go back and check it out.  Try to the west, there
     seems to be a large concentration of mutants there.
  209: |-
    Go back out and find it.  It needs to be destroyed for the vault
     to be safe. Try to the west, most of the mutants seem to be there.
  210: What's that? You've killed the mutant leader?
  211: Uh-huh, nuh, huh. Nuh-nuh.
  212: |-
    There are still more mutants appearing? You need to destroy their
     vats? Great job! Go back out there and take care of it.
  213: What news of the mutants?
  214: I blew them up.
  215: The mutant vats have been destroyed.
  216: Nuhh!
  217: All of them?
  218: Well, all of them at the vats.
  219: Uh, nuh-nuh.
  220: What about the mutant leader? What about this so-called Master?
  221: Far as I know, he's still alive.
  222: Uh-nuh-nuh.
  223: |-
    He must be stopped. If not, he could rebuild his empire of mutants
     and would certainly strike back at us. The vault will not be safe
     until the Master is dead.
  224: Is the mutant leader . . . taken care of?
  225: No.
  226: He will be . . . soon.
  227: Nuh.
  228: |-
    I know this has been hard on you. But this Master's the type who'll
     rebuild his mutant army. Then he'll come for us. Please, go
     out and finish the job.
  229: |-
    Well, Th' Tha' That's great. That's very good. You sound
     like you're in control out there. Please, finish this up soon so that you
     and I can . . . When you're out there, remember, the people
     of the Vault know you've saved them.
  230: |-
    We can't have this. Not now. Not with everything else going on. The
     rules of the Vault are there for our protection and the survival of
     our species.
  231: |-
    What's wrong with you?! You turned against us?!
     I can not allow that.
  232: |-
    The water caravans from this Hub place have started to arrive. I've
     been running the figures and I've got some disturbing news.
  233: What's that?
  234: Huh?
  235: |-
    Oh, never mind. Just try and find the water chip. Get the chip.
     We still need it.
  236: |-
    The caravan water will maintain our current supply, but not increase
     it substantially. And these Hub merchants are charging us an arm
     and leg. This helps and we're thankful for that, but it's not a solution.
  237: Ok.
  238: There's something else, isn't there?
  239: |-
    Keep looking for a replacement chip. It's the only way we can
     maintain our independence and the security that comes with our seclusion.
  240: |-
    We're taking a terrible risk by showing these people the way to our
     vault. I understand your choice, and it may be what saves us. But
     I'm worried. Can we trust these people?
  241: I trust them.
  242: I understand.
  243: |-
    I'm sure you do, but we need that replacement chip for our long-term
     survival and economic stability.  We don't produce as many goods as
     we need to pay for this water, and soon we won't be able to pay.
     Find the chip.
  244: |-
    I'm sure you do. You must also understand our need for that
     replacement chip. Please keep looking.
  245: |-
    Please keep looking for the water chip. These water caravans are
     going to cause us problems in the long run.
  246: |-
    You've done it! That's . . . wonderful. Amazing! I'm so
     proud of what you've accomplished, what you've endured. There's no way
     the people of the Vault can ever thank you enough for what you've done.
     You've saved all our lives. Who knows, maybe even saved the human race.
     [The Overseer sighs.] That makes the rest of this even harder.
     Everyone will want to talk to you. Every youngster will look up to you.
     And want to emulate you. And then what? They'll want to leave. What
     happens to the Vault if we lose the best of a generation? What if we
     are the only safe place in the world? You just gave us back all these
     lives . . . I can't take the chance of losing them. I've made a lot of
     tough decisions since I took this position. But none of them harder
     than this one. You saved us, but you'll kill us. I'm sorry. You're
     a hero . . . and you have to leave.
  247: I don't know anything about that.
  248: |-
    It is a critical part that allows us to purify the water. Without
     it, we'll run out of drinking water.
  249: |-
    This is our home. We'd all be dead without it. If we care for it
     properly, it should last us for a long time.
  250: |-
    It was terrible. I hope we learned our lesson and we never do it
     again.
  251: |-
    How would I know? I can barely keep up with what goes on in here!
     I suspect you're going to find out.
  252: |-
    You gain 7,500 experience points for returning the water chip and saving
     the Vault. Congratulations!
  253: Here's a picture to help you identify it.
  254: |-
    You have one month to retrieve the chip before the vault runs
     out of water.
  255: |-
    You have two months to retrieve the chip before the vault runs
     out of water.

    You have four months to retrieve the chip before the vault runs

    You have five months to retrieve the chip before the vault runs
     out of water.
  258: |-
    You have six months to retrieve the chip before the vault runs
     out of water.
  259: Yeah, well I guess you'll have to find someone else to do your dirty work.
  260: I understand. I'll work harder to find the chip.
  261: |-
    You've done it! That's . . . wonderful. Amazing!
     I'm so proud of what you've accomplished, what you've endured.
  262: |-

    I'm sorry, but I can't let you in. Turn around and leave or I'll have to
     shoot.
  110: |-
    Look, it is my duty and my honor to serve as the night watch for Adytum,
     so it is my business. You turn around and leave, or I'll have to get serious.

  112: Try coming back in the morning.
  113: Oh, that's it. Now the gloves are off!
  114: Nghgh.
RATPIT:

VALTSTOR:

    This is the storage room. It looks emptier than you

  101: Hi there, stranger. Like my crops?
  102: Good morning to you!
  103: Good afternoon!
  104: Evening, friend!
  105: Nice day, isn't it?
  106: This soil is much healthier than it looks.
  107: I'm trying to save these trees and I think it's working.
  108: There should be a fertilizer caravan.  Now there's some money.
  109: Come on in, there's plenty of room.
  110: It's a little chilly out there; have a seat.
  111: Farming suits me.
  112: Did you know plants grow better when you're nice to them?
  113: I wish I had a little more land.
  114: Did you know there used to be large bodies of drinkable water?
  115: I've read about rivers. I sure wish I had one next to my fields.
  116: I wish the days were longer; there's so much to do.

  109: I'm not just anyone, you idiot!
  110: Oh well.  Goodbye.
  111: Ok.  Go on in.
  112: I know all of Mr. Hightower's associates and I've never seen you before, so
    you'd better leave.  Now.
  113: |-
    Oh, man are you in trouble!  Mr. H hates it when his appointments are late.  I'll let him chew you out himself.
     Go on in.
  114: You're not getting in here.  Beat it, skag!
  115: I don't want any trouble here, so you'd better leave now.
  116: Get lost!
  117: You're not getting in this door.
  118: What the hell are you sneaking around for?!?  Guards!!!

  117: Pretty well.
  118: Not so good.
  119: Ugh.
  120: Well, that's good to hear. Keep up the good work, I guess.
  121: No problem.
  122: |-
    We knew that there was no hope. I don't think we'll get a
     new chip in time. I think that some of us should move
     outside before it's too late.
  123: I don't think that's a good idea.
  124: Hmm. That might be best.
  125: Please hurry.
  126: Don't worry, I'll find the chip.
  127: |-
    Maybe you should come to one of our meetings. Theresa has some
     good ideas. We meet in her room on the second level, at five
     o'clock each evening.
  128: I'll think about it.
  129: No thanks. I have work to do.

    That's what Theresa thinks. She's got it all worked out.
     We're thinking of leaving the Vault soon.
  131: Good luck.
  132: I don't think you should leave just yet.

    Why did the Overseer pick you? It's obvious you couldn't find your
     shoelaces, much less a new water chip. Oh well.
  134: Urgh.
  135: Don't you have a job to do? Hurry and find the chip!
  136: Don't tell me what to do, loser boy!

  103: How about a little kiss?
  104: Why has your band of Raiders attacked Shady Sands?
  105: No, thank you.
  106: Hooroo!
  107: "If she is one of those women from Shady Sands, maybe you should look there.\n
    Now go, I need to finish sharpening my knives. "
  108: Kiss this!
  109: |-
    We do not attack those of Shady Sands. We are from the same place they are.
     It is only right that they share with us!
  110: But you are hurting their livestock and terrifying them.
  111: That seems fair to me.
  112: Uh, yeah. I think I will be going now.

    You sound just as wimpy as they are. Look, if they were in any trouble

    I am sorry, but I can't understand you. I'm sharpening my knives and would
     not like to be bothered.
  118: |-
    We give them the most important thing possible. We give their dreary
     lives excitement.
  119: I don't think they want your type of excitement.
  120: I think I will make their lives boring again. I'll start with you!
  121: Uh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
  122: |-
    I didn't ask. But since you obviously don't have any concept of fun,
     I think I will end your existence.
  123: Mocking me does not bode well for you. I suggest you leave my presence.

  105: Hnng.
  106: Okay.
  107: Why?
  108: What do you mean?
  109: |-
    I know you will do your best, dearie. Find Tandi, help her escape those
     beasts and return her to Aradesh. You will do this community a favor and
     build good karma as well.
  110: |-
    Aradesh loves his daughter very much. It is that love that makes him the
     man that he is and a pillar of this community. Without that love he
     would be lost, and Shady Sands would surely follow . . .
  111: I will do my best. Goodbye.
  112: I could use some help.
  113: Hmmm. We'll see.
  114: |-
    I feel that she is imprisoned. She was the target of hatred. That hate is
     very strong to the southeast. I'm sure you will find her there. Good luck.
  115: Thank you.
  116: |-
    You have not heard? Tandi is missing. I feel she was kidnapped.
     Aradesh is most distraught. This is a terrible thing . . .
  117: |-
    I hear that you have saved Tandi. That was the right thing to do.
     Your karma is strong. I have high hopes for your future.

  123: Why do you look so tired?
  124: Don't talk to me, old woman.
  125: You need more help than I can give you, child. May Dharma be with you.
  126: |-
    My name is Agatha. I am the storyteller of Shady Sands. It is my job

  129: It is good not to forget.

    I'm sorry, child, I am tired right now. I need my rest. Please come
     back later.
  131: |-
    How very true. [Agatha stares at you for a moment.] It is good for
     the young to remember, but it is very hard to act within the flow of history.
     Sometimes, the very course we take is determined by events long ago. May Dharma
     be with you. I must rest for a little while. Come back again, when I am stronger,
     and we will speak again.
  132: |-
    Thank you for asking. I'm just old, that's all. I cannot sleep at night.
     I close my eyes . . . [Agatha pauses.] But I get no rest. Please, it is
     just my old tired bones . . .
  133: I'm sorry, I'm very tired. Could you please come back later?
  134: Baba.
  135: Okay.
  136: Why are you so tired?
  137: I don't sleep well at night, my child. It must be my age.
  138: Good day, my child. You look well. You remind me of my own baby.
  139: Hng.
  140: I want a story, then.
  141: I'm glad you are feeling better.
  142: Thank you. Goodbye.
  143: |-
    You definitely remind me of my baby. When she was just a few months
     old, as a matter of fact.
  144: |-
    Thank you. Dharma always said that the farmer who plants politeness will
     walk easy when the season is over.

  116: You supposed to be tough or something?
  117: I'm sorry! Have a good day.

  119: Go upstairs. Others of my kind will judge the worth of your message.
  120: This is your last warning!
  121: Sure it is! Big deal . . .
  122: I REALLY need to speak with the guy in charge!

    Some people reported that their water had been stolen.
     They weren't given more water but some friends shared

     started guarding their water. A few days later
     someone knocked the guard out in the ration supply area

    elevator.'
SAMMAEL:
  100: You see Sammael, one of the Scavs from Adytum.
  101: You see a grungy man in dark blue clothes.
  102: Hey, I don't believe we've met. You are?
  103: 'I''m '
  104: "."
  105: Who's asking?
  106: Eruh?
  107: The pleasure's mine. I'm called Sammael.
  108: What do you do here?
  109: Nice talking to you.
  110: Nobody special. Never mind.
  111: |-
    I'm a Scav -- a scavenger. My job is to search out all of
     the Boneyard for useful items and information. Dangerous work.
  112: Why is it dangerous?
  113: How do you avoid the Deathclaws?
  114: Have you scouted out any of the other areas?
  115: Thanks, bye.
  116: See you around. If you see me. Heh.
  117: |-
    Well, you got the DeathClaws out there, and then you got the Regulators
     back here in Adytum.  Both ain't the most forgiving types.
  118: How do you avoid the Deathclaws?
  119: Have you scouted out any of the other areas?
  120: Thanks, bye.
  121: |-
    We only work at night, and we're good at what
     we do.  But I'll admit not everyone always comes back.  I sent a guy out
     last week to look for some parts for Miles, and we haven't heard from him since.
     The last transmission I got from him was that he'd found the parts,
     and was on his way back.
  122: I've done a little scouting. Who do you want to know about?
  123: The Blades.
  124: The Deathclaws.
  125: The Gun Runners.
  126: The Followers of the Apocalypse.
  127: The Children of the Cathedral.
  128: Nobody, thanks.
  129: |-
    The Blades are a pretty sorry sight for a group of people.
     They get by though, and some of them end up here in Adytum if they agree
     to what the Regulators offer them to do.
  130: |-
    Well if you haven't seen them before. They're mean as all hell,
     and like nothing more than to rip a poor Scav's heart out.
  131: |-
    I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades,
     but I haven't seen it myself.
  132: |-
    The Gun Runners moved into a big factory up to north-east not
     long ago. Can't tell you much because they have a moat
     filled with radioactive sludge, and you gotta get through the Deathclaws
     to get there.
  133: |-
    The Followers preach peace and tolerance. Nice idea, but
     impractical. They live in a big library to the north-west of us.
  134: |-
    The Children of the Cathedral are based out of a big church
     a ways to the south of here. There are some strange things
     going on there. I've seen creatures that can't be human
     coming in and out of there.
  135: |-
    And if the stories are right, the church is built over
     an old Vault, which Adytum's predecessors lived in.
  136: Heya. We see each other once more. What's up?
  137: What was your job, again?
  138: Nothing, thanks.
  139: Oh, I see. Right. Bye!
DAN:
  100: You see Dan.
  101: Help!
  102: "Why hello there, m'friend and welcome to the Hub. Let me introduce m'self,\n
    they call me 'Dan The Brahmin Man!' I wheel and deal with all the merchants\n
    around here, offer'n my humble services for a low, low price. So now, what\n can
    I do ya' for. "
  103: young man?
  104: my man?
  105: my little lady?
  106: I want to join a caravan.
  107: Uh, what services do you offer, exactly?
  108: Why the hell are you yelling at that poor kid?!
  109: Urg.
  110: |-
    Why, I manage the care for perddy much all of the Caravan's wagons
     and Brahmin in these parts. If they ever need anything for their caravans,
     I'm the one they talk to. Hell, the Big Three deal with me exclusively.
  111: Who are the Big Three?
  112: Well aren't you important.
  113: Really? That's nice. I want to join a caravan.
  114: Well, I got to go. Bye.
  115: |-
    What?  Get the hell out of here ya damn Skag! Ta think I was about
     to waist m'time on a low-life like yerself.
  118: |-
    Damn, son.  Have ya' been locked up all yer life in a cave or somethin'? The Big Three are the three largest
     Merchant groups in the world. Well, okay, maybe not the world, but they sure as hell cover a large portion;
     'bout as far as yer eye can see.
  119: |-
    Damn, honey.  Have ya' been locked up all yer life in a cave or somethin'? The Big Three are the three largest
     Merchant groups in the world. Well, okay, maybe not the world, but they sure as hell cover a large portion;
     'bout as far as yer eye can see.
  120: Damn yourself, you brahmin freak.
  121: Oh, them. I thought you were talking about something else. So how do I join
    a caravan?
  122: Okay, thanks. Bye.
  123: |-
    Bramin freak? Is that an attempt at insult'n me? I would be a little more polite to the people ya' meet,
     stranger. I could care less, but this city is filled with all sorts of cutthroats that wouldn't hesitate to
     slit yer throat if ya look at'm wrong.
  124: Damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch!
  125: I'm scared. See ya.
  126: |-
    Special, no. Lucky, yes; and unless ya want to be unlucky you'll be a little more polite to the people ya'
     meet. I could care less, but this city is filled with all sorts of cutthroats that wouldn't hesitate to slit
     yer throat if ya' look at'm wrong.
  127: Damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch!
  128: If you say so.
  129: |-
    Well at least I don't have a mutated hind for a face.  Yer mother must have been a brahmin and yer
     daddy a rat; that's the only way ya' could have come out so damn ugly.  Hell, yer uglier than me!
  130: No one talks about my mother like that!  Prepare to die!
  131: Yeah, not bad.  Well I got places to go and people to beat.  See ya', Dan.
  132: |-
    Yeah right, that's an okay line, but everyone uses it. Yer kiddin' right?
     Ya' wouldn't lay a hand on poor ol' Dan.
  133: |-
    Line? Hand? You wish. I'll lay much more than my hand on your soon
     to be dead carcass.
  134: Ha!  Had you going though, didn't I?
  135: |-
    Yeah, a little maybe. You're not too bad, kid. But just remember to
     keep that mouth of yours under control. I'd hate to see a good mouth go to waste.
  136: Sure, whatever you say. See ya', Dan.
  137: So, how do I join a caravan?
  138: Bye. And stay away from my brahmin, you dirty little bastard.
  139: Bye. And stay away from my brahmin, you dirty little bitch.
  141: Guards! Police! There's a Mad Man trying to kill me!
  142: |-
    Well, I don't have any openings but ya' might wanna check with the Big Three.  There's a job post in
     the Merchant Market that might be of some help ta ya'. That's where they, and others, get their men.
  143: Oh, sorry . . . and women of course.
  144: You don't have any openings?  Are you a merchant, too?
  145: Which way to the Merchant Market?
  146: Okay, thanks.
  147: |-
    Well no, not exactly.  I work very closely with most of the smaller merchant groups, though, and I know
     we're not hiring.
  148: Your loss.
  149: Okay, see ya' later, Dan.
  150: So where's this Merchant Market?
  151: Just go straight down this road.  It's smack dab in the center of the Hub --
    ya' can't miss it.
  152: That's none of yer business, stranger.
  153: I'm going to make it my business, 'stranger!'
  154: Sorry to intrude.
  155: Why, hello again!  How are ya' doin'?
  156: I want to join a caravan.
  157: Uh, what services do you offer, exactly?
  158: Why the hell where you yelling at that poor kid?!
  159: Fine. Bye.
  160: Yuk.
  161: What now?
  162: Why the hell where you yelling at that poor kid?!
  163: Nothing.
  164: Yuk.
  168: Look, that kid was caught stealin'.  The police put'm in my care ta straighten'm
    out.
  169: That's no reason to be so mean to him.
  170: What's wrong with stealing?
  171: Oh, that's different!  Give him hell!
  172: |-
    Are ya' daft? That's a quick way to rot away in a cell or get exiled without any food, clothing, or
     weapons.
  173: That still doesn't justify the way you're treating him!
  174: Oh, okay.
  175: |-
    I may not be the best role model in this damn city, but I'm the only
     one who cares and is willing ta try to help.  What have ya' done to improve society?
  176: I've killed lots of things!
  177: I'm sorry, I've misjudged you.
  178: You should have just killed the brat!
  179: Well, maybe you could be just a little nicer to him.  I think he's trying.
  180: You should give him a good whipping!
  181: Ya' think killing people solves the real problem?
  182: Yep!
  183: It's been working for me so far!
  184: Hmmm, maybe not.
  185: I don't know.
  186: |-
    You disappoint me. You seemed to have a good head on your shoulders.
     Killing them might get rid of the problem temporarily, but you've got to
     get at the root of the problem to really make a difference.
  187: Yeah, whatever.
  188: Uh, okay. Bye.
  189: You're an idiot.
  190: |-
    Well (he pauses looking off into space) . . . maybe yer right, partner.
     I'll keep that in mind but I ain't promisin' ya' anything.
  191: |-
    Are ya' kiddin'? That'd just make'm more defiant! My ways may not be
     perfect but at least I know it'll make'm stronger and more responsible.
  192: |-
    Damn straight. Kill'n the person with the disease isn't the best way.
     You've gotta find the cure because it's bound to surface again.
  193: No kidding, Einstein.
  194: Quit yer' yappin'! You're giving me a headache!
  195: Uh, yeah, sure pal. I've gotta go.
  196: Well, try not ta solve all yer problems with a gun. Bye.
  197: Damn, it's hot today!
  198: Billy! Ya' better not be screw'n around, ya' little shit!
  199: |-
    Billy! Ya' better make sure those brahmin are kept warm tonight or
     it'll be yer hide!
  200: Damn it, you little brat! Stop yappin' and start working!
  201: I told you to stop screwing around!
  202: I'm warning you, Billy!
  203: You don't want the hard way, do you?
  204: Sorry kid, can't talk. I've got a business to run.
  208: Sorry, can't talk. I've got a business to run.
  209: |-
    You'd better not be pester'n Billy; he's got a hell of a lot of work
     to do today.
  210: Beat it, I'm busy.
  211: Why are people always bother'n me?  Can't you see I'm work'n?
  212: Talk to the Merchants if you want a job. I'm not hiring.
  213: Why don't ya' go play in the Maltese Falcon? I'm busy.
  214: What the hell are you doing here?  Get out!
  215: I said get out! I'm not joke'n!  I'll blow yer frigg'n head off!
  216: Ya' punks will never learn, will ya'?
BOSLORI:
  100: You see the Brotherhood's Doctor.
  102: Hello, how can I help you?
  103: I'm injured.
  104: I'm radiated.
  105: Do you do operations?
  106: Tell me about the operations again.
  107: Ug!
  108: Are you injured? Let's see...
  109: That was the problem. There you go. Be more careful out there.
  110: Sorry, I can't help you if you won't tell me what's wrong.
  111: " You seem fine."
  112: There you are. I hope you feel better.
  113: There you go, but stop getting into fights.
  114: That should've fixed you up.
  115: Good as new.
  116: All healed up.
  117: Radiation is very dangerous; you should be more careful.
  118: I don't have the time for games.
  119: But of course, but it's very costly and time consuming.
  120: Details?
  121: Okay, never mind.
  122: |-
    Well, I can help make you stronger, more perceptive, increase
     your endurance, help improve your learning process, and
     increase your dexterity. Which would you like more
     information on? I can only do each operation once.
  126: Okay, which operation did you want to talk about?
  127: Strength.
  128: Perception.
  129: Endurance.
  130: Intelligence.
  131: Agility.
  132: Never mind.
  133: |-
    That's easy to do but there's a long recovery time. It only
     costs 2000 scripts but takes 3 weeks to heal.
  135: I'll do it!
  136: I'll pass.
  137: |-
    Now that's a difficult operation. It costs 4000 scripts, but
     the recovery from this operation is only a week.
  139: |-
    This one's not that difficult. It takes about a week and
     will cost 3000 scripts.
  141: |-
    This is the most complex and dangerous! It'll take 3 weeks
     and costs 6000 scripts.
  143: |-
    This isn't that tough of an operation but it is very costly
     and time consuming. It will take 3 weeks and cost 5000
     scripts.
  146: Okay, there you go. I hope the foam didn't irritate your skin.
  147: I'm sorry I can't help you if you don't have the money.
  148: |-
    I'm sorry, but you are an outsider. After you're in the
     Brotherhood for ten years or so I'll be able to do the
     operation for free, but we have expenses and you're not a
     regular working member of the Brotherhood, yet.
  149: Let me know when you have the funds.
  153: Did you want to ask about another one?
  154: |-
    Okay, here goes nothing . . . Just kidding. We can start right
     away. (She gases you and you slowly slip away.)
  156: |-
    So how are we feeling? (You can already tell the difference.)
     You're quite a talkative person in your sleep. You're free
     to go! Good day.
  159: |-
    Out with the old and in with the new . . . (You drop like a rock
     into an abyss.)
  161: |-
    You look exactly the same, but how do you feel? (All of your
     senses feel much sharper.) Well, you're taking up valuable
     bed space. Get going!
  164: |-
    I hope you have a heart . . . (She winks at you as you fall
     under.)
  166: |-
    Well, you look a little bulkier. (You feel great!) Well, let
     me know if there are any problems.
  168: |-
    Now where's the brain again? What's this thing supposed to do?
     (You try to fight the chems but it's a losing battle.)
  170: |-
    Well, it looks like I got it all back in and everything's
     running great. (It's as if the pathways of your thoughts
     have direct links to everywhere in your head and your
     memories are much crisper.) Take it easy.
  174: |-
    All right, let's give it a spin. (The chems, are so . . .
     friendly. Your slumber comes quickly.)
  176: |-
    Okay you're ready for duty. (You flex your muscles and can
     feel the increased speed and control.) All I ask of you is
     to please not damage my masterpiece.
  200: You see the Doctor's assistant.
  279: You should see the Doctor.
  280: She's the Doctor, not me.
  281: I'm only in training.
  282: I can't help you, officially.
  283: Lori's the Doctor.
  284: You have to ask the Doctor.
  285: Don't worry, she's just a kidder.
  286: She just likes to tease, don't worry.
  300: I'm sorry but this operation will not help you.
  400: |-
    Hmmm. If anyone here needs an Intelligence Enhancement, it
     would be you. In fact, I'll do it for 3000 caps instead of the 6000
     you would normally need for the operation. I can't guarantee that it
     will help you, but I think it would be worth a try. It will also
     take 3 weeks of recovery time. You probably don't understand this
     though, do you?
  401: Me want smart.
  402: No want.
  403: Are you radiated or hurt? I'll help you if I can.
  404: mE hUrt.
  405: hAir faLl ouT.
  406: No.
  407: Ok. You're awake. Let's see here. Do you feel any smarter?
  408: Hunh?
  409: Yes!
  410: |-
    Damn! It was a failure. Well I didn't have much to work with.
     Sorry, you're just an idiot and will most likely remain an idiot. We
     can only do the operation once, sorry to say.
  411: |-
    It was a success! I was able to increase your IQ to an acceptable
     level. How does it feel to have half a brain?
  412: It's great. Thanks, Doc. Bye.
  413: There you go. All better
FISHRSON:
  100: You see a lean and unkempt boy.
  101: I don't think I should talk to you. Go away.
  102: Why do you have a weapon drawn? We don't got nothing, not even fish!
  103: Hi. Wha'cha want?
  104: How's the fishing?
  105: I'm running a little low on supplies . . .
  106: Seen anything unusual lately?
  107: Want to hear about my adventures in the Rad Scorpion caves?
  108: Runk!
  109: |-
    Hi. Aren't you that person who goes around helping people? You must
     got lots of interesting stories to tell!
  110: Where do you come from?
  111: Hi there. I see you're not stupid enough to be fishing here. What's up?
  112: |-
    Not sure. Dad and I have been wandering the wastes for so long. We had a
     friend, a scorpion hunter with us, but he went nuts and we had to kill him, and
     then we . . .
  113: Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't talk about that.
  114: Tell me about your dad.
  115: What about scorpions?
  116: |-
    It sucks. Sorry, I shouldn't use the word 'suck.' Dad thinks that people
     who say suck all the time are either brain-dead simpletons or inarticulate
     losers. Dad's always trying to sound smart.
  117: I agree with your father.
  118: Sorry. I'm not the one to talk to about supplies.
  119: |-
    I saw a big thing like a giant spider with two heads, and one head
     looked human. Dad thinks I sucked up too much radiation. I dunno. Contaminated
     water does weird stuff to the brain.
  120: Yeah, like what?
  121: What's a runk?
  122: Sure!
  123: |-
    The worst thing about hunting Rad Scorpions is waiting for them to
     get into a good ambush spot.
  124: |-
    The worst thing about hunting Rad Scorpions is chasing them down after
     they run away!
  125: |-
    The worst thing about hunting Rad Scorpions is getting stung in the
     face by their stinger.
  126: |-
    Yeah. Did you ever hear about the raiders who fell into the Rad
     Scorpion nest and they all got stung and stung and eaten alive, except for
     the one who ran away with half his face chewed off!
  127: Man, that was a good one!
  128: |-
    Well he's kind of loud and boring, and I ain't sure he's my real dad.
     I think he musta stole me when I was a baby. But he feeds me most of the time,
     so I like him, I guess.
  129: |-
    They're big and they're nasty, and they're getting outta control. Dad
     said there used to be heroes who'd wander around the wastes and kill them off,
     but most of them are dead now, I guess.
  130: What kind of heroes?
  131: Yeah, adults always agree with each other. It's just stupid.
  132: |-
    Big Henry used to go with us, and he was better'n dad and me, until he
     went insane and tried to strangle me. Dad had to shoot him!
  133: Is your dad a good shot?
  134: Who's Big Henry?
  135: |-
    Well that sounds great! I'd better get back to fishing though, or we're
     gonna get so hungry, we're gonna have to eat you!
  136: |-
    A lot of heroes. The guy who founded the Brotherhood of Steel, Roger
     Maxim, he was a real good scorpion killer. When I get older, I'm gonna find
     out where they are and join them!
  137: Sounds good.
  138: It's really hard to join the Brotherhood. And it's a long dangerous trip.
  139: |-
    He's okay, I guess. Actually, I saw him hit a Rad Scorpion between the
     eyes at seventy yards, but it was a fluke shot.
  140: |-
    He was a guy from down south. Some sort of raider who tried to live off
     the land, not the people. He was a real great guy, but sometimes he'd go nuts,
     and one time he . . . uh . . . it don't matter.
  141: Yeah. I'm gonna be a he-ro, just like him. You bet on it!
  142: |-
    You think living like this is easy? I ain't scared of hardship and there
     ain't nothing safe out here, so I ain't quitting. I just gotta get old enough to
     strike out on my own.
  143: What about the battle between a Rad Scorpion and a man?
  144: Only about twelve times . . .
  145: Uh, yes sir.
  146: I think this time I'll catch a cold . . .
  147: Hurry up! I'm starving!
  148: |-
    It's been so long since you caught anything, I've forgotten what
     it tastes like.
  149: Dad, did you hear something . . .
MBSTRONG:
  100: 'off'
  101: 'off'
  102: 'on'
  103: 'off'
  104: 'Time left:  '
  105: " seconds."
  106: This is where you would be considered dead.
  107: 'on'
  108: 'Time left:  '
  109: " seconds."
  110: This is where you would be considered dead.
  111: 'Time left:  '
  112: " seconds."
  113: This is where you would be considered dead.
CHILD:
  100: You see a small child.
  101: Hi!
  102: Hello.
  103: Where are your parents?
  104: Erf.
  105: I dunno. Around here somewhere.
  106: You're funny!
  107: Hey, are you gonna kill someone?
  108: Yes.
  109: No!
  110: Erf.
  111: I'm gonna tell my mommy!

  101: You see a middle-aged woman.
  102: |-
    Hi, Welcome to the Library.  I don't think I have seen you around these parts
     before.   What might you be looking for in the way of knowledge?
  103: Good to see you again.  What might you be looking for today?
  104: What do you have in the way of books?
  105: I am looking for a Water Chip.
  106: Nothing, but thanks.
  107: Well, let me show you my selection.
  108: |-
    Well, in my studies I have come across some references to such things.  Actually
     I have in my posession a Holodisk that contains a certain amount of information that you
     might find useful.
  109: A Holodisk, what is that?
  110: Can I have the Holodisk?
  111: |-
    A Holodisk contains information on it, but it can only be read by a certain number
     of electronic devices.  I see that you have a PIP Boy. You can use that to decode, review,
     and store the information that a Holodisk contains.
  112: Sounds great! Can I have the Holodisk?
  113: |-
    Information is hard to come by in this day and age.  I will need to charge you 750
     Hub Bucks for the disk.
  114: Sounds good. Here's the money.
  115: |-
    Now that looks like a worn Holodisk if I've ever seen one.  I'll give you 500 for
     it.
  116: How about I take a blowtorch to this whole place instead! Huh lady?!
  117: Sorry, don't have the cash.
  118: |-
    I am sorry but I can only accept the full amount for the Holodisk.  Please return
     when you have that amount.
  119: |-
    I am sorry, but you wil need to keep your pyromaniacal tendencies to yourself.
     Please leave.
  120: "[Mrs Stapleton takes your money.]"
  121: |-
    You are right, the Disk has seen better days.  Since that is the case, I will
     accept 500 instead of my original price. [Mrs Stapleton takes your money.]
  122: |-
    Normally, I do not give in to such methods, but to protect my collection from such
     a threat I will give you the Disk.  In exchange, I would ask that you never return here.
  123: |-
    As I may have explained, you will need to use this and then access the information
     through your PIP Boy.  [Mrs. Stapleton hands you the Holodisk]
  124: You will have to excuse me, but I have research to do.
  125: Ruk?
  126: I'm sorry, I don't understand you.  Somewhere I have a Holodisk on learning
    the English language, if you're intersted.
  127: Goodbye.
  128: Thanks.
  129: Ug.
  130: Do you have a set of Chemistry journals?  Miles in Adytum said you might.
  131: Yes, I've heard from Miles and I have the ones he's looking for.  They will
    cost you 750 bucks.
  132: Here you are, sir.  Say hello to Miles for me.
  133: I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money.  Please return when you have the
    money.

  109: You are not wounded. That is good.
  110: I see you are poisoned.
  111: Hmm, some radiation poisoning. Unfortunately, we cannot cure that.

  124: Thank you, my daughter. Let us pray for your healing.
  125: There you go. Peace and blessings of the Children go with you.

     will heal you. Is this acceptable?
  127: Yes.
  128: No.
  129: If you donate all you can, we will heal you. Is this acceptable?
  130: Yes.
  131: No.
  132: |-
    You have more than enough to make the donation. You need schooling
     in math, my child.
  133: |-
    We are the Children of the Cathedral. We live and work amongst those
     unfortunates living in the wasteland. If you ever get to the Boneyard,

  134: Thank you.
  135: What do you do?
  136: |-
    We are the healers and teachers of peace. We heal the body to heal
     the spirit. All we ask is a small donation to pay for our healing
     supplies.
  137: Sounds like a good idea to me.
  138: Sounds like a load of crap, if you ask me.
  139: |-
    We did not ask you. I can tell you are tired of listening to
     our beliefs. If you need anything else, we will be here.
  140: |-
    It is the most holy of ideas. We are working towards ultimate
     peace in the wasteland. All creatures shall live as one.
  141: Thank you. Good day.

  155: Who at the casino do you owe this money to?
  156: How much money do you owe?
  157: Hmmm. Thanks for the info.
BARFLY:
  100: Hey buddy, can you spare some change?
  101: I'm tryin' to drink here!
  102: I don't feel so good.
  103: Man, I gotta get some work.
  104: Could you pass the peanuts?
  105: Not drunk enough . . .
  106: Jaeger . . . jaeger . . .
VASQUEZ:
  100: You see Vasquez, the mercenary desperado.
  101: You see a seedy-looking gunman.
  102: What do you want?
  103: Who are you?
  104: Hnn.
  105: I do not work for the weak of mind. You leave now.
  106: |-
    You have not heard of me? I am hurt! My name is Vasquez
     Villanova Hernandez Ortega. I am a famous desperado,
     my friend. And, if you have need, I am a gun for hire.
  107: Really? How much do you cost?
  108: See you around, maybe . . . good luck. Heh.
  109: |-
    Ahh, straight to the point, my friend. Excellent. I will help
     you around town for a measly $500 a week. My services are
     not cheap, but then again, I am worth it.
  110: Great, I'll hire you. Here's $500.
  111: |-
    Sorry to bother you, but I don't think I need your
     services.
  112: |-
    I am sorry, my friend, but I do not work for
     imaginary money. I need cold, hard cash.
  113: Excellent. I am yours. Let us go, this place bores me.
  114: Lead on, I am yours to command!
  115: Let us get something to drink!
  116: Where shall we go first?
  117: |-
    As long as you stay in Junktown, I am yours. I do not
     like leaving this town.
  118: |-
    Did you know that I have a bounty on my head?
     It is too small, however.
  119: Ah, my friend. It is good to see you again.
  120: I want to hire you for a week.
  121: Nice meeting you again.
  122: Hnn.
  123: |-
    Well, maybe it is not so good to see you again. Have
     a good day.
  124: |-
    Of course you do. My bill is small, and my worth is
     so large. $500, please.
  125: Here you go.
  126: |-
    You should not have done that, my soon to be dead
     friend.
HUBJAKE:
  100: You see Jacob, the arms dealer.
  101: Hi!  Welcome to Jake's.  I've got some great merchandise in stock.  Feel free
    to look around.
  102: I would like to make a deal with you.
  103: What are you selling here?
  104: What can you tell me about a water chip?
  105: Tell me about yourself.
  106: Nevermind.  Bye.
  107: wahnt.
  108: nO wahnt.
  109: |-
    I deal with high end arms.  The best stuff you can find this side of the Brotherhood,
     and since the Brotherhood doesn't deal with outsiders, I've gotta' say I'm the best.
      I have a Sniper Rifle, and you would be hard pressed to find Flame Thrower fuel anywhere
     else in the wastes.  On yeah... I've got a Geiger counter, too.  Very rare.
  110: Show me what ya' got.
  111: Tell me more about the Sniper Rifle.
  112: What would I need a Geiger counter for?
  113: Maybe I'll check with you later.  Bye.
  114: |-
    Man, you do like the rare stuff!  Where were you when I was selling some depleted
     uranium rounds a few years back?  I don't do chips, though.  Ain't a market in it.  Anything else?
  115: Show me what ya' got.
  116: Then tell me what you DO have.
  117: Tell me about yourself.
  118: |-
    Well, I've been around.  Used to be with the Union of Atomic Workers.  Sort of like the Brotherhood,
     but less friendly.  They wanted to keep to themselves, and I... well, I wanted to see the world and be my own
     boss, so I left.
  119: Let's see what you have.
  120: Tell me what you've got.
  121: What can you tell me about a water chip?
  122: Good meeting you, friend.  I may stop by later.  Bye.
  123: |-
    Ahh, the DKS is a fine long range weapon.  It was originally .308, but we rechambered it for the more
     common .223 round.  We tuned the barrel, too.  Most importantly, check out this trigger.  Smooth, huh?  The
     trigger breaks perfectly now.  Overall, this is a good choice for hunting any type of animal...
  124: Sounds good.  Let's see if we can make a deal.
  125: What would I need a Geiger counter for?
  126: Maybe I'll check with you later.  Bye.
  127: |-
    What do you need a Gieger counter for!? [Laughs] Though it's been 80 years or so since the bombs fell,
     there's still radiation around, you goof.  You can't see it, never could, but it's there.  Heck I'm willin'
     to bet you got some counts on you now.  Everyone that lives in the wastes has a few RAD counts.
  128: Show me what you have to sell.
  129: Tell me more about radiation.
  130: How does a Geiger counter work?
  131: |-
    Goof!?!  Do you always insult your customers?  If you think I'm going to buy something from you now you're
     sadly mistaken.
  132: |-
    Well, some call it the Phantom Death, 'cause that's what it is.  You can't see it, you can't hear it,
     you can't even smell it.  It basically builds up in your system.  You never feel it until it's too late.  The
     more trips you make to Hot Spots, the more it builds up and it will never leave your system.  Ever.  The Rads
     just keep building up.  Well... unless you can get a hold of some Rad-Away.
  133: Let's see if we can make a deal.
  134: How does a Geiger counter work?
  135: Where can I find Rad-Away?  I haven't seen it being sold many places.
  136: Wow.  You know a lot.  It sounds like you've been around.
  137: Thanks for the info.  Bye.
  138: |-
    It's pretty simple, actually.  You use it and it tells you how many Rads you have.  As long as you
     keep your Rad count under 100, you should be fine.  Go above 100 and you're in some trouble.  The worst part
     is you won't even know you've been sucking up Rads until a few days later.  Get over 1000 and you're cooked
     - unless you get a hold of a whole lot of Rad-Away.
  139: Let's see if we can make a deal.
  140: What can you tell me about radiation?
  141: I don't go for this hard sell crap.  See you later.
  142: Nevermind.
  143: "[]"
  144: gEt.
  145: Me go.
  146: Yes.
  147: No.  Just looking around.
  148: I don't want any trouble.  If you want to do business then let's do it.  If
    not, get out.
  149: gEt.
  150: Me go.
  151: Let's see what you've got.
  152: You can go to Hell.  I go where I want, when I want!
  153: I'm leaving.
  154: What the hell are you doing in here?!?!?
  155: |-
    I don't carry it.  Any I find I keep for myself.  Right up the street here, there's a guy that
     may be able to help you.  His name is Vance.  Don't ask too many questions of him.  Let's just say
     this is his area of expertise.  Just tell him Jacob sent you and he should do you up just fine.
  156: How does a Geiger counter work?
  157: Thanks for the info.  Bye.
  158: Here's what I've got.
  159: Bye.
  160: Thanks.
  161: Ook.
  162: |-
    The mutants wiped 'em out about ten years ago, so I guess I made the right decision.
     I eventually settled down here.  The cops don't like my trade and I've been rousted more than once, but I'm
     a helluva lot more honest than most of the merchants here.
  163: Hey, how's it going my friend?  Lookin' to buy somethin'?
  164: Hey, how's it going my friend?  Lookin' to buy somethin'?
  165: Your selection is good, but I'm looking for something with a bit more punch.  Any
    idea where I could go?
  166: |-
    Well, you might try the Gun Runners over in the Boneyard.  They'll probably have something to suit your needs.
     I've heard the guys at the Brotherhood of Steel pack some pretty powerful hardware too, so you might check them out.
LEMMY:
  100: You see a shifty looking character.
  101: Pssst! Come 'ere.
  102: So'a, whatcha doin' in the Hub?
  103: I don't really see where that is any of your business.
  104: Why?
  105: Looking for something that I need.
  106: Where my Mommie?!?
  107: Not really sure big fella.  I'll see ya around.
  108: Ahh.
  109: No sweat off my back.  Just seein' if I could be neighborly like. [Lemmy turns
    away]
  110: Well, you look like a businessman.  And I'm a businessman, and I thought we
    could, ah, discuss, ah, business.
  111: Well, what do you do around here?
  112: I think I'm just going to give you the business!
  113: I don't think I want to have anything to do with your "business".
  114: Well, we all got needs.  I might be able to help with some of 'em.  So what
    sort of needs do you got?
  115: Well, I'm really looking for a Water Chip.  I need to get one back to my people.
  116: Needs, huh?  I understand needs, but what might you know about satiating these
    needs?
  117: I have need of some information.
  118: I certainly don't need anything you might be talking about.
  119: |-
    I do a little bit of this, and a little bit of that.  I get things and information for people,
     whatever they might need or be lookin' for.
  120: Well, I do need some things.
  121: Anything you can tell me about specifically?
  122: I'm looking for a Water Chip.  You wouldn't happen to have one, would you?
  123: I'll see you later.
  124: |-
    Water Chip, hmmmm.  Don't think I've heard of one of those things.  If I's was you,
     I'd try the Water Merchants.  They got a grip on all the water around here.
  125: So what do you do around here?
  126: So what else might you know about?
  127: Thanks for the information.
  128: Not a problem.  If there's anything else you might be wanting, you come and
    talk to Lemmy first.
  129: |-
    So, you're lookin' for information, huh?  Being a respectable businessman, I gots overhead, so I'll
     need a few caps to tell you what you need to know.  Now that we got that straight, whattcha' wanna' know about?
  130: |-
    So, you think I might know a little more about those Water Chip things, huh?  Well, you might be right.
      It's gonna' cost you, though.  I think 500 bottle caps oughta' do it.
  131: Alright, what's the info?
  132: I'll give you 400 instead.
  133: I think you need to tell me, right now, and without the freakin' caps!
  134: Too rich for my blood.
  135: |-
    Now, now.  I wouldn't be the man I am if I gave information away for less than it's
     worth.  Come back when you've got the caps.
  136: |-
    Trying to intimidate poor old Lemmy, huh?  Well, I's not afraid of the likes of you.
     I'll just be seein' you around.
  137: "[Lemmy takes your money]"
  138: Well, that's fair enough.  I'll take that instead.
  139: Ok, Ok, Ok, see I was just kidding about paying for the info.  Good joke, huh?
  140: |-
    Well, so here's what I know about the Water Chips.  The thing I've heard is that they all used
     to come from the Vaults.  So if I was lookin' for one, I'd find out where the rest of these Vaults were.
     I'm not sure where all the Vaults are exactly, but I've heard that there are about 4 around here somewhere's.
  141: I want to ask you a few more questions.
  142: Thanks.
  143: Sure, what else do you want to know about?
  144: Anything you know about Water Chips that you can tell me?
  145: What do you know about Decker?
  146: Do you know anything about the missing caravans?
  147: Well, I'm looking for a certain commodity, if you know what I mean.
  148: Nothing right now.
  149: Now, normally I don't mind selling information, but you're not gonna' get anything
    outta' Lemmy about Mr. Decker.
  150: Ok, but can I ask you about some other things?
  151: Thanks.
  152: Missing caravans, huh?  Well, I might be knowin' a bit about those.  It's gonna
    cost you 300 caps, though.
  153: Alright, what do you know?
  154: I'll give you 240.
  155: I think you need to tell me, right now, and without the freakin' caps!
  156: Too rich for my blood.
  157: |-
    Well, I'm not really that sure, but what I's heard is that it ain't what everybody thinks.
     Some new guy is getting into the action with some kind of mutants or something.  But don't quote
     me on that.
  158: Figures.  Is there anything I can quote you on, Lemmy?
  159: Can I ask you another question?
  160: Thanks.
  161: |-
    Now, you might be insinuating that Lemmy ain't a stand-up guy.  Well, you's right.  But Lemmy
     is an ALIVE type of guy.
  162: Ok, forget about it.  Can I ask you another question?
  163: Well, I'm going to make you a lying down and not breathing type of guy!
  164: Forget about it.  See ya'.
  165: |-
    Stuff for needs, huh?  Well, I knows a guy over in Old Town that can probably fix you up
     with some stuff like that.  But you know what?  He needs to know who you are before you show up
     at his doorstep.
  166: Let me guess.  This "invite" is going to "costs" me?
  167: I can see where this is going.  I'll find him on my own.
  168: |-
    Exactly.  So I'm thinking... only for you of course... 1000 caps so youse can talks to this guy
     without him blowing your head off first.
  169: Alright, I'll pay your price.
  170: How about 800 caps instead?
  171: Because you like me so much Lemmy, why don't you just do it for free? [As you
    flex your muscles]
  172: Can't afford that.
  173: |-
    Well, what you gotta' do is find your way over to Old Town.  Over there is a guy
     named Vance.  Just talk to him.  Like I said, I'll let him know you're coming.
  174: You're all heart.  Can I ask you a few more things?
  175: Thanks.
  176: Sorry man, got things to do.  Nice chattin' with you, though.
  177: |-
    Well, you've come back to talk to your old firend Lemmy, huh?  What's it I can
     help you with?
  178: Well, you look like a businesswoman.  And I'm a in business, so I thought we
    could, ah, discuss, ah, business.
GUARD:
  100: Not scared.
  101: I'm scared.
  102: I'm on duty. Go away.
  103: Be good in this town or you'll answer to me.
  104: Got any donuts?
  105: |-
    Ever get the feeling you're being watched? Like you're being controlled
     by some distant being? I do.
  106: |-
    Did you hear what the Rad Scorpion did to Bill?  They're still trying to
     locate his legs.
  107: So you think you can handle a Rad Scorpion, huh?
  108: You don't look very tough to me.
WMCARVN:
  100: You see a caravan driver.
  101: Hi, if you're looking for a job on one of our caravans, you should talk to
    the Master Merchant.  She's in that building to the east.
  102: I'm sorry, but you need to talk to the Master Merchant.
  103: |-
    Good, you got the okay.  I knew it wouldn't be a problem.  She's so swamped lately, ever since
     Daren Hightower started hiding in his office.  Strange man. We leave just about every five days. That's
     the 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, and the 25th. We currently only go to Junktown and the LA Boneyard.
  104: So what's the pay?
  105: Um.
  106: "Our pay's 200 hubbucks. It's not that great, but we go out often and our routes
    aren't too dangerous\n and yes, like everyone else, that is for each way, but
    of course you don't have to go both ways. "

  114: No.
  115: Maybe.
  116: Yaya.
  117: Tae?
  118: Oh, okay.  Not a problem.  Just let me know if you change your mind.
  119: I wish you would make up your mind.
  120: Well, just stop by if you decide to work for us.  That's the 1st, 5th, and
    so on. Bye.
  121: I'm sorry, but I can't hire you unless you can communicate clearly with the
    rest of the crew.
  122: Please come back when you are feeling better.
  123: Uh, are you all right?  I think you need to get something to eat, but don't
    go to Bob's.
  124: I said get lost!
  125: I'm quite disappointed in you… stealing!  Now why did you do that?
  126: Cuz I'm a mean green moth'a from outer space, and I'm… ‘bad'!
  127: I didn't want to, but I'm starving and I have kids to feed.
  128: 'I''ll carve your heart out with a spoon! '
  129: "(Surrender)"
  130: "(Attack)"
  131: |-
    I tried to help you, but I guess some people are beyond help.  Sorry, to say this but we're going to
     have to do this the violent way.
  132: |-
    I understand, but that doesn't justify it.  I'm still going to have to ask you to leave.  We can't
     hire people who can't control their own temptations.
  133: Do you really expect me to fall for that crap?  Guards!
  134: |-
    I'm sorry, but sometimes a little cell time can heal a person.  Guards!  Try ‘not' to kill
     her. Will you surrender to my guards?
  135: I'll see you in hell!
  136: Yes.  I'm sorry.
  137: What? Are you going to get into another fight?
  138: I'm sorry but you must leave immediately or I will be forced to call the police!
  139: Guards! Police!
  140: I think you should leave..
  141: Sorry, but I'm not allowed to hire you.
  142: Please, you're making this difficult on me.
  143: Please leave.
  144: Intriguing, but you're not my type.
  145: Outstanding! The pay will be 200 hubbucks. Which route would you prefer?

  156: |-
    It's a tragedy.  We lost the whole caravan, but you survived?  That shouldn't have happened. I don't
     know what happened out there, but we can't hire you anymore. I'm sorry.
  157: Junktown
  158: 'LA Boneyard '
  159: Um, not right now. Maybe another time.
  160: Outstanding, I'll get the rest of the crew.
  161: Great.
  162: Off you go.  Good luck!
  163: Try to avoid trouble, don't go looking for it.
  164: Be careful, I don't like the looks of the Boneyard.  It's creepy.
  165: That's good. Those black walkways are really strange, but they're great to
    travel on.
  166: I think there are some gangs down there.  I'd be very careful who you talk
    to.
  167: Great.  Junktown's a decent place.
  168: |-
    Oh, say 'hi' to that… Kill.. again?  I forget his name, but he's a decent fellow.  I wonder how
     he's doing.
  169: Interesting place.  I hear they have some evil doctor that animates the dead,
    or something.
  170: |-
    Why on earth did you leave that last caravan?  Nothing terrible happened to it, but something could
     have.
  171: Can I have another chance?
  172: Nothing.
  173: I don't give a crap!
  174: Ig wa neeka rooola?
  175: Lig.
  176: |-
    I'm sorry, you've failed me again. You don't seem to be very responsible, and that isn't a very good
     combination for our line of work.
  177: Why should I?
  178: You shouldn't.
  179: Because I'm going to put a hole through your head if you don't.
  180: I had better things to do, than hang around some dumb caravan.
  181: I didn't know I wasn't allowed to leave. Everything seemed okay.
  182: I see… you where on chems.  Well, live that life if you wish it.
  183: I'm sorry you feel that way.
  184: |-
    I'm surprised you've never done a caravan before, but I guess no harm came of it… so, sure.
     I'll give you one more chance.
  185: You did a fine job!  Would you like another caravan?
  186: Sure.
  187: No.
  188: Maybe.
  189: Eeek!
  190: Lub.
  191: Ready to go?  We're leaving today.
  192: Yes.
  193: No!
  194: Ack!
  195: |-
    Otherwise I'll just give it to someone else, don't worry about it. You're not obligated…

  103: Follow me.  I know the way to the lair.
  104: Boy, I wish you had the guts to help us out.
  105: |-
    All ready to go? Once we get to the lair, there is no
     coming back until the job is done.
  106: 'Yes'
  107: 'No'

  109: Boy, I wish you had the guts to help us out.
  110: Follow me. I know the way to the lair.

    All ready to go? Once we get to the lair, there is no
     coming back until the job is done.
  112: 'Yes'
  113: 'No'
  114: |-
    OK, I'll wait for here. Let me know when you're
     ready to go.
GLOCABN:
  100: You see a cabinet.
  101: There seems to be an electronic lock on this cabinet.
  102: You easily unlock the cabinet.
  103: This lock seems more troublesome than you first believed.
  104: You easily bypass the lock on the cabinet.
  105: This lock seems more troublesome than you first believed.
  106: That skill does not effect the cabinet.
SHERRY:
  100: You see Sherry.
  101: You see a gang member.
  102: "[]"
  103: Who are you and what are you doing here?
  104: 'I''m '
  105: ". I'm new to this town."
  106: None of your business, wench!
  107: Puwah?
  108: |-
    Apparently so, since everyone knows that this is the territory
     of the Skulz. You'd better beat it before someone decides to hurt you.
  109: Bring it on!
  110: Sorry, I thought this was the bathroom. Bye.
  111: The Skulz? Who're they?
  112: Yeah, I knew that. I'm just hangin' out.
  113: Take off, you hoser, before one of us decides to tear you up.
  114: Sheesh, sorry.
  115: Yeah? Bring it on!
  116: |-
    You sorry thing. You should run along. It's not safe here,
     especially for someone like you who wouldn't understand.
  117: |-
    That's us! We're the meanest gang in town. Actually, we're the only gang.
     But nobody messes with us.
  118: So you pretty much have the run of the town, eh?
  119: How nice. See ya.
  120: |-
    Oh. Well, you'd better not. I mean, you're not one of the Skulz,
     and this is our place. So, you should get lost, before Victor gets itchy.
  121: Actually, I think I'll stay.
  122: Who's Victor?
  123: Fine, I'm out of here.
  124: Fine. It's your funeral.
  125: |-
    Victor's right over there. He's the meanest of us all. He likes torturing
     iguanas that he catches. I don't really like him, to tell the truth, but he's one
     of us.
  126: |-
    Well, there's Victor, and Shark, who hangs out at the Skum Pitt. Vinnie, too,
     and a couple other guys who stop by from time to time.
  127: Where's the Skum Pitt?
  128: Oh, the Skum Pitt is a sleazy bar north of here, near Gizmo's casino.
  129: |-
    You bet! Nobody messes with us! Well, except for Killian, but he's cool
     and all. He's like the sheriff man. We do whatever we want.
  130: |-
    We just hang out, and sometimes we play games at Gizmo's or have some
     fun over at the Skum Pitt. Sometimes we do odd jobs for Gizmo or for some
     traveler. Victor likes stalking people, too. Come to think of it, you might
     want to stay away from him.
  131: You work for Gizmo? What can you tell me about him?
  132: So what is it that you guys do?
  133: Who all is in the gang?
  134: Why do you hang out with these guys?
  135: |-
    We're like a family! We take care of each other. Well, except for Shark,
     who's always breaking things. And Victor, who looks at people funny. But
     Vinnie is cool. And we do stuff together. You know, we're like friends and stuff.
  136: |-
    Oh, it's you again! You know, it's probably not healthy to hang out here
     if you're not one of the Skulz. And you're not.
  137: |-
    Yeah, well, your Skulz probably couldn't knock over a sleeping Brahmin,
     much less take on me.
  138: What have you been up to lately?
  139: Really? We'll see about that! Victor!
  140: |-
    Not too much, actually. There's not much to do. I mean, Shark has been
     causing some fights at the Skum Pitt, as usual, but what else is there to
     do around here?
  141: Uh, not much, I guess.
  142: |-
    You could always try doing something else. You must have some talents
     or hobbies.
  143: |-
    Well, I do sort of like to draw. And Vinnie says I'm a pretty good cook.
     But I mean, hey, we have fun and stuff, you know?
  144: I guess that's understandable.
  145: |-
    But what will you do when you get older? Where will your life go?
     How will you make money?
  146: |-
    Um, well, I never gave it much thought. I mean, Vinnie and Victor make
     some money and Shark occasionally does some bodyguarding for visitors here.
     I don't know.
  147: You should probably get out while you still can.
  148: |-
    Hey, lay off! You sound like Vinnie's parents used to. We all support
     each other, okay? So back off.
  149: I guess. I never thought about it much.
  150: Hi! How are you doing? It's been a while.
  151: I'm all right, thanks.
  152: I've been better.
  153: Okay. How about you?
  154: |-
    I'm sorry to hear that! Perhaps you should get a room and sleep it off.
     Talk to Marcelles. Oh, and here, I can fix you something to eat, if you like.
  155: That would be swell, thanks.
  156: No thanks, but I'll see you around.
  157: |-
    Oh, I'm doing much better, thanks! I do some cooking now at the Skum Pitt
     and the Crash House. It gets kind of tiresome on some nights, but I do like to
     cook, and I get to meet all sorts of interesting people. And I get paid, too.
     Thanks for your help.
  158: There you go. Enjoy. And I'll see you around!
  159: |-
    He's this huge fat guy who runs the Casino. He wants to run Junktown,
     but Killian keeps him in line. He pays pretty well, though. Occasionally he
     hires Vinnie or Victor to deal with people for him, if they've been a
     problem, like one stranger who showed up here a few weeks ago.
  160: You want me to turn in my friends?!?
  161: Yes, I need your information.
  162: Sorry. Forget I asked.
  163: |-
    They have been hurting people, and they will go on hurting people unless
     they're stopped. You changed your life for the better. Now you have a chance
     to help improve the lives of others, too.
  164: |-
    Hmm. Well, I mean, they are my friends. But I guess that they shouldn't
     be allowed to hurt people the way they do. And I guess I trust you since you
     helped me. All right.
  165: |-
    No, I can't do that! Those are my friends! I may not be a Skul anymore,
     but I'm not going to turn my back on my old friends.
  166: I need your help. I need your testimony to put away the Skulz for good.
GENMERCA:
  100: Hello! What can I do for you?
  101: Who are you?
  102: What are you doing?
  103: Yeah, gimme everything you've got.
  104: Lub!
  105: I'm Lox. I'm a merchant.

  110: I'm on a trip to Junktown to do some trading.
  111: I'm on a trip to the Hub to barter my wares.
  112: I'm on a trip to Necropolis to do some exploring.
  113: Aack!
  114: Do you mind if I join you?
  115: Sure, come along. The company will be good.
  116: Sorry, this company is already full.
  117: Sorry, but I don't think I can trust you.

  110: You think that might be Razor.
  111: Whatcha want, loser?
  112: Err.
  113: I want to become a Blade.
  114: |-
    What would it take for me to get peace between you and
     Adytum?
  115: This! *smack*
  116: Nothing. Sorry I bothered you.
  117: I am just inspecting your place.
  118: Great. Another stupid one. You have the sound of a Ripper.
  119: Rrrrr.
  120: Arrrr.
  121: Arrooo?
  122: |-
    Don't like them much either? Maybe we can use you for a little
     'work.'
  123: Urroo.
  124: Un nah.
  125: |-
    Okay, talk to the head wench. Razor'll set you
     straight as to what ta do.
  126: Stupid and a chicken. I'll put you out of your misery now.
  127: |-
    So you are a Ripper! I'd be sorry to hear that, but then
     I already knew they were stupid. Goodnight!
  128: |-
    The Rippers. Those inbreds on the other side of town.
     Never mind. You're too stupid to know anything.
  129: |-
    You want to be a Blade? Good luck. But, if you can find
     Razor, talk to her about that. Maybe she'll let you get
     jumped in.
  130: Okay, thanks.
  131: Then I don't want in!
  132: What do you mean, 'jumped in?'
  133: Can't you just make me a Blade?
  134: Your momma never wanted you, and we don't either.
  135: |-
    Simple. You'll have to kill someone to get in here.
     She will tell you who you're gonna need to kill.
  136: Okay, thanks.
  137: Never mind. I don't want to be part of your stupid gang.
  138: No. I can't. I don't lead. I just keep Razor going straight.
  139: |-
    Simple. Slaughter our enemies, then we will give Adytum
     a break.
  140: Who are your enemies?
  141: Fair enough. Will you give me proof of this?
  142: Fighting is wrong! I won't do it!
  143: |-
    The Rippers. Those Gun Runners are just a pain, but nothing
     important. They are a  bunch of soft-sellers, anyway.
  144: Okay, I'll kill the Rippers.
  145: Never mind.
  146: |-
    If you plan on doing that, you may want to let Razor know.
     Otherwise, she will have your head before you get out of here.
  147: Suit yourself. Goodbye.
  148: |-
    I don't make the deals. I only make suggestions. Talk to Razor
     if you want to deal.
  149: Then killing you now would save you many years of suffering.
  150: Then inspect this!
  151: Get lost if you want to live.
  152: Quiet. We are trying to sneak up on the Rippers.
  153: |-
    If ya' got the head, take it to Razor. She still wants
     to play soccer. Otherwise, get out!
  154: Yo, homie!
ABEL:

  101: You see a large mutant.
  102: You are not supposed to be here.

  113: Abel take care of that. Then Abel kick yer ass!
  114: Children are not allowed here. This mutant place. Go away.

    Help!
  103: Would you like a flower, mister?
  104: Would you like a flower, madam?
  105: Empty
  106: Is there anything special about this place?
  107: What's so special about the flower?
  108: What are you charging, kid?
  109: Sure, kid!
  110: No thanks.
  111: Sure. I could get off on stomping it to pieces!
  112: "[sniff, sniff]. Smell nice!"
  113: "[sniff, sniff]. Smell yuck!"
  114: Silly! You already got a flower!
  115: Do you want the flower or don't you!
  116: I'll take the flower if you tell me a little about this place.
  117: What's so special about the flower?
  118: Sure, kid!
  119: Enough about the damn flower. Just answer the question!
  121: |-
    It's a Unity Rose. It's the color of the Holy Flame, and represents the peace and harmony we'll have
     when the Children of the Cathedral helps everyone in the whole world become friendly and strong!  Uh, do you want one?
  122: Empty
  123: Now how's a rose going to do all that?
  124: Tell me about the Holy Flame…
  125: How much is it, kid?
  126: Sure, kid!
  128: Look. I don't want your damn flower.
  129: |-
    It's free. We don't believe in money. The Holy Flame takes care of all of our needs! It's so wonderful!
     You should join us in our Cathedral of Happiness! Uh, do you want one?
  130: Tell me about the Cathedral…
  131: Tell me about the Holy Flame…
  132: Sure, kid!
  135: Thank you, oh thank you! I gave away a flower! Isn't that great…
  136: You're mean! I hate you! I hope you get eaten by the Holy Flame!
  137: They sure do! Have one! I gave away a flower! Isn't that great…
  138: |-
    You're stupid! I hope the Holy Flame kills you before you can say anymore stupid things. Mother Jain,
     watch out for the stupid man!
  139: |-
    We're the Children of the Cathedral. We've been commanded by the Holy Flame itself to feed the hungry
     and heal the sick. We're going to spread peace and unity everywhere…and everything will be soooo good! Here,
     have your flower!
  140: I don't think you want a flower at all. You're being mean to me!
  141: |-
    Roses won't do that, silly! Only people can change the world. And with the Holy Flame as our master,
     we'll be sure to make everything nice and special! So would you like a flower…
  142: Tell me about the Cathedral…
  143: Tell me about the Holy Flame…
  144: Sure, kid!
  145: No thanks.
  146: I'll show you silly, you little...
  147: |-
    That's the fire that cleansed the world, and if we obey it, it'll never do it again! It wants us be
     smart and peaceful and unified and stuff! So would you like a flower?
  148: Tell me about this unity…
  149: Sure, kid!
  150: No thanks.
  151: Enough with the damn flower!
  152: |-
    It's a wonderful place near the ocean, where people spend all their time praising the Holy Flame and
     being good. And everyone there is kind, except maybe Father Lasher. Uh…would you like a flower?
  153: Tell me about Father Lasher…
  154: Sure, kid!
  155: No thanks.

  103: Excuse me, Death-Hand. I'm sorry to disturb you.

  105: Aiyeee! A ghost!
  106: The dead walk again! The Death-Hand has returned!
  107: Well met.
  108: Hi.
  109: I'm waiting for Garl to crush Shady Sands. I want some loot.
  110: Welcome, friend.
  111: I'm glad that you could return for a visit.
  112: Unless you want trouble, you'd better put that away.
  113: Do you want to party?
  114: Oh, a tough one, huh?
  115: Garl Death-Hand loves his warriors. Put that thing away and go talk to him.
  116: So, you think you're tough, huh? Mess with me and we'll both find out.
  117: I don't like your looks.
  118: Go away!
  119: What do you want?
  120: I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Seen her?
  121: Nothing. Just looking around.
  122: Huh?
  123: |-
    Oh. You must be looking for a job. Go and see Garl in the big room
     and leave us alone.
  124: Then do it elsewhere.
  125: Nah. I ain't seen her. Why are you asking?
  126: Nothing. Just looking for a friend of mine.
  127: There is a bounty on her head. If I can kill her, I can get some good cash.
  128: You're lying. Where is she?
  129: Ah, OK.
  130: Really? What does she look like?
  131: About 6 feet tall. Blonde. She's from Shady Sands.
  132: |-
    Yeah, she's here. She's in the big house. You know, if we tell Garl,
     then he would want a piece of the bounty. You might want to think about that.
  133: |-
    You don't sound like you mean it. I think that you are up to something.
     And if you are telling the truth, then I'll bag the reward for myself.
  134: I . . . I can't say any more or Garl will kill me.
  135: Bite me!
  136: I don't like your looks. You'd better get away from me.
  137: What? Go away!

  106: Whose in charge around here?
  107: Ah, never mind.
  108: Dah, Cola, good?
  109: Well, then stop wasting my time.
  110: |-
    I pontificate on life a lot, and help the Blades understand
     the true meaning of Nuka-Cola.
  111: What's so good about Nuka-Cola?
  112: Is that all? That doesn't seem to help anyone that much.
  113: How much of that stuff do you drink?
  114: Can I ask you something else?
  115: Ah, ok.  I'll be seeing you.
  116: |-
    It is the stuff of life . . . Well actually, if I don't drink it on
     an hourly basis I get a splitting headache.
  117: So? [Dugan raises his eyebrows at you.]
  118: About 5 litres a day.
  119: Razor's the woman you'll want to talk to.

    Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Aspartame, Phosphoric Acid,

     as you stay on our good side
  102: Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.
  103: I like my boss.
  104: |-
    You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place,
     friend, and we want to keep it that way.
  105: Put what away?
  106: Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.
  107: Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?
  108: Uh oh.
  109: |-
    Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd
     better damn well keep them in your holster.
  110: Oh, sorry.
  111: No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!
  112: |-
    You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law.
     Put your weapon away, don't draw it unless in self-defense, and
     you won't have a problem with us guards.
  113: "[more]"
  114: |-
    Disobey the law, and we will return you to the lawless
     wasteland - dead or alive.
  115: Sure, since you put it that way.
  116: Bite your laws!
  117: Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.
  118: Fine, then. Heh.
  119: |-
    Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If
     you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right
     to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just
     cause. Have a good day.
  120: Thanks - you, too.
  121: |-
    Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on
     your head as a kid. No weapons.
  122: Dorf!

    Yes, Shady Sands is part of my normal trade route. You can travel
     there with us for safety if you like.
  108: Sure, sounds good.
  109: No, thanks.
  110: Oh, sorry -- didn't realize you were that stupid.
  111: It should only take a day or so. Let's go!

    Hello, I am Tolya. Looks like you just wandered in from

  103: ". What do you do?"
  104: Can you tell me about your camp?
  105: Urgh?
  106: |-
    As a raider, I explore the lands in search of new supplies. There have been
     some towns which have been graced by our presence.
  107: In other words, you steal from the people you visit.
  108: Hey, that's really great of you. I'm sure that Garl is pleased with you.
  109: What places have you been to?
  110: |-
    Come now, Garl tells me never to talk to strangers. You should
     at least be willing to tell me your name.
  111: 'You''re right. I''m '
  112: |-
    .
     Will you tell me something about your band?
  113: Look you idiot, I don't have to say anything to you.
  114: Go away, moron.
  115: |-
    We never steal. We just take the extra that others have and redistribute it
     among our hungry people.
  116: So, basically, you steal it.
  117: That sounds like a really great idea.
  118: |-
    I've been to many places in the wastelands. The closest places that I've
     been to are Shady Sands and Junktown. They are very grateful
     for the trips we make to them.
  119: You visit Shady Sands?
  120: Where's Junktown?
  121: |-
    You are starting to become annoying now. I think I will end
     that slight problem.
  122: |-
    We are the Khan, and our leader is Garl. We are the most feared
     group in the wasteland, and with good reason. We take
     what we want, and those who get in our way pay the price.
  123: |-
    Yes, we go to Shady Sands from time to time. It adds a little
     excitement to the lives of everyone concerned.
  124: What about Junktown?
  125: |-
    Why, Junktown is just a little bit to the south of here.
     Go a few miles, turn right at the dying cactus. You can't miss it!
  126: You also said you visit Shady Sands.
  127: Do not bother me right now. I am preparing for the next raid.
JCHIDMEM:

  111: We require a donation of $
  112: |2-
     before we can heal you.
     Is this acceptable?

     will heal you. Is this acceptable?
  125: Yes.
  126: No.
  127: If you donate all you can, we will heal you. Is this acceptable?
  128: Yes.
  129: No.
  130: |-
    You have more than enough to make the donation. You need schooling
     in math, my child.
  131: |-
    We are the Children of the Cathedral. We live and work amongst those
     unfortunates living in the wasteland. If you ever get to the Boneyard,
     stop by the cathedral.
  132: Thank you.
  133: What do you do?
  134: |-
    We are the healers and teachers of peace. We heal the body to heal
     the spirit. All we ask is a small donation to pay for our healing supplies.
  135: Sounds like a good idea to me.
  136: Sounds like a load of crap to me.
  137: |-
    We did not ask you. I can tell you are tired of listening to
     our beliefs. If you need anything else, we will be here.
  138: |-
    It is the most holy of ideas. We are working towards ultimate
     peace in the wasteland. All creatures shall live as one.
  139: Thank you. Good day.
  140: |-
    They donated this house to us, in order that we might spread
     the word and perform our duty as healers.
  141: Isn't Doc Morbid upset about this?
  142: That was awfully kind of them. Thanks.
  143: |-
    Whatever that heathen soul feels is no concern of the Children.
     We are here to do our duty, and it shall be done.
  144: Uh, gee, thanks. Bye.
  145: Why are you doing this? We will do you no harm!
  146: You do not have any condition that needs assistance.

    Fat chance. Now, get out of here before I send the night
     guard after you.
  122: My, you don't enjoy life much. I'll help you end it.
  123: You found me. Now, walk or die!
  124: I think I'll walk.
  125: I'd rather live.
  126: What's the word on the Rippers?
  127: They're gonna kill ya!
  128: They're dead. See?
  129: Nothing yet.
  130: Great. Go take it to Razor.
  131: Don't lie to me. Get out!
  132: Then get your butt out of here and can the bastard!
  133: Yo, homie! Nice job you did on the Rippers!
THORNDYK:
  100: You see Thorndyke.
  101: I do not use my skills to heal my enemies. Get out of here.
  102: |-
    I have heard about you. You are a ruthless killer. I will not heal one who has harmed so many.
     Get out of here.
  103: Sir, I am a healer. You have no need for my services.
  104: Madam, I am a healer. You have no need for my services.
  105: Tell me about your work.
  106: What's this place about?
  107: How much do you charge for your services?
  108: Maybe later…
  109: You know, I could help drum up some business. I'm very good at hurting people!
  110: Huh?
  111: Sir, I have already given you medication. I dare not administer a second dose
    now.
  112: Madam, I have already given you medication. I dare not administer a second
    dose now.
  113: Tell me about your work.
  114: What's this place about?
  115: That's pretty sad medication. Maybe you should find something stronger?
  116: Sorry to bother you, Doc.
  117: You know, I could help drum up some business. I'm very good at hurting people!
  118: Huh?
  119: Sir, you are injured. I can treat you if you wish. I am a healer.
  120: Madam, you are injured. I can treat you if you wish. I am a healer.
  121: Tell me about your work.
  122: What's this place about?
  123: How much?
  124: Go ahead.
  125: No thanks.
  126: I hate doctors!
  127: Oooo! Owwwww!
  128: Rarrrr!!!
  129: Sir, you are seriously injured. I strongly recommend that you permit me to
    treat you. I am a healer.
  130: Madam, you are seriously injured. I strongly recommend that you permit me to
    treat you. I am a healer.
  131: Tell me about your work.
  132: What's this place about?
  133: How much?
  134: No thanks.
  135: I hate doctors!
  136: Oooo! Owwwww!
  137: Rarrrr!!!
  138: |-
    The Holy Flame commands that I heal people. Its wisdom is incontrovertible, so I obey. I have already
     learned much about the world beyond the Cathedral.
  139: Tell me about the Cathedral.
  140: What have you learned?
  141: What's this place about?
  142: Sorry to bother you, Doc.
  143: That must be some flame!
  144: |-
    Sir, forgive me, but I have no patience for long conversation. There are other people who may instruct
     you better than I. Please, excuse me.
  145: |-
    Madam, forgive me, but I have no patience for long conversation. There are other people who may instruct
     you better than I. Please, excuse me.
  146: |-
    For me, sir, it is a place to practice the gift of healing. For others, it is a place where stray souls
     may be gathered and put on a productive path. Forgive me, but I have no patience for long conversation.
     There are other people who may instruct you better than I. Please excuse me.
  147: |-
    For me, madam, it is a place to practice the gift of healing. For others, it is a place where stray souls

  148: |-
    There were a few wise ones among the ancients who believed virtue is its own reward. That is my belief
     as well. Perhaps if more people shared this opinion, there would have been no need for the Holy Flame…
     Forgive me, but I have no patience for long conversation. There are other people who may instruct you
     better than I. Please excuse me.
  149: Farewell. Should you need me, I will be here. I do hope that you will never
    need to meet me again.
  150: |-
    This is a service, not a business. And your talent is not one which I would brag about. Now please
     excuse me.
  151: |-
    Alas, your injuries may be beyond my ability to cure. It is said that the Holy Flame can guide those who
     are cursed with idiocy and lead them to redemption; I shall pray for you.
  152: You are injured. Save the casual conversation for later… Please let me heal
    you…
  153: Not much for bedside manner, are you Doc?
  154: I'd really like to know about this.
  155: How much do you charge?
  156: Go ahead.
  157: No thanks.
  158: I hate doctors!
  159: |-
    I am a healer, not a moneylender. The Cathedral sees to my needs, so I might see to the needs of others.
     Now, let me see to your injury, shall we?
  160: Go ahead.
  161: Very good.
  162: Forget it.  If you were any more of a quack, you'd be swimming in a pond.
  163: I hate doctors!
  164: |-
    I recommend a few days of bedrest, not that anyone ever takes my advice. Now, get out
     of here.
  165: Your choice. I will be here if you change your mind.
  166: |-
    [Smiles.] Terrible people. I sympathize entirely. [Smile fades]
     I will be here if you change your mind. You are excused.
  167: I'll take that as a yes. Please don't kill me . . .
  168: OWWWWWW!! [SNARL!]
  169: |-
    Poor creature. A beast with your low intellect would be a challenge even for the healing powers of the
     Holy Flame. Get out of here…
  170: I'll take that as a "no". You are excus... uh… You go now. Go!
  171: |-
    It's a very beautiful place, although a little overcrowded these days. It's far to the south of us.
     We faithful gather to praise our master, the Holy Flame, and to pray for peace and Unity. Now, if that
     will be all…
  172: Tell me about peace and Unity…
  173: Where exactly is this place?
  174: So what's causing the overcrowding?
  175: I hate doctors!
  176: |-
    I have learned we are a spiteful, violent and stupid species, unworthy of the Holy Flame. I have seen
     greed and evil everywhere. And unless we do something drastic, we shall be burned by Holy Flame again…
  177: Tell me more about the Holy Flame . . .
  178: Your religion bites the Bone, pal!
  179: How many religions have promised that people will burn?
  180: Define "drastic" for me.
  181: I hate doctors!
  182: |-
    It is indeed, but there are others here who can expound on its glories far more eloquently than I.
     Good-bye.
  183: You are breaking my concentration! Do you wish to be healed or not?
  184: What are you getting so upset about?
  185: You don't look like you have much concentration to begin with!
  186: Go ahead.
  187: No thanks.
  188: I hate doctors!
  189: |-
    Peace is, as ever, forged by war and hardship, as is unity.
     Alas, my gifts will be needed in the days to come.
  190: Tell me about the war?
  191: Is Unity worth the price?
  192: Why does everyone think war is the answer to peace?
  193: |-
    Let me get this right. You're serving a religion that's planning death and destruction, and you don't
     have a problem with this? You're an idiot!
  194: |-
    The old world was filled with evil and decadence. The Holy Flame
     destroyed it. We can either fear the Holy Flame, or worship it and attempt
     to understand it. The Children have chosen understanding. Although we do
     not wish to see the Holy Flame unleashed again.
  195: How do you know what the old world was like?
  196: Worship? The Bomb? What's so great about a bomb?
  197: If the Holy Flame is so great, why don't you want to see it all the time?
  198: |-
    Let me get this straight. In order to understand something, you have
     to worship it?
  199: You people are nuts!
  200: |-
    When I ask someone to do something, I do not expect to be ignored.
     If you choose to ignore my wishes, I can ignore your injuries. Good-bye.
  201: Who the Hell do you think you are? Get out of my sight, you little thug!
  202: You've pried enough information from me for one day. Good bye, sir.
  203: You've pried enough information from me for one day. Good bye, madam.
  204: |-
    The Holy Flame is a metaphor for the death of the old world and the beginning of the new. It is the
     power of life and death. What is more worthy of worship than that?
  205: My gun has the power of life and death, but you don't see a screwball cult
    worshipping that!
  206: Maybe you're right. I'll have to think about it.
  207: Uh, well there's food, and sex, and a big gun… I can think of lots of things
    I'd rather worship!
  208: You don't get out much, do you?
  209: You're not very convincing, Doc.
  210: This debate has become tiresome. Please leave me.
  211: I still remember your insults, sir. You can rot in the Glow before I treat
    you.
  212: I still remember your insults, madam. You can rot in the Glow before I treat
    you.
  213: Mother Jain wishes that no one speaks with you. Good bye.
  214: Idiot. Can't you see he needs rest?
FISHRMAN:
  100: You see a weary fisherman.
  101: |-
    Sir, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my
     boy in peace.
  102: |-
    Ma'am, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my
     boy in peace.
  103: |-
    Howdy sir. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something
     I can do for you?
  104: |-
    Howdy ma'am. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something
     I can do for you?
  105: You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a water chip, would you?
  106: You wouldn't know anything about mutant armies, would you?
  107: Where do you come from?
  108: How's the fishing?
  109: Give me everything you've got or I'll kill you!
  110: Runk!
  111: |-
    Wait a minute, aren't you that fella who wanders the wastes and kicks the
     monsters' butts? Can I help you?
  112: |-
    What a minute, aren't you that filly who wanders the wastes and kicks the
     monsters' butts? Can I help you?
  113: I'm running a little low on supplies . . .
  114: |-
    No man's ever called me inhospitable, and I don't want to repeat what
     women call me, but I am trying to fish and I need absolute quiet to catch the
     damn things, so please try to keep quiet.
  115: Has anyone ever told you that you ramble on?
  116: Okay.
  117: I'm looking for information.
  118: |-
    Do I look like a scavenger to you? Well, maybe I do, but that's because I
     spend a lot of time in the Wastes trying to teach my boy to fish and be a man.
  119: |-
    I haven't done any scavenging in six years. Too many Rad Scorpions.
     A fella could get killed out there with all them varmints running around.
  120: |-
    About eight years ago, I sold some chips in Junktown. I don't know what
     they did. One of them could have been a water chip, though I wouldn't bet on it.
  121: |-
    Anyhow, I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep
     quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve.
  122: |-
    Mutant armies? Not in this spot. Just regular armies would be bad enough,
     heh heh.
  123: |-
    You know there's too much politics in the world. I keep telling my boy
     that these politicians can't wait to blow up the world again. That's why I'm
     living off the land, to avoid the politicians! Only way to live.
  124: |-
    Now that's rather personal information there. I've killed men for asking
     less, just ask the boy. But I think you look like an honest person, so
     I'll let it slide this time.
  125: |-
    Well, I've fished this place for the last five years and it keeps
     getting worse and worse. I think it's Skunk, the three-eyed giant catfish, that
     keeps scaring everything away from my spot.
  126: |-
    But I'm gonna get that fish, just you wait. It's getting personal
     between us, and only one of us is gonna walk away, believe me. I'm more serious
     than the Brotherhood of Steel about this.
  127: |-
    Now you'll probably kill me, but if I don't stand up to you, I'll be
     setting a bad example for the boy. See my dilemma? Why don't you just walk
     away and make it easier for both of us!
  128: |-
    I'm not walking away, and you won't be walking at all unless you do
     what I say.
  129: Shut up and die!
  130: Fine. I'll leave you in peace.
  131: Son, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.
  132: Miss, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.
  133: Try some of this.
  134: Try some of . . . oh damn, where did I put it . . .
  135: |-
    Well, I heard about a big Vault way to the East, and reports of a secret
     Vault somewhere down south. And there may be some chips in Junktown and the Hub.
     Hope that helps.
  136: |-
    I hate to be inhospitable, but I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd
     appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my
     boy starve. And good luck killing those varmints.
  137: |-
    Mutant armies? Just plain armies would be bad enough. I heard tell that
     someone's been harassing the ghouls over in Necropolis, but that was a while
     ago.
  138: |-
    Now that's a personal question. My mother's womb, of course, but that's
     a little too flip. I don't have a home no more. Me and my boy just wander and
     try to survive.
  139: I do know where some caches are stored, but that's my secret.
  140: |-
    Well, it's kill or be killed - the Law of the Wastes - out here, but I'll
     tell you what. You keep killing monsters and I'll give you some supplies.
  141: |-
    Yeah you are. But what the hell does 'runk' mean? Whatever it is, I
     hope it's friendly.
  142: |-
    Now I'm hurt. Here I go, out of my way to be neighborly, and you accuse
     me of rambling! Well! I don't offend easy, but you just gone and made me mad
     enough to nuke someone.
  143: Anyhow, why don't you just get outta here. Git!
  144: Thank you kindly.
  145: What do you want to talk about?
  146: I'm trying to find a water chip.
  147: I'm trying to find out about some mutant armies.
  148: What can you tell me about the Brotherhood?
  149: What can you tell me about the Boneyard?
  150: I'm sorry friend, I don't think I can help you.
  151: "'Runk' ain't the same as keeping quiet. Now shut yer yap and get outta here."
  152: Fine. Take what you want and get out.
  153: You really aren't very friendly, are you?
  154: |-
    You'll forgive me if I ain't more appreciative, but I think you should
     just leave.
  155: |-
    I try to avoid them if I can. Their patrols can be pretty nasty if they
     decide not to take a liking to you.
  156: |-
    That's down on the coast. I hear stories about gangs running amok and all
     sorts of things that I don't want the boy to see, so I'm staying away from that
     place!
  157: |-
    Now put that thing away before you hurt someone. A man can't have a civil
     conversation when there are weapons drawn.
  158: Son, there's nothing like a battle between a fish and a man.
  159: Son, did I ever tell you about the time I caught the giant eel . . .
  160: Son, don't talk back to your father!
  161: Maybe this time I'll catch that three-eyed catfish.
  162: Dinner's coming right up!
  163: There's nothing like the taste of a juicy fish on an open fire.
  164: Quiet son, you're scaring away the fish.
HCHDGRD:
  100: You see a guard for the Children.
  101: Phillips! Let's take this guy out!
  102: Get outta my face!
  103: What do you want?
  104: Tell me about your work.
  105: What's this place about?
  106: You wouldn't know where I can find a water chip?
  107: What can you tell me about a man named Decker?
  108: Nice weapon you got there…
  109: Uh… milk.
  110: I'm a hired hand. If anyone bothers these space cadets, I kill em. You got
    a problem with that?
  111: So you're a bodyguard…
  112: Who hired you?
  113: Anything interesting happening in the Hub?
  114: What are you making?
  115: Yeah. A big problem.
  116: No problem, friend.
  117: Something called a Holy Flame. Don't listen to this bullshit, it'll rot your
    brain!
  118: What's your take on this Holy Flame?
  119: Man, are these people ever stupid!
  120: Anything interesting happening in the Hub?
  121: Where did these guys come from?
  122: Water chip? Do you mean like ice chips? Up in the mountains, maybe.
  123: No, I mean the computer chip to control a water purification system.
  124: Not that kind of chip, you moron!
  125: Uh thanks. I think.
  126: You ever been to the mountains?
  127: |-
    Yeah, I heard about him. He's a real bastard, but he pays his bills. Phillips worked for him a few
     times.
  128: So you think he's a creep?
  129: Phillips?
  130: Would you take a job from him.
  131: Thanks!
  132: Yeah, this is the only one I'd want in a fire fight. What can I do for you?
  133: Where can a guy go here to get some quality weapons?
  134: What's up with these Cathedral guys?
  135: Where can a guy go to find action around here?
  136: You wouldn't know where I can find a water chip?
  137: What can you tell me about a man named Decker?
  138: Sorry pal, but I'm on duty. No small talk.
  139: Get the Hell out of my face before I kill you.
  140: Way to go, Rocket Scientist! Who else could I be, Doc Morbid? Jeez!
  141: The priest bitch. Who else did you think? Jeez!
  142: I hate to admit it pal, but I've been out of the loop for weeks. You better
    ask someone else.
  143: Room and board and not much else. These religious types are cheap!
  144: Then let's solve it!
  145: Fine. Because nobody likes a problem around here.
  146: It's gotta be a scam. Nobody's really dumb enough to believe all this religious
    shit. Could they?
  147: Yeah. It's a good thing that they aren't paying me to agree with them. Holy
    flame, my ass!
  148: |-
    I dunno. I can tell you one thing, whatever you can say about the religion, they're not amateurs. They
     came in and organized this place like clockwork. This isn't just another band of mindless zombies.
  149: Jeez, I thought only Vaults used that sort of crap!
  150: Watch your mouth, asshole. These people may believe in peace and love, but
    I don't!
  151: No problem.
  152: Nah. The higher you climb, the worse the radiation gets.
  153: Uh, if you like psychotic, stone cold ruthless bastards, then he's the man.
  154: My partner. The guy who's guarding Jain.
  155: |-
    It depends on how much risk you like. My life's been kinda busy lately, so I came here to lie low. But
     if you like action, sure. Just don't screw up or you're dead, that's all.
  156: |-
    I hear the Water Merchants are always packing the best shit. But people will say anything about the
     Water Merchants. It ain't here among this crowd, that's for damn sure.
  157: |-
    I been trying to get a good read on these guys for weeks. At first I thought they were fools, but now…
     I ain't sure. They're organized, and they've got a plan. I can smell it!
  158: I hear Decker's got some action, but man, it's shitty work and if you screw
    up, you're as good as dead.
  159: |-
    Water purification chip? You don't use well water? Good lord! I heard tell of a Vault near Shady Sands
     where you might find one, but that place is completely caved in. I don't think I can help you.
  160: Can't talk. The boss don't like it. Sorry.
  161: Hey, you!
  162: Hey! What do you think you're doing!
  163: Why the lock?
  164: Hey, I'm backing off!
  165: Can you give me a hand with this door? It's stuck!
  166: You saw me! Too bad for you…
  167: None of your business! Get outta here!
  168: Good! Now get outta here!
  169: Get lost! If you pull this sort of shit again, I'll kill you personally!
  170: We ain't supposed to talk to you. On your way, pal.
  171: Hey! What do you think you're doing!
  172: Why the lock?
  173: Hey, I'm backing off!
  174: Can you give me a hand with this door? It's stuck!
  175: You saw me! Too bad for you…
  176: None of your business! Get outta here!
  177: Good! Now get outta here!
  178: Get lost! If you pull this sort of shit again, I'll kill you personally!

HGENFARM:
  100: You see a farmer.
  101: I need better soil.
  102: I'm not hiring.
  103: I don't need more water, please leave.
  104: This soil is too hard.
  105: These stupid plants aren't going to survive.
  106: Why did I become a farmer?
  107: Those mutts better not be pissing on my crops.
  108: I hate dogs!
  109: I hate dogs! Uh, except yours.
  110: This isn't your home.
  111: What? Do you go around bothering everyone?
  112: What a day. I'm exhausted.
  113: I'll call the police.
  114: I'm tired. Please leave.
GENDISK:
  100: You see before you a Holodisk.
  101: 'Pip Boy displays: Downloading data from disk.'
  102: This seems to have been a disk with some type of entertainment upon it.
  103: The disk has been damaged too horribly to allow you to read anything on it.
  104: This disk seems to talk about some pass code on another disk.
  105: |-
    You see a small display appear and show the remnants of some World War
     II movie.
  106: This disk seems empty.
  107: You discard this worthless disk.
V13COMP:
  100: You use the door computer. The computer does not recognize your access code.
  101: You use the door computer. A speaker crackles to life.
  102: |-
    Sorry, but we can't let you back in right now. Uh,
     technical problems. Try again later.
  103: You see the Vault-13 door entry computer.
COMPUTER:

    This is a badly worn-out desk with a dusty, cracked computer
     seated precariously atop it.
  101: The computer looks badly damaged and unrepairable.
  102: Many circuits are fried from an EMP burst.
  103: It doesn't work.
  104: You slice your hands on the case.
GHOUL:
  100: You see the Ghoul Manager.
  101: Whatta you doing here?
  102: Searching for the remains of the future past.
  103: I'm an explorer.
  104: What's it to you, wormface?
  105: Dug-duh.
  106: Whad' you say?
  107: Nothing.
  108: I'm looking for lost technology.
  109: That's what I thought you say. Getta outta my house.
  110: |-
    Oh, nonna dat around here. Maybe uppa da
     temple or atta water place. Getta going.
  111: |-
    Ack! Donna you be exploring any my stuff.
     Getta out! I mean it.
  112: Donna be in my face likka dat. I runna dis show.
  113: Oh, yeah.
  114: I'm gonna take that face of yours and shove it up yer . . .
  115: Ack! OK, I concede. I leave.
  116: You no biggie to order me like dat. Take some of dis and shove it!
  117: I don wanna talk to you.
UTHERN:
  100: You see before you Uthern, leader of the Super Mutants.
  101: Normie! How dare you enter the confines of your betters?
  102: Huh?
  103: Scum like you could never be better than humans!
  104: Die Mutie!!
  105: Really? You claim yourself better, but what proof do you have?
  106: If you consider yourself one better than the rest, you run into the fallacy
    of over generalization.
  107: It's a wonder your race survived as long as it has. I will start with you in
    the cleansing.
  108: |-
    You only prove my point by using inane comments as such. I personally would not wish you in my sight,
     but my master would have words with you.
  109: Show me your master.
  110: Try these words -- Drop dead!
  111: Surely one of your intellect can see that such things will solve nothing.
  112: With pleasure.
  113: Are you claiming that talk will solve nothing? You are more foolish than I
    thought.
  114: Though you are foolish, I was referring to your manner of delivering words.
  115: Ah, the fool finally realizes something.
  116: Words will only do so much. This will solve more.
  117: I begin to think you may have a bit of superior blood in you yet. Let me find
    out for certain.
  118: He does indeed, for death shall be your saving grace.
  119: |-
    The simplest of proofs for you. I am smarter, stronger, and quicker than you are. Would you care
     for a test of my skills?
  120: No, thanks. I believe you.
  121: You forgot arrogant, stupid and ugly.
  122: Sure. Let's see what you can do.
  123: Good. Would you like a chance at gaining greater powers?
  124: You bet!
  125: No way!
  126: I'm not sure about this.
  127: Die!
  128: Then i will take you to my master.
  129: It almost seems a pity. No matter, this won't take long.
  130: Offered all the power in the world and still frightened. I will help you with
    your decision.
  131: Comments such as those only prove how much more intelligent i am than you.
    Now, you shall pay for your insolence!
  132: Do you accept credit cards, or only caps?
  133: Never!!
  134: Sorry, I'm a little low on caps right now. Can I get a raincheck?
  135: What? I think I can generalize this much -- you are coming with me now.
  136: How nice to see you again. I was told that you were roaming around here. I
    have orders to bring you in.
MACRAE:
  100: You see a strong, stout man with a bushy beard.
  101: You see MacRae.
  102: Hello Lad, what might you be looking for today?
  103: Hello Lass, what might you be looking for today?
  104: Ai, What else would you be looking to know?
  105: Who are you?
  106: What can you tell me about the Blades?
  107: Nothing, thanks.
  108: |-
    Well, I'm MacRae.  I help the Blades some against the Deathclaws and that Regulator bunch.
      Teach'em a bit about protectin 'emselves against those nasties.
  109: What kind of stuff do you teach them?
  110: Have you seen the Deathclaws?
  111: What's the deal with the Regulators
  112: Can I ask you something else?
  113: "Well m' specialty is fightin with my fists, and takin a punch or two more
    than \nthe guy throwin 'em at me."
  114: Sounds like a dumb idea, I'd rather use a gun.
  115: Do you think you could teach me anything?
  116: Can I ask you something else?
  117: Well if that's how you be feeling, you can just turn yourself around and walk
    away.
  118: "You seem to be an alright lad, but me times busy with keeping the Blades schooled.
    \ If \nthings were to straighten themselves, I might be havin the time then."
  119: Alright, can I ask you something else?
  120: Thanx for the info.
  121: "Seen em I have.  Ran like hell, I did.  If yer lookin for 'em, you'll find
    'em over there. \n[MacRae points over to the east]"
  122: "I was thinkin the Deathclaws were the spawn of an unnatural act, but 'em Regulators
    are evil.  \nCome once a month or so and they shows their ugly faces and drag
    a father away from is wee ones."
  123: Anything I could do to help?
  124: Sounds bad, could I ask you another question?
  125: Thanks for the info.
  126: You be wantin to talk to Razor.  A good lass if there ever was one.
  127: "A good group of people is what the Blades are.  Stuck ere between the damn
    Regulators and the \nDeathclaws ain't meant the happiest life for em, but they
    survive."
  128: "[MacRae claps you on the back] Thanks to you, the Blades are going to live
    a better life.  So, \nwhat can an old Scotsman do for ya?"
  129: You had said earlier that if you had some free time, you could teach me a few
    things.
  130: What have you been doing lately?
  131: What do you do around here?
  132: Not a problem.
  133: "Well it's been a wee bit quiet since the Blades helped out Adytum with the
    Regulators.  Me \nteaching services haven't been in such demand."
  134: What do you teach?
  135: Sorry to hear that, hope things get more interesting?
  136: Could you teach me?
  137: Sounds interesting, but I gotta get going.
  138: "Well I guess I do have the time.  Might as well start right now. [MacRae starts
    showing you some \nfighting stances, and ways to take punches like a true Scotsman.]"
  139: You be a quick learner.  Hope that helps you in your travels.
  140: "Well I used to be helpin the Blades out by teachin them a few things about
    protectin themselves \nagainst the DeathClaws and the Regulators.  Now with you
    takin care of all that, things have been a wee \nbit on the boring side lately."
  141: Good seein ya.
GENGHOUL:
  100: What do you want?
  101: Leave me alone.
  102: What?
  103: Don't mess with my stuff.
  104: Hi.
  105: Arrrr!
  106: Grrrrr!
  107: Uungh.
  108: Uhh.
  109: Hey, did you hear that Set was offed?
  110: Set's dead. Set's dead. Set's dead . . .
  111: |-
    There's enough water to go around for everyone.
     Set makes sure of that.
  112: I heard that the mutants got run out of town.
  113: Ever since the mutants left, it's been better.
  114: Hello.
  200: |-
    You examine the pitiful thing, but can not figure out what might
     have made it the way it is.
  201: |-
    It seems to have been human once, or at least descended from
     humans. You guess that the deteriation in the body is most likely due
     to acid or radiation.
  202: |-
    The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, but still
     functioning. While it was once human, it seems to have reverted to a
     more animalistic lifestyle.
  203: |-
    The body of the humanoid looks to be higly irradiated, and much
     of the muscle and brain matter seem to have deteriorated. However, genetic
     indicators lead you to believe that it desceded, like you, from those
     that entered the Vaults.
  300: You have been radiated!
CHDSCOUT:
  100: You see before you an alert scout.
  101: Who goes there?
  102: Me. Me.
  103: Who goes where?
  104: I do!
  105: Deathslayer!
  106: Be at peace. I am a friend.
  107: |-
    Meme? Well, get out of here! This is the property of the Children of
     the Cathedral.
  108: Huh? Me stay!
  109: Huh? You Die!
  110: Me no want to go.
  111: |-
    Great. Of all the people I had to stop, I stopped a piece of cannon
     fodder. What can I do for you?
  112: Go night-night!
  113: Nahnah.
  114: Hep ew.
  115: OK. I suggest you get out of here before you get hurt.
  116: You want to help me? I doubt that. What do you have?
  117: Nahnah.
  118: Dis!
  119: Vaut.
  120: Wasting my time, I see. Get lost!
  121: Vaut. Vaut? What's a vaut?
  122: Numnum.
  123: Nonah.
  124: Valt! Valt!
  125: Oh, you want candy. Sorry, I don't have any. Goodbye.
  126: |-
    Oh, a Vault. I'm sure that is very nice. Maybe you can talk to one
     of my superiors about that. I'm kinda busy right now.
  127: |-
    It is very dangerous here. Big, bad monsters took over this place.
     We are trying to save what we can before they come back.
  128: No go! No go!
  129: Uh, oh.
  130: Bubye.
  131: Okay. Suit yourself. When they get back here, you can be their dinner.
  132: Me kill! Me kill!
  133: Bubye.
  134: You can try. I'm not sure you will get very far, though. Good luck to you.
  135: |-
    Uh oh is right. They are nasty. We are trying to make them understand
     that people and monsters can live together.
  136: Oh. OK. Bubye.
  137: Just tell me who you are before I blow off your head.
  138: I'm a Follower. Where did everyone go?
  139: I'm one of you. Now let me pass.
  140: 'I am '
  141: ". Remember it!"
  142: I don't have to.
  143: DIE!!!
  144: Come with me. I'll show you where everyone else went.
  145: So, you are a Follower?
  146: Of course! Who else would I be?
  147: No, I am a Children member.
  148: |-
    Silly me. I mistook you for someone else. Come with me. I'll show
     you the way.
  149: I don't remember you. What's the name?
  150: 'I''m '
  151: ". How could you forget about me?"
  152: None of your business.
  153: I'm your worst nightmare.
  154: |-
    I'm sorry. I still don't remember you. Maybe someone else may
     remember who you are.
  155: Yes, I remember you. We were told to look for you. Vengeance shall be mine!
  156: You are in my patrol area. It is my business. Talk or die!
  157: 'Fine. I''m '
  158: ". Ring a bell yet?"
  159: Hmmm. I think . . . KILL!
  160: Let me think.
  161: 'Now let me see. It''s '
  162: ". Right?"
  163: Yes, you moron.
  164: Yes.
  165: No stupid. It's Deathstalker!
  166: Good. Just making sure for your headstone.
  167: Then I don't have to let you live. Good night.
  168: And who are you?
  169: I'm a Follower. Where did everyone go?
  170: I'm one of you. Now let me pass.
  171: 'I am '
  172: ". Remember it!"
  173: I don't have to!
  174: DIE!!!
  175: Deathslayer, eh? You look more like worm bait to me.
  176: If you are a friend, then prove it.
  177: I helped kill the Followers.
  178: I helped kill the Rippers.
  179: I helped kill those mutant things.
  180: I helped kill the Children.
  181: |-
    Really? I think my boss would like to hear more about that. Go look
     for Orfeo. He'll be able to reward you for your help.
  182: |-
    For someone who comes in peace, you do an awful lot of killing.
     But those Rippers were causing quite a bit of trouble. Orfeo can reward your
     for your aid.
  183: |-
    You kill harmless creatures which are the end result of man's
     destructive nature and then claim peace?
  184: I'm sorry. They were ugly, so I shot them.
  185: They were hurting people all over the place.
  186: Now I'm going to kill you.
  187: |-
    I still let you live. I think I better take you in to have you
     cleansed of these thoughts of destruction.
  188: |-
    Funny. I thought I saw some of them out in the street trying to clean
     up the gangs.
  189: They attacked the Blades?
  190: What happened to the Adytum?
  191: Die, scum!
  192: Those loser are now no more.
  193: That's a good thing. Well, goodbye.
  194: And now, you won't be either.
  195: That's where I know you from. It's payback time!
  196: |-
    It's you again. I thought you would have learned by now. Too little,
     too late, I guess.
DARREL:
  100: You see Darrel.
  101: You see a Paladin.
  102: Greetings, and welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel.
  103: Duh...
  104: What is the Brotherhood of Steel.
  105: Do you know where I can find a Water Chip?
  106: Do you know anything about the missing caravans?
  107: Nevermind.
  108: |-
    [Laughs at you] Friend, I don't think you have a chance
     of getting in here. The Elders have a minimum IQ requirement
     for new Initiates.
  109: |-
    Yes..a..well..a..No. It's just people don't even try to
     understand what we're all about.
  110: |-
    The Brotherhood is a collective of men and women who have
     dedicated their lives to the preservation of technology.
  111: I've heard that you people sacrifice puppies.
  112: What type of armor is that your wearing.
  113: How do I find out more about your technology.
  114: Good bye.
  115: |-
    No...I never even heard of one of those. One of our head
     scribes may know. Maybe you can ask one of them. That is if you join
     us.
  116: Join? How do I join?
  118: You guys don't know jack.
  119: |-
    Sacrifice puppies!!! Where the hell did you hear that one?
     Don't believe everything you hear in the wastes they're all a bunch
     of pathetic lunatics.
  120: Actually I thought it would have been kinda cool.
  121: Sorry to have upset you.
  122: Everyone is a lunatic outside the Brotherhood of Steel?
  123: |-
    The only way to know anything more about us, is to join us.
     My friend Cabbot can help you with that.
  125: Do you have a Water Chip in the Brotherhood?.
  126: You'll need to speak with Cabbot about that.
  127: What is the Brotherhood of Steel all about anyway?
  128: |-
    That's OK...It's just people don't even try to understand
     what we're all about.
  129: What's there to understand?
  130: Well?... I think you guys just might be a little kookie myself.
  131: |-
    Technology. That is all that any one needs to understand.
     Join us and you will come to know this.
  132: How does one join the Brotherhood?
  133: You people are a little too left field for me.
  134: I'm sorry you feel that way.
  135: |-
    This is Powered Combat Infantry Armor model T-51b or more
     commonly know as Power Armor.
  136: |-
    I've been wanderin' the wastes for weeks for weeks now and
     I've never seen armor like this before.
  137: It looks like it would be cumbersome to wear.
  139: |-
    The Brotherhood are the sole bearers of the Power Armor in
     the wastes. Only the honored, and Knights of the highest Stature
     are given the privilege to wear the ultimate armor.
  140: That still doesn't answer why I've never seen it before.
  141: I would like to join.
  143: |-
    Heathens have tried and failed to take our Power Armor from
     us. They would have to kill a Brother to possess his birthright,
     and if it comes to that, the armor would be in such poor condition
     as to render it useless.
  144: I think I'll try to take it off your dead cold body.
  145: Bye.
  146: Do I have to sacrifice a puppie to join?
  147: |-
    Cumbersome? Not in the least. The sacred armor is so finely
     constructed to such exacting specifications that it feels like an
     extension of the blessed one's own body. It increases one's strength
     many times over and helps you resist the effects of radiation so
     that you may more effectively serve the brotherhood. I would feel
     diminished without my holy armor.
  148: How come no one else in the wastes has this armor.
  149: I want one of those. Sign me up.
  151: You need to speak with Cabbot if you wish to join.
  152: I can't believe it. They're sending him down there?
  153: I can't believe it. They're sending her down there?
  154: So you took the Famous Glow Quest. (Laughs)
  155: No... I'm going to the Ancient Order.
  156: The Glow, what's that?
  157: It's none of your business what I am doing.
  158: Yeah, I did. Bye.
  159: |-
    Glow, Ancient Order it's the same thing. It's still not a
     good place to visit.
  160: Why do you say that?
  161: |-
    How hard could it be. All I have to do is go get something
     and bring it back. It's the old send the new guy on a quest thing.
  162: Why the two names?
  163: What's so special about this place.
  164: |-
    The Glow, as it is known to topsiders, was supposedly a
     place where some of the most advanced weapons of that time were
     developed. At least that's what it says in the ancient writings.
     Now as fasr as any of us can tell it's a big crater filled with
     Rads. I think the Elders send Brotherhood wanabes down there
     just to get rid of them.
  165: Others? There was others before me.
  166: I'm going to the Ancient Order. Where's that located.
  167: Your right. It's not any of my business.
  168: |-
    Well? To start it's a good 18 days travel to the Southeast
     from here. And then there's the radiation. There's a reason none
     of us have ever gone to the "Ancient Order". If you don't have
     Rad-X you'll be cooked before you even know what hit you.
  170: Let me get this straight...
  171: |-
    Most topsiders think that it is just a big Radioactive hole.
     Thus the name became the Glow or some even call it the Hot Spot.
     We in the Brotherhood know the truth. According to the ancient
     writings this place was the source of all our technology. And
     who knows what may still be there.
  173: Let me get this straight...
  174: Others have tried. We never heard from them again.
  175: |-
    Hell, you've almost talked me out of even wanting to join
     the Brotherhood.
  176: They were weak. I'll be seen' you around.
  177: What should I watch for when I go down there.
  179: The Glow and the Ancient Order are one in the same.
  180: What is the Glow?
  181: |-
    Don't get me wrong the Brotherhood is a great place to join.
     It's by far the safest place to live in the wastes. No place else
     will you find better weapons and armor. We serve technology and
     technology serves us.
  182: Sounds good, I'll be going on my way.
  183: What can you tell me about the Glow.
  184: It doesn't sound like it is worth the trouble.
  185: What?...
  186: Why does the Ancient Order have two names?
  187: Where is the Ancient Order, and the dangers are...?
  188: Can I ask you a few questions?
  189: |-
    Most topsiders think that it is just a big Radioactive hole.
     Thus the name became the Glow or some even call it the Hot Spot.
     We in the Brotherhood know the truth. According to the ancient
     writings this place was the source of all our technology. And who
     knows what may still be there.
  190: Got another question for you.
  191: Can I help you?
  192: Nevermind. Bye.
  193: Sure ask away.
  194: Hello
  195: |-
    Yes, Rutger came here personally not too long ago, and that's
     not like him. He was trying to find out what had been happening to
     his caravans. I've no idea what it could have been. A few others
     say they saw something over near the hub, but it disappeared before
     they could get close enough. It's all very unnerving, I hope it's
     resolved soon.
  196: |-
    I heard you make animal sacrifices! Maybe you take these
     caravans for your dark rituals!
  197: Any suspicions?
  198: |-
    Well, if you see anything let me know. I'd like to get to the
     bottom of this soon myself.
  199: |-
    Not really, but I suspect it's foul play... but then again,
     there are a lot of strange and dangerous creatures out there in the
     wastelands. It could simply be some creature, or more likely a
     herd or band of them. I hope that helps. Good day.
  201: Thanks for your time. Bye.
  202: OK, Thanks. Bye.
  203: Thanks for the info. Bye.
  204: Thanks, Bye.
  205: Ok... Thanks for the info.
  206: I Thank you for the warning. Bye.
  207: Thank you. Bye.
  208: Thank you for your time.
  209: |-
    If you were lookin' to get a hold of some better arms,
     maybe you should try the Glow down south. [Darrel points south]
  210: Here take some Rad-X. [Darrel gives you some pills]
  211: |-
    Swallow these like this. [Darrel motions taking the
     pills and rubs his tummy]. Mmmmm yummm.
  212: |-
    Wait, wait, Not yet! [Darrel stops you from taking the pills]
     Wait until you get to the Glow.
  300: "[more]"
MILES:
  100: You see Miles, the chemist of Adytum.
  101: You see a thin man in a white smock.
  102: I don't believe we've met. I'm Miles. What can I do for you?
  103: I'm just looking around, thanks.
  104: That smock makes you look like a scientist. What are you studying?
  105: Huh?
  106: Well, enjoy your stay in our little town.
  107: |-
    I'm a chemist. Mostly, I make primer and powder so that we can re-use
     the brass casings from bullets. But I also dabble with some other chemicals.
  108: So you make bullets for Adytum.
  109: Where do you get the sulfur, potassium nitrate, and other chemicals?
  110: What other chemicals do you work with?
  111: Thanks for the information.
  112: |-
    Yes, although Smitty is the one who actually casts the bullets.
     I just refill the brass casings.
  113: But the Hub merchants make a profit off of you and the town.
  114: |-
    It's unusual to find someone who can appreciate chemistry!
     But to answer your question, some of the materials we get from Hub merchants;
     others I manufacture or just find in the area. For instance, the dung heaps
     from the Brahmin are a good source, as well as some of the strains of fungus
     that I cultivate.
  115: |-
    Well, I've been trying to get some strong acids so that Smitty can use
     them for etching. I also have been trying to make some permanent dyes and inks.
     But without access to natural inks, it's difficult.
  116: Any time.
  117: Oh dear. I'm afraid I can't help you.
  118: Hello again. Can I help you?
  119: |-
    Yes, well, we have to make a living. Since the hydroponic farms aren't
     functioning, we have to buy food from the merchants, and bullets are the only
     thing we have to sell.
  120: I could try to get the parts to fix the hydroponic farms.
  121: Oh. Well, that's too bad.
  122: |-
    Really? That would be wonderful! We're just missing a few parts, but
     I'm sure that  if you could scrounge up the right pieces, we could be
     self-sufficient! Sammael might be able to give you some help.
  123: Have you found the parts yet?
  124: Yes, here they are.
  125: Not yet, who did you say I should ask about them?
  126: |-
    You'll need to talk to Sammael. You'll usually find him in
     a tent down by the farms during the day.
  127: |-
    [Miles looks over the parts] Those are them, but it looks like
     Smitty is going to have to do a little work on them.
     Can you take them over to him?
  128: I've got other things to deal with.  Can you do it yourself?
  129: Sure, I'll be back after he's fixed them.
  130: Sure, I appreciate you finding them for us.
  131: And . . .
  132: Not a problem.
  133: |-
    Oh. I almost forgot. Here is some stuff, for your trouble.
     [Miles hands you some caps and some stimpacks.]
  134: Were you able to take the parts over to Smitty?
  135: |-
    [Miles takes the fixed parts from you] Looks like Smitty did a great job on
     these. Thanks for the help, and here's some stuff for your trouble.
  136: "[Miles hands you some caps and some stimpacks.]"
  137: |-
    If you ever get back this way, you might want to look me and Smitty up.
     We might be able to help you out with some adjustments to some of your equipment.
     Smitty can work wonders with certain weapons, and I can help out with
     certain sorts of armor.
  138: |-
    Looks like you found some Power Armor. I've heard of a chemical process
     that I could use to harden the surface of the armor. However, I'm missing some
     information which could give me the last few clues to the formula and
     reagents necessary.  I've heard the Librarian in the Hub, Mrs. Stapleton,
     has some journals and books that might be of use.
     If you could get those from there, I could probably test the process
     on your armor.
  139: Sounds good. I'll go talk to Mrs. Stapleton.
  140: I got better things to do then fetch something else for you.
  141: |-
    Well, if you ever change your mind, just go see Mrs. Stapleton
     and then head on back here.
  142: Had a chance to get to the Hub yet and visit Mrs. Stapleton?
  143: Yeah, here are the books.
  144: Not yet.
  145: |-
    [Miles takes the books from you, and starts flipping through them.] Hmmmm.
     Yes, hmmmm. [He mumbles to himself for a few more minutes.]
     Well, I think I can figure it out, but it will take a full day
     for the bonding to occur. Is that acceptable?
  146: Not a problem.
  147: Sorry, don't have the time.
  148: |-
    Well, when you have the time, come back and I'll do the process
     on your armor.
  149: "[Miles takes your armor from you.]"
  150: |-
    [Miles hands your armor back to you, it seems to glint a
     little more than it did before.] Well, I think it worked! Hope it helps you out.
  151: |-
    What happened to your power armor? I can only help you out
     if you have power armor.
  152: Nice to see you, but I'm right in the middle of some research.
  153: Nothing I can do with that type of armor. Sorry.
PETER:
  100: You see Peter, leader of the Follower Scouts.
  101: What are you doing around here? Can't you see we are busy?
  102: Huh?
  103: I am sorry. I will go now.
  104: Can I help you with anything?
  105: Who can I talk to about giving my assistance.
  106: |-
    Great. I'm busy, and I get a moron tailing me. Go look for Jake
     if you need someone to talk to.
  107: Sure. You can start by getting out of my way.
  108: Certainly. Anything else?
  109: There must be something more I can do.
  110: Do not throw me to the side.
  111: Yes. You can get out of here.
  112: |-
    Fine. It doesn't look like I will get rid of you any other way.
     It seems that we are having a security problem. You want to help, you
     find the problem.
  113: Okay. Will do.
  114: Forget it!
  115: Fine. Get out then!
  116: Look, we have a breach in security. We need to find this breach and end it.
  117: Ok. Will do.
  118: Forget it!
  119: Do I look like a guide. Go talk to Jake if you are looking for a guide.
  120: Leave. i am trying to finish up a little work.
  121: We need that spy gone. Hurry up!
  122: |-
    Good job on taking out Heather. I should have known it was her.
     She always seemed to disappear in the raids. Here, take this and go.
FLASH:
  100: |-
    Watch yourself around the Doc, and I won't have
     to get medieval on your face.
  101: We're closed. Come back later.
  102: I gotta see the Doc.
  103: OK, will do.
  104: It is very important that I see the doctor.
  105: Hnnn.
  106: Nice weather we're having, huh?
  107: |-
    That's just too bad. Get out of here, and don't come
     back until morning. This office isn't open at night.
  108: Hold on a second, I gotta check with the Doc.
  109: What do you want now?
  110: I gotta see the Doc.
  111: Is the doctor available?
  112: Hnnn!
  113: No way. The Doc is sleeping. Come back later.
  114: I dunno, why don't you talk to him yourself.
  115: Yeah, OK. Get out.
  116: Hey, this is private property. You'd better be leaving, now.
  117: Eat my dung.
  118: |-
    If you don't get out of my way, you'll be needing the
     doctor for personal reasons.
  119: Don't you know that women are the weaker sex?
  120: Think I'm weak? Watch this then . . .
  121: I'll just be leaving.
  122: |-
    Take your puny threats and run home to mamma. You're talking
     to a real man here.
  123: Think I'm weak? Watch this then . . .
  124: I'll just be leaving.
  125: Whoa! If you really want to see him, go right ahead.
  126: Well, when is the doctor here?
  127: The doc sees patients from 8 to 5. Now get outta here.
  128: When is the doctor here?
SECDOOR:
  100: The security door is locked.
  101: The security door is not locked.
  102: You manage to unlock the security door.
  103: You fail to unlock the security door.
  104: |-
    You manage to trigger the passive alert on the door, clamping down the
     electronic lock. Good job, chromo.
  105: You gain 25 experience points for picking the lock.
PAUL:
  100: You see Knight Paul.
  101: Ahhh, so you’re the new initiate.  Welcome aboard.  What can I do for you?
  102: Who are you and what do you do here?
  103: Where can I get some weapons?
  104: Vree told me I could see a new weapon.
  105: Do you have a water chip?
  106: Do you have any Power Armor parts?
  107: Whaadda?
  108: Nothing, thanks.
  109: I’m Paul, head of Energy Weapons Development.
  110: What kind of Energy Weapons?
  111: Do you have the Laser Pistol that Vree designed?
  112: Laser, Plasma... you name it, I’ve built it.. or at least re-built it.
  113: Any chance I can get one?
  114: That’s great.  Keep up the good work. Bye.
  115: |-
    You would have to see Michael to be issued a weapon. He can’t authorize you for one though, for that
     you would have to see Talus.
  116: Alright, where can I find them?
  117: Ok. Thanks for the info, bye.
  118: |-
    They are both on the first floor of the base.  Talus is usually in the training
     room and Michael does his duty just outside of the storage room.
  119: Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?
  120: Thanks.  I’ll be going now.
  121: Sure.  What can I help you with?
  122: Where can I get some new weapons?
  123: Do you have a water chip?
  124: Do you have any parts for Power Armor?
  125: Can I see the new laser pistol?
  126: Actually, I need to get going. Bye.
  127: |-
    Yes. The latest in hand held laser technology. [He
     takes a small pistol from a work table and hands it to you]
  128: 'This is nice, can I keep this? '
  129: What kind of damage will this do to a person?
  130: |-
    That one won’t do you much good.  It’s still lacking the lenses and amplifier.
     [He takes the pistol back from you and puts it on the work table]
     If you really want one, go talk to Talus or Michael.
  131: Thanks, where can I find them?
  132: Thanks, I should be going now.
  133: Can I ask you some more questions?
  134: A Water Chip?  The ones from the old Vault-Tec shelters?
  135: Yes!.. Do you have one?
  136: |-
    No. Those things were junk, they were prone to failure.  We don’t deal with
     purifying our own water here.  We have water delivered by caravans from the Hub.
  137: Ok.  Thanks.  Well I’ve got to keep looking for one. Bye.
  138: Could I ask you some more questions?
  139: |-
    In the hands of a skilled warrior, it could cut a person in half.
     The beam will shear flesh faster then you can run your finger through sand.
  140: Can I keep this one?
  141: No.  I only work on Energy weapons.  You should go see Kyle if you have questions
    about Power Armor.
  142: Actually Kyle doesn’t have the parts, that why I’m looking for them.
  143: Thanks. Bye.
  144: Well, I can’t help you with that.  Sorry.
  145: Thanks.  I need to get going. Bye.
  146: Can I ask you some more questions?
  147: 'Hello again, Initiate '
  148: ".  What can I help you with?"
  149: Who are you and what do you do here?
  150: Where can I get some weapons?
  151: Vree told me I could see a new weapon.
  152: Do you have a water chip?
  153: Do you have any Power Armor parts?
  154: Whaadda?
  155: Nothing, thanks.
  156: Um.. please leave before you drool on something important.
HTWRGRD:
  100: You see one of Hightower's guards.
  101: You better leave. Daren Hightower doesn't take visitors.
  102: Your company is not desired.
  103: Leave!
  104: You're not allowed here.
  105: Go away, or you'll regret it.
  106: This house is off limits to the likes of you.
  107: What the…  Get em!
  108: You made a big mistake coming in here!
  109: What are you doing here?  You're dead meat.
  110: Mmmm, looks good.
  111: Is that Brahmin I smell?
  112: Hook it to my veins!
  113: Anything in the fridge?
  114: How much longer?
  115: I'm hungry.
  116: Is it almost ready?
  117: I'm going to pass out!
WOMEN:
  100: You see a bruised and battered woman.
  101: No please don't!
  102: "[sobs uncontrollably]"
  103: "[whispers]Please help me!"
  104: Thank you for saving me.
ODDWALL:
  100: There is something odd about one of the east walls.
GENPALB:
  100: Die, you dog!
  101: My defeat shall be avenged!
  102: Hold, initiate! What do you have to report?
  103: All quiet on the western front.
  104: Rad Scorpions and intolerable heat. Uh . . . sir.
  105: Actually, I wanted to know if you had heard anything.
  106: Nothing to report, sir!
  107: Ruh?
  108: |-
    Hold! I recognize you -- you've visited the Brotherhood. Some may trust you,
     but I do not. State your business!
  109: My business is my own, just as yours belongs to you.
  110: I wanted to see a friendly face.
  111: Wandering the wastes, trying to survive.
  112: I'm killing desert vermin. Do you disapprove?
  113: I will only state it to the head of your order. Take me to the Brotherhood.
  114: Biz?
  115: |-
    Hold! I recognize you and I do not trust you. I give you fair warning:
     if you make trouble for us, you will be shot dead. Now move!
  116: Hold! Who goes there! State your name and your business!
  117: 'I am '
  118: " and I seek a water chip for my Vault. Can you help me?"
  119: " and I'm trying to find the source of mutant attacks."
  120: " and that's none of your business!"
  121: " and I'm looking for adventure."
  122: Up yours, soldier boy.
  123: Runk!
  124: |-
    Halt! These lands belong to the Brotherhood of Steel. Leave now, or we
     will shoot you as a trespasser.
  125: Very good. Carry on, Initiate.
  126: I see. Carry on, Initiate.
  127: |-
    There are reports of large mutant humans attacking travelers, so we're
     increasing our vigilance. Keep a close eye on the area and retreat to the
     compound if necessary. Initiate, dismissed!
  128: |-
    These are troubled times, Initiate! Mutants are on the march, attacking
     caravans! We need information, and we need it now! Nothing to report is not
     good enough!
  129: |-
    Get your sorry ass out of here, and bring us back some useful intelligence!
     Initiate, dismissed!
  130: |-
    Oh yes, I heard about you. Not much of an IQ, but a helluva fighter.
     Too bad.
  131: |-
    This is our land, and here, your business is our business. I repeat,
     state your business.
  132: I seek a water chip for my Vault. Can you help me?
  133: I am trying to find the source of mutant attacks.
  134: This may be your land, but I am not your slave.
  135: |-
    I've been wandering the wastes for a long time. I wanted to know if
     you have news.
  136: A friendly face? It won't be mine. I would recommend leaving.
  137: |-
    As are we all. As long as you do not act against the Brotherhood, you
     will not be harmed, but tread carefully.
  138: |-
    It depends on whether or not you consider us vermin. If you attack our
     enemies, you will be permitted to travel in our territory. If you offend us,
     you will die. Consider yourself warned.
  139: That's a reasonable request. Fall in.
  140: |-
    Water chip? I hope you're not serious! You'd be better off struggling
     on the surface than enslaving yourself to a single piece of machinery.
  141: |-
    As are we. The most common theory is that they come from the Glow, but
     I doubt even mutants could survive there for long. If you find out
     something, let us know.
  142: |-
    How dare you accuse me of such a thing! The Brotherhood of Steel has
     never forced anyuone to serve us against their will. That goes against everything
     we believe in. Get out of my sight!
  143: |-
    We found a wrecked caravan about a day's journey to the west. We found
     one survivor - poor girl. She claimed they were attacked by mutant humans
     with incredible strength.
  144: |-
    We've heard enough reports that we're . . . concerned. I would walk
     cautiously, if I were you.
  145: |-
    I'm going to have to teach you some manners, boy. This should make
     for some light entertainment.
  146: |-
    I'm going to have to teach you some manners, girl. This should make
     for some light entertainment.
  147: Your mind is completely gone. Poor creature.
  148: Stop wasting my time, fool!
  149: What do you want?
  150: Nothing.
  151: Then I suggest you leave.
CODEDISK:
  100: This is the disk of the Brotherhood's Code of Conduct.
  101: 'Pip Boy displays: File Found on System. Aborting download.'
  102: 'Pip Boy displays: Downloading data from Disk.'
  103: You see a encryption decoder disk.
  104: You see a holodisk.
VALTCORE:
  100: |-
    This is the Central Core. This is the heart of
     the computer system.
SSRADSCO:
  100: You gain 500 experience points for stopping the Radscorpions.
MICHELLE:
  100: You see Michelle.
  101: "[]"
  102: "[]"
  103: You see a member of the Blades.
  104: You see a member of the Blades.
  105: You think that might be Books.
  106: You think that might be Scars.
  107: You think that might be Gunner.
  108: You think that might be Twitch.
  109: You think that might be Hammer.
  110: You think that might be Razor.
  111: What are you doing here?
  112: Hhrrrnnn.
  113: Nothing. Honest.
  114: I'm just looking around.
  115: This! *smack*
  116: |-
    A moron. I think that you'd best get out of here. Otherwise,
     you may become target practice.
  117: Arroo!
  118: Arook.
  119: |-
    Nothing, eh? I think you're hiding something. Out with it
     before you see your guts.
  120: I'm really a Martian.
  121: I'm here to stop the gang wars.
  122: I'm not up to anything.
  123: I'm up to THIS! *smack*
  124: |-
    Everyone knows there are no such things as Martians.
     All real aliens are from Venus. Now, you die!
  125: Sure, and I'm the Queen of Mexico.
  126: Honest. I want to stop the wars so I can help Adytum.
  127: Your Majesty, I truly seek to end the wars.
  128: |-
    If your intelligence were greater, I would try to
     explain the benefits of peace.
  129: |-
    If you're here to do that, then you'll need to try and find
     Razor. She'll let you know what we think of that.
  130: Uh, thanks. I think.
  131: Okay. Good bye.
  132: |-
    Mock me, will you? I guess I should expect as much from a
     child. Oh, by the way. Here!
  133: |-
    Fancy talk will only get you so far. Here, it will get
     you about six feet under.
  134: |-
    If you are up to nothing, then we will put you up to
     something. I think 'target' makes a good something.
  135: |-
    You looked. Now, what do you want? Think quick. It may mean
     the difference between walking out of here and becoming
     a permanent resident.
  136: I'd like to live here.
  137: I'm really a Ripper in disguise.
  138: I want to bring peace to the gangs.
  139: Leaving.
  140: |-
    Nothing special. Just looking at the garbage to be
     recycled.
  141: |-
    We never said anything about living. You would just
     reside here. Indefinitely. Enjoy your stay.
  142: 'I''m glad you said that. I''ve been meaning to sharpen this. '
  143: Soon I will have a hide to sharpen it on.
  144: |-
    Not so fast. The only way someone leaves here is if they
     are a Blade, or in a bag.
  145: Then I want to be a Blade.
  146: How big is this bag?
  147: You forget the third option. Me!
  148: |-
    Fat chance. But, he's a test. If you can find Razor, then
     you can talk to her about that.
  149: Big enough to stuff your body parts in when we finish.
  150: |-
    I am not Sleeping Beauty. I do not need to be awakened.
     Get out or die.
  151: |-
    Hear you're out for the bastard's head. Give him an extra
     knife twist for me.
  152: Welcome back. The Hole is open and ready to house you once more.
RUBCORE:
  100: |-
    The rest of the vault in this direction had delicate equipment
     that has probably been ruined and destroyed. There is a very
     low chance of anything remaining of value.
CATHSHOP:
  100: You see a shopkeeper.
  101: |-
    The Holy Flame does not appreciate thieves and scoundrels in his
     house of worship.  You will be punished!
  102: Hng!
  103: I wasn't stealing from you, honest!
  104: Why don't you tell the Holy Flame when you see him after your 'punishment.'
  105: I care not for your lies, neither shall the Master.
  106: I'm sorry the shop is closed.
  107: Nugga.
  108: Thanks for nothing.
  109: Why is that?
  110: Don't mention it.
  111: |-
    The Children do not have to deal with your kind.  And you've been
     causing us a serious problem. I would like you to go away before I
     have to call in reinforcements.
  112: You don't have to do that. I'm your friend.
  113: Whatever.
  114: |-
    I refuse to deal with those that use weapons to make demands.  We
     Children have grown beyond the simple use of guns and weapons.
  115: Gun control fascist nut!
  116: Let me holster it and we can barter in peace.
  117: Good, I'd like that. I'd be happy to do business with you.
  118: Greetings, my fellow Child.  How can I help you?
  119: Lugga!?
  120: What do you have to trade?
  121: Thanks. See you later, alligator.
  122: I'm sorry. Perhaps we can just make a deal.
  123: Brye!
  124: After a while, crocodile. I can't believe I just said that.
  125: |-
    Greetings! How can I help you? I do hope that you will take a moment
     to realize the significance of any future decisions you might make in
     regards to your soul...
  126: Baarta!
  127: What do you have to trade?
  128: Where can I get one of those fancy robes of yours...
  129: Only trusted members of the Cathedral are allowed to wear the holy purple.
  130: I guess that answers my question, thanks!
  131: Stuck up fool. I guess I will have to take yours!
  132: Oh, well. What do you have to trade?

    Oh, stuff to pander to the rubes who walk in the door.  Nothing too special.
     Go ahead, take a look.
  134: Thanks, see you later.
  135: |-
    We have all sorts of special items to remember your trip to the Cathedral.
     These memories can't be bought cheaply, you understand.
  136: Thanks...
  137: You're welcome. Have pleasant days for the rest of your life.
SKUMDOOR:
  100: The door to the Skum Pitt is locked.
  101: You manage to unlock the door.
  102: You fiddle with the door, but fail to unlock it.
  103: You hear something snap. Looks like the lock is jammed.
  104: The door isn't locked.
SARAH:
  100: Oh, my god! You killed him!
  101: Hng!
  102: Tough luck.
  103: He was my enemy. I had to kill him.
  104: I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was so close to you.
  105: You didn't have to kill him! [Sarah sobs.] Leave me alone.
  106: |-
    He was my lover. He was my best friend. I can't believe that you
     did that to him.
  107: |-
    Again, I apologize. How could I tell that he meant so much to you?
     Look at him. He's a mutant.
  108: I'm going to kill all of his kind.
  109: |-
    He was a human being. The only way he could survive was by being dipped.
     You killed him.
  110: Sorry.
  111: Oh, well. At least it's one guy for my kill counter.
  112: Asshole.
  113: What are you doing out of your protective cell?
  114: Zug-zug!
  115: Walking around.
  116: I'm not a prisoner here.
  117: No thanks, I already have a boyfriend.
  118: |-
    You should be in your cell. The guards are keeping us here for our
     protection. The robots have been programmed to attack unescorted normals.
     Once I've been dipped, I'll be able to spend time helping the Unity.
  119: Yeah, okay. Whatever. Have fun.
  120: You want to do that?
  121: Of course, it's the best chance humanity has to survive.
  122: |-
    Wow! I think you could get into a lot of trouble. Please don't
     hang out near me.
  123: Can you excuse us, we're talking here!
REGULATR:
  100: You see a Regulator, one of the guards of Adytum.
  101: "[]"
  102: Keep your weapons under control while you're here.
  103: Welcome to Adytum, stranger. Watch yourself, we'll be watching you.
  104: I'd like to enter.
  105: Can I ask you a few questions?
  106: Uhhh . . .
  107: |-
    Zimmerman might have a use for you. Come inside, but
     remember, we're watching.
  108: Welcome back! You're welcome here any time.
  109: |-
    Don't you have a job to do? Come back here when you've
     dealt with the it.
  110: Go away!
  111: What do you want now?
  112: I'd like to enter.
  113: "[]"
  114: Nothing. Never mind.
  115: "[]"
  116: No.
  117: What do you want to know about?
  118: What do you do here?
  119: Can you tell me more about the Boneyard?
  120: How can I get inside?
  121: |-
    What do you know about the Children of the Cathedral
     and the Followers of the Apocalypse?
  122: Nothing, thanks.
  123: |-
    I'm one of the Regulators. It's our job to keep the peace
     in Adytum, and to protect the town. Our boss, Caleb,
     could tell you more.
  124: |-
    East of us are the Followers. They are a bunch of peace-nuts.
     East are the Blade, a bunch of Skags if you ask me. A ways south of here is the Cathedral,
    where the Children have their religious center.
  125: |-
    Sorry, but we have to be careful of strangers here. Too
     dangerous. Maybe you can do some work for Zimmerman.
  126: Finish your job.
  127: You're welcome here anytime, of course!
  128: |-
    They're both groups of nuts. The Followers want everyone to be
     peaceful and happy. They don't realize that the world is too
     harsh for that.
  129: |-
    The Children have some sort of god they worship
     in their Cathedral to the south. They have a hospital,
     but they're a little too weird to be on the level.
  130: You were warned to keep your weapons under control!
  131: You'd better put your weapons away while you're here.
  132: A thief, eh? Let me show you what we do to your kind here!
  133: "[Done]"
  134: Watch yourself.
  135: We're watching you.
  136: Stay in line.
  137: What 'da looking at.
  138: What 'da want.
  139: I guess this means we're done with you, old man.

  1104: They're on the north of here.
  1105: They're to the east of the Blades, and then north of the Deathclaws.
  1106: We trade with them.
  1107: Isn't that a city north of here?
  1108: A what?
  1109: Tine's store is underground near the gate.
  1110: He's the mayor.
  1111: I hear it's out east.
  1112: That's a myth.
  1113: We protect Adytum.
  1114: They go outside to get things.
  1115: This is the Boneyard.
CREDDOOR:
  100: The door is locked. You have never seen a lock quite like this.
  101: The door is closed, but it is unlocked.
  102: You try to open the door, but fail. You suddenly realized the door is locked.
  103: You fail to pick the lock on the door.
  104: You pick the lock on the door.
DIRTNAP:
  100: You see a glowing ghoul.
  101: |-
    A dirt nap will be given if alterations are made. Last
     one here tried.
  102: The flow ends. So does your life.
HARRY:
  100: You see Harry, the Super Mutant.
  101: Hey! You not look like ghoul. How come?
  102: That's because I dressed up really snazzy today.
  103: But I am a ghoul!
  104: Let me guess . . . because I'm not a ghoul?
  105: Uh?
  106: Huh?
  107: Huh?
  108: Whuh?
  109: Mom?
  110: Oooo...That was snazzy like, huh?
  111: Nah, I was just fooling you, I'm not a ghoul
  112: What do you do here?
  113: You not ghoul! I knew, I knew! Not fool Harry!
  114: Yeahhh, that's pretty obvious.
  115: You're right. And now that you know, I'll have to kill you.
  116: You not ghoul. Orders say not-ghoul, not be here.
  117: Who's giving you orders?
  118: Ok, thanks. I'll be leaving now.
  119: |-
    Lou tell me watch place. Not let no one in. Not
     normals most. Take normals to the Lou. Hey...
  120: But I'm not a normal!
  121: OK, let's go see Lou.

  123: Oh ho-ho, you find out soooon.

  127: I'm a new race of super mutant.
  128: I'm a highly advanced robot.
  129: Alright, I am a normal.
  130: No! Harry know you not. Not like you!
  131: Oh, ok. Harry think what to do.
  132: Not like you. Hurt you now. Bad.
  133: Uh, hello, pretty lady. You look real nice.
  134: Are you busy? I could use a big, strong man.
  135: Move a little closer. I've got something for you.
  136: Harry gotta guard this place. Gotta stay right here.
  137: Ahh, I understand. You have a good day, then.
  138: That makes me sad.
  139: Hey, you a normal! Gotta take you to Lou. Now!
  140: Please, don't do it. Let me go.
  141: Ah, heck with it! Watch these feminine wiles, mutie! . . .
  142: Ohhh...Go away quick or Harry be in trouble.
  143: |-
    OK. Go now. Gotta keep eyes out for humans. Not have
     time for you.

  147: You hurt Harry's friends! I...hurt...you!
  148: Ohhh...You again?  What want now?
  149: I want you to take me to your superiors.
  150: Nothing, just passing through.

  152: Um..OK. Move along then.
  153: Hey, you a normal! You come with Harry!
  154: Hmm...OK. Take ya to Lou.
  155: Ummm...yes. You prime normal.  The Lou will be happy.  Take away, take away.
  156: Wait, wait! You don't understand.
  157: I'll kill you with my bare hands.
  158: Not have to. Harry follow orders. Take to the Lou.
  159: Harry not think so, but you can try. Let go, guys.
  160: Hey, Harry hear about you. You break the Vats!
  161: Yep, I did. And now I'm going to take you out.
  162: Yes, I'm the one. What are you going to do about it?
  163: Uh-huh.
  164: Uhh, me let you go. OK? You not show face here again? Please?
  165: Not good enough.
  166: Goodbye. I don't expect to see you again.

  170: You kill Gary!
  171: You kill my brother, Barry!

  173: You kill Sally! He did have lousy name. But not reason to kill him!
  174: Not bother me. Leave alone!
  175: Uhhh...Not know.
  176: I dunno, but think he like a boss people.
  177: He Lou Tenant. He my boss. Not tell him, but Harry could take on good day.
  178: Set a wuss. He think he run place, but we run.
  179: The what?
  180: Hmph! Punies.
  181: Weak. Not know why the Lou want normals. They suck!
  182: Here, dummy. [Sigh] You stupid?

KANE:
  100: You see Kane.
  101: What's the job and what's it pay?
  102: Work for this dump?  You've got to be joking.
  103: Damn straight, and it looks like I'm going to have to kick your ass, just because.
  104: Sorry, maybe later.
  105: No thanks.
  106: Tuk?
  107: I guess the reports must have been wrong, beat it.  We don't hire skags.
  108: |-
    It's not skag work. You'll need to do 'it' quick and clean.  The boss'll give you details, but it's
     more money than you'll make in a month working for the caravans, but only if you're good enough. We don't
     take kindly to failures, if you know what I mean.
  109: Sounds good.
  110: I can't right now.  Let me get back to you.
  111: Who do I have to kill?
  112: No thanks.  I don't need the money.
  113: |-
    I'm sure you're familiar with our sort of business, so let me just say it would be in your best
     interest to keep this to yourself.  Shall we?
  114: I hope for your sake that that was an attempt at humor.  Do not cross us, you
    will regret it.
  115: Sure.  Now what does this 'work' involve?
  116: Yeah, whatever, tough guy.
  117: |-
    I don't think you understood me. Let me clarify.  If you don't watch your manners, you will find yourself
     dead, tough guy.
  118: |-
    I don't think you understood me. Let me clarify. If you don't watch your manners, you will find yourself
     dead, tough gal.
  119: No, let me clarify--if you don't watch it, I'll be wearing your ass for a shoe.
  120: Okay.  I get the picture.  Now what is it you want me to do?
  121: I'll talk to you later. I've got to go.
  123: Oh, please do.  We'll be holding our breath.
  124: But of course, good day.
  125: |-
    Don't need the money?  Surely you're jesting, but from what I've heard about you, you might enjoy the
     work I had in mind for you.
  126: Really?  I might be interested, lead on.
  127: No thanks.
  128: I'll get back to you.
  129: It's... Would you like to accompany me down stairs?  There are too many ears
    around.
  130: Sure.
  131: Not interested.
  132: Not right now, I'll get back to you.

  135: You've had your chance, now beat it.
  136: Are you looking for trouble?
  137: You just don't learn do you?  You'll soon learn some respect.
  138: |-
    I've heard of you.  They say you're one mean son of a bitch.  If you're
     looking for some work, I might be able to set you up with someone.  Are you interested?

    I've heard of you.  They say you're one mean bitch.  If you're

    I've heard of you.  You're the one that took out Killian in Junktown, nice going.  Gizmo must have
     paid you well for that one. What brings you to the Hub, looking for some work?
  141: |-
    I've heard of you.  You're the one that took out Gizmo over in Junktown.  Killian must have paid you
     a good sum for that job.  Are you here for some work, maybe?
  142: |-
    I've heard of you.  You're the bitch that took out Killian and Gizmo.  Now that's the way to
     solve a problem... So, what brings you to the Maltese Falcon?  Looking for some work?
  143: |-
    I've heard of you.  You're the bastard that took out Killian and Gizmo.  Now that's the way to
     solve a problem... So, what brings you to the Maltese Falcon?  Looking for some work?
  144: I've heard of you.  You're making quite a name for yourself. What brings you
    to the Hub?
  145: I'm looking for a water chip.
  146: I need to talk to Decker.
  147: 'Do you run this joint? '
  148: I'm here to kick your ass.
  149: I think I'm going to have to hurt you now.
  150: You won't have to worry about your health when I get through with you.
  151: I'm cleansing the world of all that is evil!
  152: I've got to go, bye.
  153: That's it, bye.
  154: Tuk?
  155: Barooka!
  156: A water chip?  Never heard of it, we only sell drinks.  Go see Bob's Iguana
    Bits, if you're hungry.
  157: |-
    It's an electronic device that regulates the filtering system of a water purifier and monitors the
     output for any contamination.  Mine's broken and I'm looking for a replacement.
  158: No, it's a small piece of machinery that runs a water purifier.
  159: 'Another question for you... '
  160: Okay thanks. Bye.
  161: Do I look like a merchant? Stop wasting my time.
  162: |-
    You might want to check with the Water Merchants.  They're south of the Merchant Market.  You can't
     miss them.  They surround a big water tower.
  163: You?  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
  164: Things will look really funny to you when I get through rearranging your face!
  165: We'll see who's laughing when the blood settles.
  166: You think you can take me? You may be a strong one, but that won't help you
    dodge a bullet.
  167: You're right, I'm so sorry.  Please don't shoot me.
  168: I see. You have to hide behind a gun do you?
  169: |-
    You're pitiful. Maybe I should just put a bullet through your head right now and end your misery.
     What do you say, would you like a new hole through that brainless head of yours?
  170: I'm sorry.  I really didn't mean it. Please don't shoot me.
  171: You can only take me with a gun? Are you afraid I'll kick your ass without
    it?
  172: 'What?  Are ya afraid of a little girl like me, ya have to use a gun? '
  173: Sure.
  174: 'That''s it!  If you think you know what pain and suffering is, wait until
    I get through with you. '
  175: 'Keep that mutt under control or it''s dead. '
  176: 'Keep you friend out of this. '
  177: 'Keep you buddies out of this or their dead. '
  178: Back off boys, he's mine.
  179: Back off boys, she's mine.
  180: You've disappointed me, I thought you where tougher than that.
  181: 'Hide?  I don''t need to hide behind anything and I do NOT need a gun to deal
    with you. '
  182: 'Keep that mutt under control or it''s dead. '
  183: 'Keep you friend out of this. '
  184: 'Keep you buddies out of this or their dead. '
  185: "(over his shoulder) Back off boys, he's mine."
  186: "(over his shoulder) Back off boys, she's mine."
  187: |-
    Tough words, little man.  Tell you what, I'll put my toys away and
     we'll see who's left standing.
  188: Though words, little girl. Tell you what, I'll put my toys away and we'll see
    who's left standing.
  189: I'm sorry.  I really didn't mean it. Please don't hurt me.
  190: Come and get it.
  191: Okay, but I'd hate to make you cry.
  192: No, thanks.  I don't have the time, bye.
  193: |-
    You'd be wise not to turn your back after what you've been saying.  You should be thankful that I am
     such a forgiving person... this time. Until we meet again.
  194: 'I''m going to enjoy this. '
  195: Just keep that mutt under control or it's dead.
  196: Just keep you friend out of this.
  197: 'Just keep you buddies out of this or they''re dead. '
  198: "(over his shoulder) Back off, boys. She's mine."
  199: "(over his shoulder) Back off, boys. He's mine."
  200: |-
    Cleansing? That's quite nice of you, but 'evil' is very subjective. What or who you might consider to
     be evil could very well be the opposite to someone else.
  201: Yes I agree, but does that mean that we sit around and do nothing just because
    we aren't sure?
  202: That's ridiculous. What's evil is evil.  Anyone who says otherwise is just
    stupid.
  203: Whatever. I was just joking.
  204: |-
    I certainly hope so.  We have enough problems in the world without having a blind fanatic running
     around killing everyone.
  205: |-
    A pity.  A blind fanatic is a dangerous person indeed.  I hope your stay here in the Hub is not long.
     We don't take kindly to murders that aren't auth... to murders of any sort.  Good day.
  206: No.
  207: Nice answer moron.  Who's in charge?
  208: Who does?
  209: |-
    Moron? Do you have any idea who you are talking to? For your sake I hope not. I don't 'run' the Maltese
     Falcon but I AM the one in charge. What do you want before I lose my temper.
  210: I know who you are and trust me, you 'are' a moron.
  211: Oh, I'm sorry.  Who runs this place?
  212: We'll see. Have 'nice' day.
  213: If you don't know, you shouldn't ask.  It can be bad for your health.
  214: In regards to what?
  215: A job.
  216: It's a secret.
  217: That doesn't concern you.  Now show me to him.
  218: |-
    Don't push your luck, buddy, or you'll meet Decker in a bag.  This way,
     and watch yourself.  I'll be watching.
  219: |-
    Don't push your luck, lady, or you'll meet Decker in a bag. This way, and watch yourself. I'll be
     watching
  220: |-
    I think it 'does' concern me and I don't think I'll be showing you anything... that's if you're lucky.
     Now get lost.
  221: |-
    Sorry, but anything you have to tell Decker can be told to me.  I'm his right hand man and there's
     nothing that goes on here that we both aren't fully aware of.
  222: It's about a job.
  223: Sorry, I was sworn to secrecy.  I can only tell Decker.
  224: Well, then you're not going to see him.
  225: Who sent you?
  226: Beth sent me.
  227: Lorenzo sent me.
  228: Loxley sent me.
  229: The Sheriff sent me.
  230: No one.
  231: Beth who?
  232: You know.
  233: She didn't say.  She runs the weapon shop.
  234: Get out of my face.  I don't have time for your games.
  235: Then you'll see no one.
  236: |-
    Tell our friendly Sheriff Greene that Decker's schedule is looking a bit busy and that he should try
     back in a few months.  I'm sorry, but I think you should leave... for good.
  237: I don't think she sent you here.  Please leave.
  238: Did he now?  Are they ready to come under our protection?  Are you one of them?
  239: I don't know what you're talking about.  He just mentioned that Decker might
    have some work for me.
  240: Me? Work for those thieves, never.  I'd rather have to watch my back than my
    purse.
  241: You protect us? NEVER!
  242: Look, buddy. I'm just looking for some good, clean, honest, work.
  243: |-
    Are you?  Well you came to the wrong place then, the Hub is anything but honest.  Go back to whatever
     hole you crawled out of.  You'll be happier there.
  244: |-
    I agree.  Well then, follow me and we'll see how useful you are to us.  Just keep in mind that it would
     be in your best interest to keep anything that is said to you to yourself.
  245: That might be.  Are you a member of their 'Thieves Circle?'
  246: Yes.
  247: No.
  248: |-
    Well, I'm sorry, but we don't work with your little friends.  We barely tolerate their existence and
     we would never work with them.
  249: |-
    Well then.  You might be useful after all.  Just keep in mind that it would be in your best interest
     to keep anything that is said to you, to yourself
  250: He might. What kind of work were you looking for?
  251: Do you need another guard?
  252: Oh, nothing in particular.  I was just wondering.
  253: Anything.  If it pays well, I'll do it.
  254: Anything that won't get me in trouble with the law.
  255: Why don't you try the merchants.  I hear they pay reasonably well.
  256: No, I think we're fine.  Have a nice day.
  257: |-
    Now, that's what I like to hear.  I think we might be friends after all.  Let me show you down. Just
     keep in mind that it would be in your best interest to keep anything that is said to you, to yourself
  258: |-
    Good.  Follow me, but keep in mind that it would be in your best interest to keep anything that is said
     to you, to yourself.
  259: |-
    Sure he did, goodbye... Oh, and by the way.  Don't ever lie to me again, I don't like it when people lie
     to me. Not many people live to hear this advise.
  260: A man of action. I like that, even if you are screwed up in the head.
  261: A woman of action. I like that. Even if you are screwed up in the head.
  262: Yeah, what do you want?  It better be good.
  263: If you want to talk to me you better put your weapon away.
  264: Do you have a memory problem?  Put your weapon up if you're going to talk to
    me.
  265: Your weapon?
  266: |-
    Not bad, not bad at all, you surprised me.  I didn't think you'd be that tough to beat. I'm normally a
     good judge in character, maybe you are what we're looking for.  Are you interested in a job?
  267: |-
    Damn!  That was a good fight!  I haven't had a good match in a long time, and I don't remember when
     I was last bested by someone.  Good job!  How would you like a job?
  268: Sure what's the job?
  269: No thanks.
  270: I can't right now.  Let me get back to you.
  271: |-
    It's not skag work. You'll need to do 'it' quick and clean.  The boss'll give you details, but it's
     more money than you'll make in a month working for the caravans.  I think you'll do just fine.
  272: Sounds good, lead on.
  273: Hm, can I think about it?  I have a lot of other things going on.
  274: " No, I don't think so."
  275: Sure, but let me know as soon as you can.  The sooner the job's done, the better.
  276: Well let me know if you change your mind.  I'd hate to see such talent wasted
    guarding caravans.
  277: |-
    Great, I think things will work out just fine.  Just remember what ever you hear down stairs doesn't
     surface.  Okay let's go.
  278: |-
    I understand that you are responsible for the death of a merchant and his wife. I don't know what
     quarrels you had with them and I don't care.
  279: Who told you?
  280: I don't know what you're talking about.
  281: Wak?
  282: |-
    That is not what you should be concerned about. No one makes a hit one anyone without our okay.
     I think it would be best if you left our city, while you still can.
  283: I'm afraid you do and if you know what's best for you, you should leave this
    city while you still can.
  284: |-
    I didn't think you wanted the job.  I hope it was just a misunderstanding. I'll pay you half, and be
     grateful that I'm giving you anything. [Kane gives you 1500 hubbucks]
  285: Thanks.
  286: Oh sorry, I thought I had the job. Is there chance I can still work for you?
  287: Give me the rest of the money now or you'll regret it!
  288: Ghu?
  289: We'll see.  Downstairs, Decker wants to talk to you.
  290: You will get nothing.
  291: |-
    I don't know what game you're playing but if you know what's best for you, you should leave this city
     while you still can.
  292: |-
    You said you didn't want the job.  I'm surprised you came back here.  You made a bad mistake to do it
     on your own.  I suggest you get out of town while you still can.
  293: |-
    I understand that you are responsible for the death of Jain, the High Priestess. I don't know what
     quarrels you had with her and I don't care, but we're very grateful nevertheless.
     (Kane gives you 1000 hubbucks)
  294: Who told you?
  295: I don't know what you're talking about.
  296: Wah?
  297: |-
    That is none of your concern and I'm afraid we can not deal with you.  You've violated our laws but
     because of the problem you eliminated for us we will not kill you, but I think you should leave.
  298: |-
    I'm afraid you do, lying can be a very unhealthy habit.  You've violated our laws but because of the
     problem you eliminated for us we will not kill you, but I think you should leave.
  299: |-
    I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm not amused. You've violated our laws but because of the
     problem you eliminated for us we will not kill you, but I think you should leave.
  300: Don't touch that door, if you want to live.  I'm the only one that can open
    that door.
  301: |-
    The merchant and his wife live over to the west from here.  They're on the
     corner of Barter Street and Thunder Ave. in the Heights, he'll probably have guards. Try to be quiet about
     it and be sure you aren't seen, but if anyone does happen to see you make sure they don't live to tell
     anyone about it.  Once you've finished your little errand come back here. One more thing.  Don't even think
     about going to the police, that's the worst mistake you could ever make. If you can, try not attract their
     attention when doing your work, they can be quite a pain sometimes. [Kane gives you 500 caps]
  302: Good work.  Here're your scripts for the completion of the first job. [Kane
    hands you 2500 hubbucks].
  303: |-
    Nice work on the merchant.  I'm expecting the same results on your next job.  Here's your last payment
     for the first job and the first payment for the second. (Kane hands you 3500 Hubbucks). I'm sure you
     already know, but the Children of the Cathedral are down south just north of the water merchants.
     Again, no 'live' witnesses.
  304: |-
    Were you in a hurry to get out of here?  You didn't get your scripts.  Here's your money, initial
     payment and the completion bonus for the first job. (Kane hands you 3000 Hubbucks)
  305: "Hey, good work!  You forgot to pick up your initial payment for the job, so
    here it is with the\n completion fee.  You've proven yourself to be quite useful. "
  306: " (Kane hands you 5000 hubbucks)"
  307: And that's all you're going to get.  Now take off before you regret it.
  308: |-
    Here's your starting pay. (Kane hands you 1000 Hubbucks) I'm sure you already know, but the Children
     of the Cathedral are south, just north of the water merchants.  Again, no 'live' witnesses.
  309: |-
    Damn, this is a lot of cash.  Decker really wanted that bitch dead, here're your scripts. (Kane gives
     you 4000 Hubbucks) You've proven yourself to be quite useful.
  310: What the hell do you want?  I thought you didn't want to meet with Decker.
  311: No I didn't, but can you give him a message for me?
  312: Yeah, I want to meet him, so I can blow a hole through his head!
  313: I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
  314: Damn straight, why would I ever want to meet with an idiot like him!
  315: Grug.
  316: Taa?
  317: We don't hire skags.  Now leave before I become annoyed with you.
  318: That depends on the message.
  319: |-
    Tell him that he's a cowardly bastard for hiding in his little cave. If he wants to be a man he should
     try coming out into the real world.
  320: Tell him to start praying for a miracle, because he's going to need it when
    I get through with him.
  321: I forgot.
  322: Tell him that he's my idol, and I admire his work.
  323: Tell him that I'm going to do to him what he did to the last guy who ran this
    place!
  324: Are you now?  That should prove to be quite amusing.
  325: You're an idiot.
  326: What are you some kind of freak?  Get the hell out of here!
  327: |-
    Oh, I'll be sure to tell him.  I'm sure he will be very interested to hear that...  praying did you
     say? You have my 'word', he'll get the message.
  328: |-
    I thought I told you to get lost! My patience is wearing thin!  Are you going to tell me why you
     wanted to see Decker or not?
  330: I don't have to tell you anything.
  331: I'm sorry, I just wanted a job.
  332: I told you, it's a secret!
  333: Nope!
  334: Ru?
  335: When you're off the chems come and see me.
  336: I'll let you see him, but you better watch your mouth... after you?
  337: No you don't.  Goodbye.
  338: That's a secret you'll be taking to the grave.  Decker will never talk to a
    skag like you.
  339: Then I suggest you leave.
  340: Yes?
  341: Lorenzo sent me for a job.
  342: Hi!
  343: I want a job.
  344: Nothing, bye.
  345: Kru.
  346: Hi.
  347: How are you?
  348: Bye.
  349: Fine.
  350: How are the kids?
  351: Nice day isn't it?
  352: You're looking very handsome today.
  353: Bye... (Kane Squints at you, as if he's trying to figure out what you're up
    to.)
  354: I suppose. (Kane starts to give you a strange look)
  355: Do you have the time?
  356: Brahmin Shoe's Are Very Tasty.
  357: No... Did you want something? (Kane seems to be getting annoyed with you)
  358: Yes.
  359: No.
  360: I think you need another drink there, buddy.
  361: I think you need another drink there, lady.
  362: "(Kane waits for a few seconds) Well... what is it? (Kane looks very annoyed)"
  363: What is what?
  364: I forgot.
  365: Oh, nothing.
  366: |-
    (It almost seems like steam is coming out of Kane's ears and the vanes in his neck seem to visibly
     pulsate.) GET OUT! (A few seconds later you can hear again.) ... HERE!  YOU IDIOT!
  367: "(Kane Grinds his teeth and ignores you.)"
  368: You forgot? (sigh) Why doesn't that surprise me? (Shaking his head in disbelief.)
    Now... get OUT!
  369: "(Kane looks at one of the guards and spins a finger around one ear.)"
  370: What the hell are you talking about?
  371: That's NOT the proper response!
  372: I see...  You are not one of them.
  373: Response... to WHAT? (Kane looks confused and slightly annoyed.)
  374: To the secret password!
  375: I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to talk about it.  Good bye.
  376: "(Kane looks angry, you don't know why.) Get out of here, you crazy son of
    a bitch."
  377: "(Kane looks angry. You don't know why.) Get out of here, you crazy bitch."
  378: I told you to get out of here, you crazy son of a bitch.
  379: I told you to get out of here, you crazy bitch.
  380: No, I guess not.  Now LEAVE. (He does not look amused.)
  381: I don't 'have' any kids!
  382: You seem to be a bit upset about that. Do you want to talk about it?
  383: Well you should, they make good servants.
  384: That's not what Mary said.
  385: " Really? That's strange...  Very strange..."
  386: |-
    WHAT? YOU... I... NO!  I do 'not' want to talk about it.  Who the hell do you think you are?  Get the hell
     out of my sight.
  387: I SAID, I do 'not' want to talk about.
  388: Uh, yeah. Sure, buddy. What ever you say.
  389: Uh, yeah. Sure, lady. What ever you say.
  390: Do you have any to sell then?
  391: All right then.  Bye!
  392: "(Kane looks at one of his thugs and shrugs his shoulders)"
  393: No I DON'T!  Now, leave.
  394: |-
    Mary? I don't know a Mary... I don't have 'time' for this! I don't even know who you're talking about.
     If she want's money tell her to come talk to me herself!
  395: "(You gain 100 experience for thoroughly pissing Kane off.)"
  396: |-
    (For a split second you think you see Kane Blush) That's... (he looks side to side) nice.  Now what did
     you want.
  397: 'How about a date? '
  398: Oh, nothing.  Bye.
  399: |-
    Yes, I mean no.  I mean I don't... I can't.  I... (Kane suddenly punches one of his guards across the jaw.)
     What are you grinning at! (Then he looks back at you.)  What are you still doing here!
  400: "(Kane ignores you) What do you want?"
  401: How are the kids?
  402: Nice day isn't it?
  403: This way.
  404: You know the way, let's go.
  405: Open it up boys.
  406: All right.
  407: Okay.
  408: You can want all you like, now take a hike.
  409: Do you have any more jobs?
  410: Hi!
  411: Nothing, bye.
  412: Acru!
  413: Hello again.
  414: |-
    What?  You didn't have the nerve, right? (He whispers to you) Don't worry, you get used to it.  If
     he has guards, try waiting until they leave.  They have to eat some time right? If you can, distract them.
     Do what ever it takes, we don't accept failures.  Just do it and you'll get your money and then you can
     high tail it out of here.  Now... did you really need anything?
  415: |-
    Why isn't 'it' done yet.  You better get it done.  I don't want to see you again until you have some
     good news, otherwise we'll have a problem.  You better not disappoint us.
  416: |-
    That's it.  You've made your last mistake.  You better leave town now, if you don't want to stay here...
     six feet under.
  417: |-
    Well... are you going to do the job or not?  They're right over here (Kane points again at your PIPBoy
     town map display.)  You better hurry up, the boss is expecting this to be done soon.
  418: |-
    WHAT THE HELL... (Kane looks around then whispers.)  What the hell are you doing here?  You better
     finish the other one off, and there better not be 'any' witnesses.
  419: |-
    That's it.  You blew it.  Now you're going to have to pay for your mistakes.  I hope you aren't
     planing on spending the night here.
  420: |-
    You haven't finished your little job. (whispering) You know what's at stake here. You do it and
     you get rich and we're all happy.  Fail and no one's going to be happy.
  421: If you're having trouble with your job, try and wait until she's alone.
  422: You're running out of time and I'm running out of patience.
  423: I won't do it.
  424: She'll be dead very soon.
  425: Huh.
  426: |-
    You won't? Now that's a shame.  We can't have people giving their word and then breaking it. I'm sorry
     we couldn't work together.  Have a 'nice' day.
  427: Okay!  I'll do the damn job.  But you better have the money when I'm done with
    it.
  428: Thanks.
  429: Oh, I'll have it.  Don't worry.
  430: |-
    Still alive I see!  Well, you must not have made any new friends recently.  I hope you keep an eye out
     for them.
  431: "(Kane looks quite smug.  He just stands there with and evil grin.)"
  432: |-
    Well!  I am very surprised to see you alive. You survived, that's very impressive.  I guess I'll let
     you live, you are worth of that much.  Now hit the road.
  433: Don't even think of it.
  434: I never miss.
  435: I'm allowing you to live, be grateful.
  436: I don't think you want to test me.
  437: "\"I hope you aren't planning on using that, for your sake."
  438: You should leave.
  439: Don't be stupid.
  440: You'll regret it.
  441: |-
    You're either brave or 'very' stupid to show your face here but don't worry, we'll stop in sometime and
     say 'hello'.
  442: "(Kane just glares at you.)"
  443: |-
    You survived my good bye party... I don't know how you did it, I must have underestimated you.  Leave
     and you might live.
  444: "(Kane ignores you, but has his weapon ready to shoot.)"
  445: All right!  Out you go!
  446: I won't tell you again.  Get the hell out.
  447: I warned you. Okay guys, let 'em have it!
  448: I warned you. Okay guys, let 'er have it!
  449: Don't bother me, get to work.  You've got a job to do, and you better do it.
  450: Would you get on with it.  I already told you what to do.  Just do it.
  451: I know you finished the damn job.  You don't have to tell me.  Decker's the
    one you need to talk to.
  452: I told you to talk to Decker!
  453: |-
    (Kane gives you a deadly look.) Well then... I'll try to get you in to see him sometime soon.  I'll be
     sure to show you to him 'piece' by 'piece'.
  454: 'I''m sorry you feel that way.  I hope you ''enjoy'' the rest of your stay
    here in our wonderful city. '
  455: "(Kane ignores you.)"
  456: "(Kane stares at you for a few seconds) All right.  I'll give you one last
    chance to see him.  Follow me."
  457: "(Kane stares at you for a few seconds) You missed your chance.  Beat it."
  458: |-
    What the hell are you doing back here?!?!  You must be an even bigger idiot than I thought.  I knew Decker
     shouldn't have hired an unknown.
  459: What are you talking about?
  460: Huh?
  461: |-
    [Kane lowers his voice]  You cocked up the mission, you moron!  You were supposed to kill both of the Hightowers, not wound them for
     Christ sake!  The second you left the Heights they ran off with their guards.  Believe me, they didn't waste time packing either.
      God knows where they are now!
  462: Well, what can I say?  I'm sorry.
  463: Ug.  SOrrY.
  464: |-
    Sorry doesn't cut it.  You've put Decker at an unacceptable risk.  You can consider yourself an enemy of the Underground
     from now on.  I don't ever want to see your face in here again.
  465: You cannot get through the door with Kane here.
VCONDOOR:
  100: This looks like the door to the Vats Control Room.
  101: The door is electronically locked.
  102: You unlock the door.
  103: You short out the electronic lock, fusing it shut. So much for that.
  104: The door is already unlocked.
  105: No luck. You'll need to use electronic lockpicks here.
  106: You fiddle with the lock but can't yet bypass the code. Gotta keep trying!
MLOPS:
  100: You see a technician. He is working diligently for the Unity and the Master.
  101: We do the work of the Master.
  102: We do the work of the Master, and we cannot be interrupted!
  103: Master! An intruder!
  200: You see Viscious, a super mutant leader. He looks mean.
  201: You see a mean-looking super mutant.
  202: The will of the Master prevails. What news do you have for me?
  203: Hng!
  204: Uh, the war goes well.
  205: |-
    I have a message for the Master from his Lieutenant. I must see the
     Master now.
  206: The only news that I have is that you're about to become fertilizer.
  207: An intruder!
  208: Your manner betrays you, intruder. I will end the threat here.
  209: You cannot be serious. In fact, you must be lying.
  210: Uh, yeah, so what?
  211: |-
    I'm not. The Lieutenant could not trust this message to the usual
     method. I have to see the Master right now! There is no time to waste!
  212: |-
    Then use the door, and beware the Corridor. I assume that you have
     your protection in place?
  213: Of course. Thank you. Unity prevails.
  214: No, not really. Should I?
  215: |-
    Of course! You cannot hope to pass the Corridor without it. What did
     you do with your nullifier!
  216: I left it in my other robes.
  217: The Lieutenant did not have time to give me one.
  218: |-
    Ah, humor, I like that. [pauses] I do not have one, obviously. You
     need to go get one from the braindrains on the second level. Unity prevails.
  219: Then he was a fool, or you are not who you seem to be. What is it?
  220: Obviously, he is a fool.
  221: The second part.
  222: Move alone and continue your mission. I haven't the time for you.
  300: There is a small pile of cigarette butts in the corner of the room.
  301: |-
    The super mutant walks to one side of the room, and lights up a
     cigarette.
  302: You see a super mutant with a cigarette dangling from his mouth.
  303: The super mutant flicks the butt into the corner.
WTRTHIEF:
  100: You see a sleepy vault dweller.
  101: You see a vault dweller acting suspiciously.
  102: He seems to be avoiding your gaze.
  103: You spot the water thief!
  104: |-
    You gain 500 experience points for ending the threat to the Vault's water
     rations by killing the thief.
  105: Thanks for solving that case. This will help morale quite a bit.
  106: You gain 1,000 experience points for successfully capturing the water thief.
  107: 'Hello, '
  108: "."
  109: Hello. What are you doing here at this time?
  110: Eaah!
  111: |-
    I was worried about the vault and had a nightmare. I couldn't get back
     to sleep so I thought I'd take a walk to relax.
  112: Okay.
  113: Have you seen anyone else around here?
  114: |-
    I'm sorry, but I'm looking for the water thief and I need
     to see what you're carrying.
  115: |-
    Yeah, some guy was acting suspicious back near the
     water ration room. He scared me. I hope he didn't see me.
  116: What did he look like?
  117: I'm sorry, but I still need to see what you're carrying.
  118: I didn't get a good look at him because I ran.
  119: Okay. Thanks anyway.
  120: Sure. I've got nothing to hide.
  121: "[Search him]"
  122: Don't touch me! I don't have anything. Now leave me alone!
  123: Okay. Sorry.
  124: Would you rather have a bullet in your head?
  125: I stole the water. I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me!
  126: I'm taking you to the officer.
  127: Okay, okay. I've got nothing to hide. Look for yourself.
  128: Well, good night.
  129: Good night.
  130: You find nothing.
EMITER1A:
  100: |-
    You do not see a control panel on this emitter. Perhaps there is another
     way to lower this force field.
  101: You temporarily disable the force field with the damage to the emitter.
  102: You completely destroy the force field emitter and the force field dissapates.
  103: You temporarily disable the force field emitter.
  104: You fail to do anything with the force field emitter.
  105: You enable the force field emitter.
ARADESH:
  100: You see Aradesh.
  101: |-
    Greetings, wanderer. Please do not be offended if the
     gentlefolk about seem rude. As Dharma said, 'Tough
     times tan the human hide.' Your business in Shady
     Sands might be?
  102: Greetings. Your business in Shady Sands might be?
  103: |-
    We don't take to strangers much. Your business in
     Shady Sands?
  104: |-
    I'm from a small village west of here. I'm just
     exploring and mean you no harm.
  105: What's it to you?
  106: My reasons are mine to keep.
  107: |-
    I'm from a Vault to the west. My people are dying
     of thirst and I need to find a water purifier chip
     for them to survive.
  108: I'm saving an entire people from destruction!
  109: Shady Sands? Whoops, I'm lost! I'll just be going now.
  110: Hunh?
  111: I know of no village to the west.
  112: Have you been through the mountains west of here?
  113: So?
  114: |-
    Are you saying you know every location from here
     to the ocean?
  115: |-
    I'm sure you've been many places, but you must have
     missed my tiny village.
  116: |-
    Ah well, to my regret, I have not. Which begs the question,
     how did you make that passage?
  117: It was pretty tough, but I made it.
  118: What's it to you?
  119: |-
    Look, all I wanted was a few supplies and things,
     but I will gladly go elsewhere.
  120: I don't need to answer you.
  121: |-
    Yes, hmmm, yes, yes. yes. I shall believe you...for now.
     But we do not trust easily, especially those who might be dangerous.
     Know that Seth and I will be watching you.
  122: |-
    It is my town, wanderer. You must answer my questions
     or leave. This is not a matter of choice.
  123: I don't have to tell you anything.
  124: I mean you no harm, really.
  125: Don't worry, I'm leaving.
  126: |-
    You are quite insolent. I believe you should leave. Do
     not return. You will not be welcome.
  127: So be it, wanderer. Seth will show you out.
  128: |-
    You must think me quite gullible, wanderer. You
     conquered the mountains by yourself?
  129: |-
    Doesn't matter how I think. It's true I came
     from the mountains.
  130: No, just stupid.
  131: |-
    As Dharma said, 'Caution is life in troubled times.'
     Your origin is not the issue. Your intent is.
  132: Okay.
  133: |-
    I will let you pass, but know this: Seth and I will
     watch you very, very closely. Do not even consider
     bringing trouble here.
  134: |-
    And keep them you may. But this is not a city of
     open hospitality. If you desire that, go to Junktown.
     You may enter, but know we have our eyes on you.
  135: |-
    A Vault. How shall I trust you, wanderer, when you
     are not honest with me?
  136: No, honestly, I come from a Vault!
  137: The Vault is . . . the name of my village.
  138: You're right, I was lying.
  139: Hmmm, yes, yes, yes. Then tell me of this Vault.
  140: |-
    Well . . . the Vault is actually the name of my town.
     We name it that because it's in between two big cliffs.
  141: |-
    It's a big place built into a mountain far to the west.
     My people have been there for the last 80 years.
  142: Why do you want to know?
  143: |-
    Wanderer, I shall believe you . . . for now. You may
     enter Shady Sands, but be warned your every move will be watched.
  144: I will not be lied to, wanderer.
  145: I don't have to tell you anything.
  146: I mean you no harm, really.
  147: Don't worry, I'm leaving.
  148: Hmmm. You may enter. But stay out of trouble.
  149: What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
  150: What's going on around here?
  151: Thanks. Bye.
  152: Greetings again, young wanderer. I hope your stay here has been pleasant.
  153: It's been great. Can I ask you some questions?
  154: It has. I gotta run though.
  155: If you like sewers.
  156: Nuh-huh.
  157: Greetings. What may I help you with this fine day?
  158: Is there something you want?
  159: Can you tell me about Shady Sands?
  160: I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?
  161: Nothing, really, I was just leaving.
  162: Nuh-uh.
  163: Certainly. What do you wish to know?
  164: You may ask, but please hurry. There are more important uses for my time.
  165: What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
  166: What's going on around here?
  167: Thanks. Bye.
  168: Ah. Happy journeys, wanderer.
  169: Goodbye.
  170: I certainly hope so.
  171: |-
    Dharma said, 'A man and his wayward tongue are soon parted.' Come back
     when you have learned some manners.
  172: |-
    That is quite enough, wanderer. Seth will show
     you out of the city. Do not return. Your welcome will not be pleasant.
  173: |-
    Shady Sands is much like a family, one that keeps
     to itself.
  174: |-
    We are a very protective community. As Dharma said,
     'Many sticks can be broken. A bundle cannot.'
  175: What kind of things do you have around here?
  176: Interesting. Are there any other cities around here?
  177: How cute. Well, I better be going.
  178: |-
    The Gardens are on the south side. The Brahma Pens
     are north, although the smell is, I fear, quite intense this time of year.
  179: Anything else?
  180: |-
    We are small and self sufficient so there is little else
     to tell.
  181: Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  182: Thanks. Bye.
  183: It is a small place. You have feet.
  184: Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  185: |-
    Dharma said, 'Heed not the call of the wolf when the fox is raiding
     the hen house.'
  186: |-
    Junktown lies south of here, though there is little in
     the way of visitation. From stories, I'm certain there
     are cities south of that.
  187: Thanks. I . . . Can I ask you a few more questions?
  188: It is a quiet time, thankfully.
  189: Sounds . . . boring
  190: Well, then, can I ask you a few more questions?
  191: Good. Hopefully it will stay that way for a while.
  192: Yes. We like it that way.
  193: What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
  194: What's going on around here?
  195: Thanks. Bye.
  196: |-
    Oh my yes. Great packs of Rad Scorpions are killing
     our herds. We don't know where they're from, and no
     matter how many we kill, there's always more!
  197: Go on.
  198: |-
    And now the monsters are attacking my people! Razlo
     is trying to find a cure for their poison, but I'm not
     sure how it goes.
  199: Well, I'll help you get rid of these things!
  200: I can help you for a price.
  201: That's terrible. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  202: |-
    Ummm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Please talk to Razlo. He
     possesses far more information on these creatures than I.
  203: |-
    As Dharma said, 'Those who tend their own flock,
     know the shepherd.'
  204: |-
    I know it's hard for you to trust, but I would like
     to help.
  205: Your choice. Can I ask you some more questions?
  206: Please hurry and rid us of those Rad Scorpions!
  207: |-
    Things are much more settled now. Razlo has been working
     on a cure for Rad Scorpion poison, and with that, we should be
     able to fight what's left of them.
  208: It was nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?
  209: You don't need to worry anymore. I destroyed the Nest.
  210: |-
    You are truly a hero! Know that the people of Shady
     Sands are most grateful.
  211: Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, though?
  212: Thanks. Bye!
  213: |-
    If you can understand me, please try to find my
     daughter.
  214: |-
    Since you brought my Tandi back to me, things are
     quite fine. My eternal gratitude to you, wanderer.
  215: |-
    What can you tell me about the other towns around
     here?
  216: What's going on around here?
  217: Thanks. Bye.
  218: Yes, yes. Umm. Have a good stay.
  219: Ahh, wanderer. How goes the search for my daughter?
  220: Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.
  221: I'm sorry, but she is dead.
  222: Duh-nada.
  223: Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.
  224: |-
    Slow, but I am making some progress. Can I ask you
     a few more questions?
  225: Guunngggg!
  226: Thank you for trying. Please leave me to my grief.
  227: May my thoughts be wings to your feet. Please hurry.
  228: |-
    Thank goodness you came! I am in desperate
     need of assistance. My daughter, Tandi, is missing.
     I do not know what to do!
  229: Have you tried to save her?
  230: Uhh?
  231: |-
    My people are not skilled in this. Already three patrols
     have gone out to look, but none returned. Will you help me?
  232: Okay. Who could have taken her?
  233: I'll do it . . . for a fee.
  234: I am sorry, but I have other things I have to do.
  235: |-
    Seth and I believe one of the raider clans is
     responsible - retribution for our resistance to
     them. Take this spear. It was found where my daughter
     was last seen.
  236: Okay, I'll check it out.
  237: |-
    Please, talk to Seth. He knows much about these
     raiders. And God speed, wanderer.
  238: |-
    Of course, I will reward you. Bring her and you
     will receive 500 in Hub Script. Will you help me?
  239: Okay. Who could have taken her?
  240: |-
    Ah . . . no thanks. I got other stuff I gotta
     take care of.
  241: |-
    As Dharma said, 'While you are out hunting the
     wolves, do not bring the lion to your den.' If you will
     not help, you must leave here.
  242: |-
    I will be forever in your debt for your courage and
     bravery, wanderer. Here is your reward.
  243: Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, first?
  244: Thanks.
  245: |-
    Until we meet again, my friend. May the water you find
     in the desert not shine at you in the dark.
  246: What are you doing? Put that back at once!
  247: That is not yours. Please do not take it.
  248: Stop that at once!
  249: What are you doing here? I am resting, come back in the morning!
  250: I am he. I lead this humble town of Shady Sands.
  251: |-
    Dharma was a great, religious man. You would do well to
     listen closely to his sayings.
  252: |-
    She is my daughter. It is she that makes this hard
     life worth living.
  253: |-
    Hmm, yes, yes. Razlo is our doctor. If it ails you,
     he can heal it. I would wager he is just a little
     north of here at this moment.
  254: "A fine young man, Seth. Captain of our guards. He\n is likely to be at the
    Guard House. "
  255: |-
    A wonderful woman. She just celebrated her sixtieth
     birthday! She spends much time with Razlo, talking his
     ear off with her veritable treasure trove of stories.
  256: |-
    Ummm, um, um. Very bad. There are two bands of raiders
     that we know of. They call themselves the Vipers and
     the Khans.
  257: |-
    Be very careful with such as these. Raiders who are
     fanatically  religious can be quite dangerous. No one
     here knows of their base.
  258: |-
    Umm, yes, yes. The Khans are nastier then the Vipers,
     let me tell you. These barbarians attack from the
     southeast.
  259: |-
    Mean creatures, they are. Be careful of their tail.
     Their poison can be lethal if not looked after.
  260: |-
    Yes, yes. yes. It is a rumor of a monster created
     during the War.
  262: |-
    Junktown is south or here. Their merchants occasionally
     come to trade, but not often.
  263: |-
    The Vipers and Khans both use spears. We know this from
     their attacks.
  264: You will find it at the front of town. Seth will likely be there.
  265: |-
    No one knows for certain, but the packs seem to be
     coming from the northeast.
  266: I don't know.
  267: I can't really say I have heard of that.
  268: Hm, no. No, I have not heard of that.
  269: As I said . . .
  270: Like I mentioned earlier . . .
  271: Like I said . . .
  272: As I had told you before . . .
  273: |-
    I shall not repeat myself so often as to make myself
     sound stupid. Please listen next time.
  274: |-
    I will not stand here like a sputtering candle simply
     because you cannot listen.
  275: Go talk to Seth about that. He'll know more than I.
  276: "[]"
  277: I will not waste my time on treacherous outsiders.
  980: I don't know.
  981: I can't really say I have heard of that.
  982: Hm, no. No, I have not heard of that.

GENSCRIB:

  103: Sophia sure is nice.
  104: Derek is cool.
  105: |-
    Will the universe continue to expand or will it eventually collapse
     back in on itself?
  106: |-
    I love those old books and magazines, but they are so hard to come
     by.
  107: Knowledge is power.
  108: The pen is mightier than the sword.
  109: Technology must be preserved.
  110: Science is so much fun.
  111: I've seen an alien space ship before.
  112: Did you know the sun is actually a big nuclear reaction?
  113: Did you know a black hole is actually an opening to another universe?
  114: Did you know that the hydrogen atom is 99.9843425% empty space?
  115: |-
    Time travel will one day be possible and we might be able to prevent
     the disaster that ruined our world in the past.
  116: |-
    Research is one of my favorite things to do. I feel like I'm trying
     to solve a mystery.
  117: |-
    Being a scribe is the best. You get to study all the old technologies
     and try to develop new ones.
  118: |-
    These terminals could use enhancement. Maybe we should put the display
     over here.
  119: |-
    Sorry, I'm right in the middle of a possible breakthrough. I can't talk
     right now.
  120: |-
    Hey Initiate. You should train to be a Scribe, if you haven't decided
     yet.
  121: |-
    Us Scribes design all the equipment, weapons, and supplies. It's quite
     exciting.
  122: Please don't disturb me, I'm trying to finish my research.
  123: That's Vree right there, she's also a Scribe.
LEADER:
  100: You see the ghoul leader.
  101: Thank you for not shooting first. Can I help you with anything?
  102: Yes, I'm looking for water.
  103: Sure, who are you?
  104: Nah.
  105: Ahh, if you like you may rest here, we will not harm you.
  106: Ahh.
  107: |-
    I am the leader of a simple people who have left the surface
     because of the others.
  108: Who has forced you down here?
  109: Geez, that's pretty dumb.
  110: Hmm. Ok. Bye.
  111: |-
    The surface of Necropolis and the water is controlled
     by Set and his Ghouls. We are a much more peaceful group - which
     disgusts Set.
  112: Who is this Set?
  113: Well, I've taken care of Set. He won't bother you further.
  114: How then do you survive down here without water?
  115: |-
    Well I sure wouldn't like a bunch of pansies either, Set
     sounds like an OK guy.
  116: |-
    Set is a Ghoul like us, but has assumed a certain amount of
     power in the above ground world. He is an oaf.
  117: He sounds a lot more interesting than you freaks.
  118: Why does he let you survive down here?
  119: |-
    He does not speak of it, however Set is afraid of not having
     enough people to defend Necropolis if it ever needed it. So, he gives
     us what water we need.
  120: Where does all of this water come from?
  121: |-
    I need water for my people! If you know where he gets it
     from, tell me now!
  122: |-
    I am looking for a Water Chip, to give my people the water
     they need. Do you know where I might find one?
  123: |-
    I wouldn't keep you guys around to defend a paper bag. So
     what's this about water?
  124: |-
    Up until recently we pumped our water from the ground, with
     a pump in the Watershed.
  125: Until recently? What has happened that changed things?
  126: How do I get to the Watershed?
  127: What is the Watershed?
  128: |-
    Since our pump stopped working, we have been getting our water
     from a place under the ground. I have heard that a water computer
     is being used to purify the water.
  129: Thanks.
  130: Where is that?
  131: |-
    The watershed is to the north. You'll need to take the sewers
     to get there.
  132: You aren't thinking of taking the Water Chip from us are you?
  133: |-
    Umm.. Me, no, I would never do such a thing. I am just going
     to see how it all works.
  134: Of course, my people need the Water Chip to survive.
  135: Why?
  136: |-
    If you take the Water Chip from us, then we will all die. With
     our water pump broken we need it to survive.
  137: |-
    Well, I really don't care about you and your people. We need
     the water chip for our own survival. Goodbye.
  138: Is it possible that your pump could be fixed?
  139: If that is the case then I can't let you leave my presence alive.
  140: I do not think that I believe you.
  141: |-
    I am sorry I did not mean to deceive you. What is wrong with
     taking the Water Chip.
  142: |-
    Well I don't really care. If you won't get out of my way, I'll
     just remove you myself.
  143: |-
    That may be difficult. The parts needed to fix the pump were lost
     in the sewers under the watershed.
  144: Why is that so difficult?
  145: |-
    Do you mean these parts? (You show the parts you found to the
     Ghoul Leader)
  146: |-
    The sewers there are filled with monsters, and none of my people
     that I have sent to retrieve them have come back. Are you willing to
     retrieve the parts, so that the Water Pump can be fixed?
  147: |-
    Sounds like too much trouble, I think I'll just take the Water
     Chip.
  148: Yes.
  149: |-
    Since you guys are to incompetent to do this yourself, I guess
     I'll have to lend a hand.
  150: |-
    Thank you. When you get the parts, return here. It is possible
     that I can help you further.
  151: Ok, I'll be on my way then.
  152: Have you found the parts for the Water Pump yet?
  153: Not yet.
  154: Nope. And I've decided to forget the whole thing.
  155: Where was I supposed to find them again?
  156: Well I wish you luck then.
  157: |-
    You have returned. Do you have the parts needed to repair the
     Water Pump?
  158: Yes, here they are.
  159: Yeah, but I've decided to forget about fixing the Water Pump.
  160: |-
    Well it looks like you may need some help with the parts. Here
     are some books that we have found littered around. They may help you.
     Now please take the parts to the water shed and repair the pump.
  161: |-
    Unfortunately I will be able to help you no further. Good luck
     with the Water Pump. Please take the parts to the water shed and
     repair the pump.
  162: Have you fixed the Water Pump yet?
  163: No not yet, but I am still working on it.
  164: No, and I am not planning on it now.
  165: |-
    Yes those are the parts I was talking about. Thank the flow
     that you already have them.
  166: Is there anything else I should know?
  167: Well that's as close as they are going to get to the Water Pump.
  168: |-
    As I already told you, they can be found in the sewers underneath
     the Water shed. Go east from here, and then north. You will find the
     Watershed in that direction.
  169: Thanks for the directions. Goodbye.
  170: |-
    Well thank you for that service. Was there something else you
     wanted to know?
  171: How do you survive down here without water?
  172: It is where all the water is stored and handed out to us.
  173: Where is it located?
  174: |-
    Lately I have heard rumors that someone has taken over the
     control of the Watershed. However, our rations are still being
     delivered for some reason.
  175: How do I get to the Watershed?
  176: What is the Watershed?
  177: |-
    Thank you for repairing the Water Pump, and I hope all is
     well with your people when you return with what you have found.
  178: Thank you for your help. Goodbye.
  179: |-
    You have fixed the Water Pump and the flow has returned from
     the deep. However, I see you have not found what you are looking for.
  180: Yes, I cannot seem to find the location of the Water Chip.
  181: |-
    I have heard that it is located deeply below the Watershed.
     I wish you luck in searching for it.
  182: |-
    I see that you have what you came here to find. You realize
     that we will die if you take the Water Chip from us.
  183: |-
    Yes, but I am still working to fix the Water Pump. Where did
     you say I could find the parts?
  184: |-
    I need the Water Chip and I don't have time to deal with your
     problems.
  185: What other options do I have.
  186: |-
    I am tired of putting up with your snide remarks. I do not
     wish to speak with you any further.
  187: |-
    We once had a pump located in the Watershed that pumped the
     flow from the deep. However, it was broken and the parts needed to
     fix it were lost in the sewers directly below the Watershed.
  189: Why have you not retrieved the parts yourself?
  190: You have nothing to fear from us!
  191: I will speak with you before you leave.
  192: You have left me no choice, but to stop you myself.
  193: Wait. Don't shoot!
  194: You have nothing to fear from us!
  195: I will speak with you before you leave.
  196: You have left me no choice, but to stop you myself.
  200: Tough luck.
  201: Can't the water pump be repaired?
  202: I'm sorry but my people need the chip to survive.
  203: Please don't take our chip. Without it we will die.
  204: |-
    Maybe, but the parts are lost in the sewers beneath the watershed.
     With all those monsters there, we can't get them back.
  205: Sorry, I wish I could help.
  206: I'll find the parts.

  1100: He tries to control Necropolis, and has forced us underground.
  1101: He has something to do with the Mutants. I don't know much more.
  1102: We get our water from the place under the Watershed. It might have something
    to do with that.
  1103: The broken water pump is there. Also, that's where the Mutants hand out the
    water from their new source.
  1104: Set's so-called palace.
  1105: City of the Dead, where we would like to live peacefully, if Set or the Mutants
    will let us.
  1106: We get our water from the place under the Watershed. It might have something
    to do with that.
BLADE:
  100: You see a member of the Blades.
  101: Hi.
  102: Hello.
  103: Have a nice day.
  104: Nice weather we are having today.
  105: I wonder if it will rain.
  106: Have you ever seen the rain glow?
  107: Gotta get back to work.
  108: We don't get many outsiders here.
  109: Gotta go.
  110: See ya.
  111: Good day.
  112: Thanks for your help.
  113: We won't forget you.
  114: Nice to have you on our side.
  115: Things are going to be better now.
BVCORE:

    This is the Central Core room of the Vault. It is
     here that the computing machines are located.
CALEB:
  100: This is Caleb, leader of the Regulators.
  101: You see a stern man in his thirties.
  102: You should know that we don't like strangers here.  What do you want?
  103: Good day. May I be of some assistance?
  104: I'm
  105: You have the look of someone important.
  106: Can you tell me a little about Adytum?
  107: Can you tell me what's going on here in the Boneyard?
  108: What's the history behind the Regulators?
  109: Tell me more about the Children and the Followers.
  110: Where can I find Zimmerman?
  111: Have a nice day. Thanks.
  112: |-
    Nice enough town. Me an' the Regulators work hard to keep it that way.
     Anyone in particular you want to know about?
  113: Who runs Adytum?
  114: Who does trading here?
  115: Nothing else, thanks.
  116: |-
    Stay out of trouble, got it?
     I'm Caleb, and that's a name for you to remember,
     'cause I'll be the one comin' after you if you screw up.
  117: I'm Caleb. I train and organize the Regulators here.
  118: |-
    Yah, I guess. You got the Blades up north, a pretty pathetic herd
     of people, and the Gun Runners a little north and a ways to the east
     through the DeathClaw Playground.
  119: |-
    Also, a ways to the south of here you have the Children of the Cathedral,
     who run a hospital an' a big church. Up a little bit to the north and to
     the east you got the loony Followers of the Apocalypse, who are all peace-types.
  120: Stay out of trouble.
  121: You have a good day, too.
  122: You back again?
  123: How c'n I help ya', son?
  124: What c'n I do fer ya', miss?
  125: You'd best keep your weapons put away while you're in town.
  126: Guga gu.
  127: Sorry, but I don't have time for you.  Run along.
  128: |-
    Adytum here's run by Jon Zimmerman. He's an upright fella,
     takes good care o' the town. You should go an' see 'im. Anything else?
  129: |-
    Tine runs a shop over near the gates. It's down below the little bunker.
     He does all th' tradin' with the Hub and with outsiders like you. Anything else?
  130: |-
    We are the police force for Adytum. Most folks 'round here know
     enough not to cause any trouble.
  131: I'm in charge of training the Regulators an' makin' sure that the skags are
    working hard enough, and that no one moves in on us here. Anythin' else?
  132: |-
    Well, the Children of the Cathedral all live in this big
     black church-type building. They have some sort of big god,
     an' they go around tryin' to convert people to their cult.
  133: |-
    You'll find him in the big building to the southwest.
     He might be able to put enough sentences together to let you know
     that we're looking for some help with the Blades.
  134: What's going on with the Blades?
  135: Can I ask you something else?
  136: Thanx for the info. Goodbye.
  137: Sure. What else do you want to know?
  138: |-
    They've done something to Zimmerman's half witted son.
     But like I said, go talk to Zimmerman about it.
  139: Can I ask you something else?
  140: All right I get the picture. I'll go talk to Zimmerman.
  141: |-
    So, Zimmerman gave you the scoop on the Blades. Whatever.
     I'm sure he'll want to know when you've done the job.
  142: Where are the Blades?
  143: Why haven't you guys taken care of it yourself?
  144: Yeah, I'll be back when the jobs done.
  145: |-
    They're all to the north of here. You won't be able to miss their stench.
     Anything else?
  146: |-
    'cause its a waste of our time. I got better things to do
     than get out there and kill a few skags. Take more time showerin'
     up afterwards than dealin' with them. Anything else?
  147: So you're back. Go talk to Zimmerman

  100: You see a guard.

  104: Gahh!
  105: |-
    Well Gahh! back to you . . . I'm sorry that you never learned
     to speak. We might have been good friends.
  106: Ouph.
  107: |-
    I'm not feeling very well. Someone cracked my head
     with a big pipe. I went to the medic but my head still
     hurts. Sure hope someone catches the jerk that hit me.
  108: Why did they do that?
  109: Guck.
  110: |-
    Well, they attacked me while I was here pretty late one night. Usually I go
     home by eight or so, but I was staying late since someone had some water stolen and
     I was checking our supplies. Next thing I know, I wake up in the med-lab with a
     big bump on my head. Things are getting crazy around here.
     Someone is going to get killed for water soon and I don't know what
     we can do about it.
  111: I'll see what I can do.
  112: Sorry. I hope you feel better soon.
  113: Here's your water.
  114: Here's your ration for today.
  115: Hey! What do you think you're doing?!?
  116: Please don't take so many supplies. We need those.
  117: |-
    You log your reports in the library computer system. You should
     return to the overseer to finalize your progress.

  119: "."
  120: Hi. How have things been lately?
  121: Say, what are you doing here?
  122: |-
    Well, everyone's pretty nervous, of course, but we haven't had too much
     trouble. I hope you find a new chip soon.
  123: |-
    I hand out the water rations, of course. And I make sure that nobody tries
     to take more water than their share, though I don't think we'll have any trouble.
  124: Hmm. Well, keep up the good work.
  125: |-
    You too. I hope you find that chip soon so we can all go back to a normal
     life.
  126: |-
    You're welcome to take supplies if you need them, since your job is so
     important, but please don't take too much. We don't have much left.
  127: Can I take some supplies?
  1000: Ration
  1001: Rations
  1002: Supplies
  1003: Water
  1100: |-
    I hand out water rations in the morning. You shouldn't need them, now that
     you are going to be Outside.

    I hand out water rations in the morning. You shouldn't need them, now that

     your mission, but please don't take too much.

    I hand out water rations in the morning. You shouldn't need them, now that

TROPHY:
  100: It looks like a small gold trophy, with a clasp and a bronze plaque.
  101: You successfully steal the urn from the countertop.
  102: You swipe the urn, and hope that nobody saw your clumsy attempt.
  103: |-
    That looks pretty valuable. If you're going to pick up the urn, you
     should be more surreptitious about it.
JEREM:
  100: You see Jeremiah, a messenger for the Children.
  101: You see a Child. He looks pensive.
  102: Excuse me, brother. You startled me. How may I serve the Master?
  103: Quip!
  104: What are you doing?
  105: Ah, yes, a super mutant in training. I will return to my tasks.
  106: |-
    If you do not know, it is none of your concern. If you are inquiring
     about something you should not know, then I will have to report you to our
     supervisors. You should know better.
  107: I am a person of high importance.
  108: I'm sorry to have bothered you.
  109: I am new here.
  110: |-
    Who the hell are you to be asking me questions?! You're lucky I don't
     report you to the holy flame!!
  111: Transferring the reports, of course.
  112: Reports of what? If I may ask.
  113: And a mighty fine job you're doing.
  114: That is all. Thank you.
  115: Very well, then. Peace be with you.
  116: I apologize. How may I be of service?
  117: What is it you are doing?
  118: You can start by answering my question.
  119: You can die!
  120: Guards!!!
  121: It is obvious you do not belong here. Who are you?
  122: I am actually a Vault Dweller and would like to speak to the Master.
  123: Um... Dorpheus... hmm... Morpheus sent me.
  124: I am Loki. An initiate from the south.
  125: |-
    No, I don't belong here. But I know where this bullet belongs... in
     your head.
  126: |-
    I transfer the human purity reports for the surrounding areas. But
     you should know this. [looking suspicious] Who are you?
  127: I was sent here by Morpheus with a message for the Master.
  128: It is none of your business who I am... just answer my questions!
  129: You are not to know who I am, it is the wish of the Master.
  130: |-
    You dare question who I am? Fool, I should strike you down where you
     stand.
  131: That's rather odd... I've never heard of you.
  132: I was sent here by Morpheus with a message for the Master.
  133: |-
    I am of the High Order. Only the Master and Morpheus know of me in
     order to ensure my safety on the outside. But I have been called back by
     order of the Master.
  134: |-
    Please forgive me. I apologize for questioning you. Please carry on
     about your business, and if I can be of any service let me know.
  135: I do not know who you are, and you do not belong here. Guards!!!
  136: Who are you and what are you doing down here?
  137: I am a worshiper and I am lost.
  138: Morpheus sent me with a message for the Master.
  139: Looking for a lonely soul to send to heaven.
  140: Urk!
  141: |-
    You are not allowed in this area. Only Servitors and higher allowed
     down here. Return to the Cathedral proper.
  142: I apologize for any trouble I have caused.
  143: May I ask you some questions before I leave?
  144: OK, but not before I split your head open.
  145: Morpheus would not send a slag like you on such a mission. Guards!!
  146: |-
    You idiot! You are not allowed in this area. Return to the Cathedral
     proper at once!
  147: Akay.
  148: Hunh.
  149: Nah.
  150: |-
    I transfer records for the Master. That is all you need to know, my
     child. Now, you must leave.
  151: I will leave now.
  152: I just wish to ask you a few more questions.
  153: I'll leave. I'll leave. But not until I blow your brains out.
  154: How did you get in here?! What are you doing sneaking around?
  155: I just wish to ask you a few questions.
  156: No, you may not ask me any questions. Now leave.
  157: Stop! You have no business being here!
  158: Duh?
  159: Sorry. I'm lost. I'll leave now.
  160: |-
    But I do have business here. Morpheus sent me on a mission for the
     Master.
  161: |-
    I followed a suspicious looking character down here. Have you seen
     him?
  162: No. Killing is my business and business is good.
  163: No, I have not seen anyone. What did he look like?
  164: Doesn't matter. I think he got away.
  165: It was a short little green man.
  166: |-
    He was about your height but was wearing a leather jacket... What
     do you have on under those robes?
  167: He looked just like you, shit-for-brains!
  168: |-
    Um... I... I... You don't actually think it's m... me?  How ridiculous.
     I've never!
  169: Ok. I'll be leaving then, but let me know if you see anything...
  170: Yes! I do think it was you! Get down on the ground and spread 'em!
  171: No, I don't believe it was you but may I ask you some questions?
  172: Yes, my brother. How may I be of service?
  173: Yes, my sister. How may I be of service?
  174: What is it that you do here, brother?
  175: Just serve the Master. That's all I ask. Brother.
  176: Sorry, wrong guy. All you guys look the same in these robes.
  177: You can serve me by dying, you whacked out bastard!
  178: I transfer the human purity reports for the surrounding areas.
  179: That is all. Thank you.
  180: I would like to ask you a few more questions, brother.
  181: |-
    Yes, and a very important job it is. And do you understand the
     importance of your duties to the Master and all of us?
  182: |-
    Why, yes. I am the one who brings the Master the news of new,
     untainted humans untouched by radiation. I was the one who brought the
     Master the final news of a possible Lost Vault. It may still have pure-straing
     humans in it.
  183: Yes, my brother. You do understand. Thank you. That is all.
  184: I would like to ask you a few other questions.
  185: |-
    You wouldn't know a pure-strain human if he was standing right in
     front of you. Idiot.
  186: |-
    You wouldn't know a pure-strain human if she was standing right in
     front of you. Idiot.
  187: |-
    You act very strangely. I do not believe that you are who you say you
     are. Guards!
  188: |-
    You ask too many questions.  I do not believe that you are who you
     say you are. Guards!
  189: Hey! I told you were not allowed down here! Guards!
  190: You ask too many questions. Who are you?
  192: Excuse me, sister. You startled me. How may I serve the Master?
TANDI:
  100: You see Tandi.
  101: What else is around these parts?
  102: What's going on around here?
  103: Have you heard any stories from down south?
  104: How do you like it here?
  105: Well, that's about it. Thanks for your time.
  106: |-
    Hi!  I heard there was a traveller in town, but I was
     kinda skeptical until I saw you.  My name's Tandi, what's yours?
  107: 'My name is '
  108: "."
  109: 'The name is '
  110: |-
    .
     Remember it.
  111: Uhhh?
  112: Well..how do you like our little town?  Bored yet?
  113: It's okay. Can I ask you a few questions, though?
  114: Hell, yes. There's nothing to do here but watch the Brahma mate.
  115: I guess it's okay.
  116: Well, yes. It is a bit boring.
  117: |2-
     Sure, I guess.  I've never been out of here, so I don't know
     what help I can be.  So, what'cha need?
  118: |-
    Yeah.  Well you don't
     live here.  There's nothing interesting to do, and believe you me, Brahma
     Tipping gets old real fast.
  119: If you're so bored, why don't you leave?
  120: Well, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
  121: It seems nice and safe here.
  122: "Me, leave?  I wish.  I don't know\n enough to leave alone and no one else
    wants to go, and worst of all, my father\n says he would have a heart attack if
    something happened to me! "
  123: Tough situation. Can I ask you a few questions, though?
  124: Shoot, I have to go. Good luck.
  125: 'Uh...I have to stand over here now. '
  126: |-
    You live here all your life and see how you like it!  Anything
     else you want to know?
  127: |-
    Yeah, real safe...and so boring I think my brain's going to
     leak out of my ear at any moment.
  128: Why don't you leave?
  129: |-
    Sorry to hear that, but I don't have much time.
     Can I ask you a few questions?
  130: |-
    Finally!  Someone else who
     sees! Of course, you've probably been everywhere, so this must be hell for
     you.
  131: If you're so bored, why don't you leave?
  132: Well, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
  133: It seems nice and safe here.
  134: |-
    Junktown's to the southwest, but I don't know how far.
     Then there's some weird place below that called the City of Death.  Oh, oh
     yeah there's this other place...Oh, shoot, what was that?  Oh, yeah, the
     Hub.
  135: |-
    There's a bunch of cities down south.  But since you're such a
     great traveler, I'm sure you know that already.
  136: Thanks.
  137: No problem. Anything else?
  300: Wow! This is nothing like Shady Sands.
  138: |-
    We got Rad
     Scorpions!  I mean, I know it's not a good thing, but no one's died from the
     stings.  And it's the closest thing to excitement we've got here!
  139: |-
    Nothing much, since you whomped those Rad Scorpions. Gee, I
     wish I could have seen that.
  140: Same as always.  Bo-ring.
  142: Just stuff.
  141: The weirdest story I've heard is about the Death Claw.
  143: Thanks.
  144: Deathclaw?
  145: |-
    It's okay, I guess.  I mean, it is home and all, but it's so
     boring!  You know, I want to see the world.
  146: If you're so bored, why don't you leave?
  147: Well, I'm sure it's not that bad.
  148: It seems nice and safe here.
  150: |-
    Listen...uh...but I...uh...I-I like guys, okay?  Whew!  Uh,
     excuse me, I got stuff to do.
  149: |-
    I'm not that kind of girl,
     mister. Go find a Brahma or something.
  151: "Well, thanks for talking.\n We don't get many strangers here, so it's always
    good to talk to new people.\n Well, see ya! "
  152: "'Bye."
  153: "Uh, listen.  I have to go take care of the\n Brahmas.  It was, uh, nice talking
    to ya. "
  154: |-
    Hello again!  What
     can I help you with now?
  155: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  156: Nothing. Goodbye.
  157: Uh...hey, thanks. Later.
  158: |-
    Hi!  I was afraid that you
     were gone and I wasn't going to get a chance to thank you for rescuing me.
     Aw!  That was great!  Action, adventure...Anyway, if there's anything that I
     can do for you, you just ask.
  159: How about a few more questions?
  160: How about you and I...well, you know...get together.
  161: Nope, that's it, thanks.
  162: Dungh!!
  163: Who are you?  What do you want?
  164: 'My name is '
  165: ", and your father sent me."
  166: I'm your fairy god-mother. What's it look like?
  167: Duh.
  168: Father sent you!?  Are you here to get me out?
  169: Yes, so just sit tight. I'll get you out.
  170: No, he just sent me to look at you.
  171: Well, what's your plan?
  172: Just wait for the doors to open. Then run for it!
  173: |-
    I'm going to fight the Khan leader in exchange
     for your freedom.
  174: "That's it?  That's your plan.\n Ugh!  All right.  But hurry.  I heard them
    talking and I didn't like their\n plans. "
  175: "You?  Fight him?  You\n got to be kidding me!  [Sigh] Listen, if you come
    up with another plan, let me\n know, okay? "
  176: |-
    Oh, aren't we the sarcastic one?  Are you going to
     get me out, or what!?
  177: Yeah. Just hold on, and when you see the door open, run for it.
  178: I'm going to fight the Khan leader in exchange for your freedom.
  179: |-
    Oh, it's you again! Are you going to get
     me out?
  180: Yes, so just sit tight. I'll get you out.
  181: No, I'm just stopping by to say hi.
  182: Duh.
  183: |-
    Hello, anybody home?  Could you get me out of here?
     Could you GET ME OUT OF HERE!
  184: This is no time to talk, we have to get out of here.
  185: Aradesh is my father.  He's okay, as far as dad's go.
  186: That's me.  Who else did you think it was?
  187: "Razlo's the old guy on the east side of town.  He's a pretty\n good doctor,
    though, even if he is a fossil. "
  188: |-
    Seth's the captain of the guards.  My father tried to set
     us up once, but he is not my type.
  189: |-
    Agatha's the oldest one here.  We all love her, especially
     her stories.  Go by and see her if you want a good yarn.
  190: |-
    Pretty
     bad bunch or so I've heard.  My father knows more about them.  He never tells
     me much about the outside world.
  191: That's where we get all our water. It's been here since before I was born.
  192: "I've actually seen one, even if it was from far away. They're\n nasty creatures,
    with claws and a big stinger.  And their poison can be\n deadly if it isn't treated.
    \ You should talk to my dad, Aradesh, he knows\n more about them. "
  193: |-
    I heard a tale from a traveller up from the south.  He said the
     Death Claw was a creature that killed people at night.  He said no one can
     catch it, because it can disappear like smoke.  Not that I believe it, of course.
  194: "Junktown's a small city to the southwest. It's supposed to\n have pretty good
    trading, but my father won't even look into it.  He says we\n need to stay 'protected'.
    \ Yeah, right.  Caged is more like it. "
  195: "The Hub is supposed to be a great city to the south.  I've\n always wanted
    to see it, but I've never got the chance. "
  196: "I don't\n know, but the guy who told me about it was really scared of it.
    \ He said that\n the undead walked the streets! "
  197: I don't know.  You might want to ask Seth or my father about it, though.
  198: 'Hmm...Doesn''t ring a bell. '
  199: 'Hm...nope.  I never heard of it. '
  200: 'Hey!  What do you think you''re doing?  Put that back! '
  201: 'That''s it!  I''m going to tell my father! '
  202: 'What the hell do you think you''re doing?  Stop that! '
  203: |-
    What are you doing here? You better leave
     before my father wakes up.
  204: Like I said...
  205: 'Listen, I already told you... '
  206: |-
    Again?  Hello?  How many times have I
     have to tell you this?  You have too much wax in your ears or something?
  207: |-
    Oh yeah, I heard of that, but you should go talk to Agatha.
     She'd know more than I would.
  208: Let's get outta here.
  301: Hey, what's that over there?
  302: I can't wait to tell people in Shady Sands about the outside world.
  303: You seen any more radscorpions?
  304: Where are we going now?
  305: When are we going to get there?
  980: I don't know.  You might want to ask Seth or my father about it, though.
  981: 'Hmm...Doesn''t ring a bell. '
  982: 'Hm...nope.  I never heard of it. '

  102: "[]"
  103: "[]"
  104: You see a member of the Blades.
  105: You see a member of the Blades.

  107: You think that might be Scars.
  108: You think that might be Gunner.
  109: You think that might be Twitch.
  110: You think that might be Hammer.
  111: You think that might be Razor.
  112: Get lost! This is only for real fighters.
  113: |-
    So, you think you can take on Tangler and his wimps?
     Here, I'll teach you to use that blade.
  114: |-
    Now you are a little better at that. Go kick Tangler's
     butt into next year for me.
  115: Great job on hacking those Rippers. What can I do for you?
  116: Can you teach me some more blade skills?
  117: How can I get into the Gun Runners?
  118: Nothing, thanks.
  119: |-
    Sure thing. But it will take most of the day for a little
     improvement. You still want that?
  120: Yes.
  121: No.
  122: |-
    There you go. You've shown a little improvement. Good luck
     to you.
  123: Sure thing. Come back when you want more training.
  124: |-
    Seems like we let in a fool. Well, if you want to get into
     their place, there is a slight break in their moat. Look for
     it and run like mad. You may even make it across.
  125: Thanks.
MLPRISON:
  100: You see a dirty, grubby prisoner.
  101: |-
    One prisoner in the second cell is not like the others. He stands
     tall and looks you squarely in the eye.
  102: The prisoner stares blankly at the wall.
  103: The prisoner ignores your attempts to talk.
  104: He looks wildly at you for a moment, and then turns away.
  105: She looks at you for a moment, and then drools.
  106: You get no response.
  107: We're free! We're free!
  108: Your kind is repugnant. Do not speak to me.
  109: Quib!
  110: You don't have the right to speak to me like that.
  111: You don't understand. I'm here to free you.
  112: Do not mock me.
  113: I have no rights, and I could care less. Go away, and leave us alone.
  114: I refuse to tell you any information. Leave me alone.
  115: Hng!!
  116: I'm really here to free you. I'm a normal human.
  117: If you want it that way. Sure. Goodbye.
  118: |-
    Don't you remember that you tried that trick last week? I didn't
     fall for it then, and I'm not going to start now.
  119: What? No cowl to hind behind? Your traitorous nature is self-evident.
  120: I'm here to free you.
  121: Goodbye, then.
  122: You are cruel. Leave us alone.
  123: |-
    I won't spill the beans about my people. You cannot force a man to
     betray himself, you can only force a man to stop living.
  124: You really don't get it. I'm a human being, here to rescue here.
  125: |-
    I don't even have to force you to rot in hell. You're doing a fine
     job on your own.
  126: You're still mocking me.
  127: From the mouth of a man comes the serpent's words.
  128: Right, I could guess that. Go away, and leave us alone.
  200: |-
    The prisoner looks dirty and tired. A collar around their neck is
     shiny and new.
  201: |-
    The prisoner looks back at you with a blank stare. You notice a
     collar around their neck.
  300: |-
    A sign on the wall reads: 'No Entrance. Secure Area. Prisoner
     Handlers Only!'
  301: 'You gain '

VMONOWIR:
  100: |-
    You notice and manage to avoid a monofilament wire strung across the
     corridor.
  101: |-
    You feel intense pain in your legs. You've been sliced wide open by a
     monofilament wire.
  102: It severely damages your right leg.
  103: It severely damages your left leg.
  104: |-
    You disarm the monofilament wire trap and safely dispose of the wire
     before you slice your hands open.
  105: |-
    You try to disarm the wire, but can't get a good handle on it. You pull
     back before it cuts you.
  106: You try to disarm the wire, but slip and cut yourself with it.
RADIOCOM:
  100: 'The computer says: RADIO CONTROL.'
  101: " It looks like the radio channels have been shut down."
  102: " Radio channel control seems to be on."
  103: You switch the radio channels on.
  104: You switch the radio channels off.
  105: You flip some switches but can't get the radio channel selectors to change.
CALDER:
  100: You see a teenager.
  101: |-
    You! You did it! When I grow up I'm gonna get you!
     I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you! You killed them
     all! Aaaaaalllll! [Uncontrolled sobbing].
  102: It was the only way. The only way to stop them.
  103: How in Hell did you survive the nuke?
  104: It's a lie, kid. I didn't do it!
  105: You'd better go find a doctor, kid. You've got radiation sickness.
  106: You know kid, I don't need some tough guy trying to take me out twenty years
    down the road. Say good-night, brat.
  107: I heard about you. You run around the Wastes killing kids! Help! Nightkin!
  108: You're mistaken, child. I'm a good man.
  109: Yeah, and if you don't shut up, you won't live long enough to have nightmares.
  110: I ain't here to bother you kid, so just be quiet.
  111: I do what? They not just small guys?
  112: Okay. I'll be quiet. But I hope the Nightkin get you!
  113: Nightkin! Nightkin!
  114: Maybe it was someone else. But if it was you, I'll find you one day when I
    get older, and I'll make you pay!
  115: Hello, sir. Do you need a meditation flower?
  116: Hello, ma'am. Do you need a meditation flower?
  117: Child, has anything interesting happened here lately?
  118: Of course, child.
  119: Not right now.
  120: Flower pretty?
  121: Get that weed out of my face, you little brat!
  122: I heard Father Morpheus had a visit from the Master himself. He's real happy
    right now.
  123: Anything else?
  124: I'll bet.
  125: Not right now.
  126: Flower pretty?
  127: Get that weed out of my face, you little brat!
  128: Father Lasher says I have to keep my big mouth shut. He's no fun!
  129: C'mon kid. Surely, you've seen something!
  130: Father Lasher?
  131: Fun good.
  132: Sounds like he and I have a lot in common.
  133: That's great! May the Master bless you. [He hands you a flower.]
  134: Aw! You're no fun. Maybe I should tell the Nightkin about you!
  135: The Nightkin are my friends.
  136: You're a little too young to understand how much fun I can be.
  137: Go ahead. And I'll tell them about you.
  138: You start telling anyone about me, kid, and you're dead!
  139: Sure is. I picked it myself from a grove across town. Well, it was nice meeting
    you. May the Master bless you.
  140: What'd I do? What'd I do?!
  141: Are you sure you don't want a flower?
  142: I'll take it if you tell me what's going on around here.
  143: Fine. I'll take it.
  144: Sorry kid. I'm not a flower kinda guy.
  145: Sorry kid. You're a little too young to be giving me flowers.
  146: I dunno. Why you ask?
  147: I can't tell you that! The Nightkin would eat me!
  148: He's my teacher. He says every lash we receive brings us closer to the Master!
  149: What a charming man. We really must talk.
  150: Don't believe him kid.
  151: Where is this bastard? I'll kill him.
  152: Teacher? What need teacher?
  153: And you still haven't learned when to shut up? You must have dung for brains,
    kid.
  154: Uh, bye!
  155: Yeah. It is. Well good-bye_ ur_ may the Master bless you!
  156: But the Nightkin like me! They told me that if anyone bothered me, they'd kill
    'em. So there!
  157: |-
    I heard there's a secret passage around here, but I haven't
     found it yet. Supposed to be real dangerous. Only
     Morpheus and the Nightkin are allowed there.
     Well, I'd better go. Praise the Master!
  158: That's too bad. May the Master bless you anyway.
  159: Please don't tell him I said anything to you! Please!
  160: Don't worry. When I'm through with him, he won't remember a thing.
  161: I won't. I promise.
  162: Mind your own business, kid.
  163: Rar! What you say?
  164: Life is tough. Learn to take it, kid, and quit whining.
  165: But I must! I must! Disbelief is pain!
  166: Please don't! He loves me! He's the only one who does.
  167: That's okay, I guess. May the Master bless you. Bye.
  168: Thank you! Oh thank you! May the Master bless you. Bye.
  169: Okay I will . . . (sniff) Maybe Father Lasher will be more kind to me after
    the Master takes over the world.
  171: And when's the Master going to take over the world?
  172: Tell me more about this, kid.
  173: He won't be. He'll get worse. But if you're smart, make yourself her favorite
    and he'll let you torture the new kids that come in.
  174: Ugh! Me like kindness.
  175: Soon, or so they tell me. We're going to have peace, and unity and the Holy
    Flame will be lit. And maybe Father Morpheus won't be quite so loud, either.
  176: Anything else?
  177: Father Morpheus?
  178: Loud sucks!
  179: Uh, I really don't know very much. Honest. Bless the Master! Bye!
  180: Hi. How are you?
  181: Fine, kid. What's the good news?
  182: Okay. So you got any dirt for your old friend?
  183: Pretty good. How about you?
  184: I dunno. Bored.
  185: I feel lousy. Do you know how long it's been since I killed anything?
  186: Uh, hello.
  187: Hello kid. Can you tell me what this place is about?
  188: Hi kid. What're you doing in this joint?
  189: Hi kid. How're you doing?
  190: Out of my face, brat, or I'll turn you into a belt!
  191: Hello? Rhyme with yellow! Funny!
  192: |-
    This is the Cathedral of the Children of the Cathedral.
     I don't know why they say Cathedral twice. We worship the
     Master, and we yell a lot about Peace and Unity.
     It sounds kind of dumb, but the Master's real smart,
     so I guess it must be okay.
  193: Tell me more about the Master.
  194: Sounds dumb to me, too. What are you doing here?
  195: Don't talk about your elders that way, okay?
  196: What kind of a brainwashed little fool are you? You're going to grow up to

  197: I give out flowers. Every petal is peace, and the stem is unity. Or are the
    petals unity and the stem peace? Oh no, I don't remember! Do you want one?
  198: I'll take one if you tell me what's going on around here.
  199: Sure.
  200: No, thanks.
  201: Screw peace. Screw unity. And get that flower out of my face!
  202: Father Lasher says I shouldn't talk to strangers . . . until we have Unity,
    of course; then nobody'll be a stranger. Bye!
  203: I'm okay. At least until Father Lasher's next lesson.
  204: Maybe if you studied harder, the lessons wouldn't be so bad.
  205: Tell me more about Father Lasher.
  206: What kind of lesson?
  207: Stop whining, you little brat, and be grateful that somebody's bothering to
    teach you!

DEALER:
  100: Hi! Welcome to my previously owned car lot. Which one of these beauties interests
    you today?
  101: You must be joking. These cars are all wrecks.
  102: Uh, nothing, thanks.
  103: Lug!
  104: Oh, I'm sorry, you don't look like you can afford our financing rates.
  105: But, sir, these are fine examples of motor vehicles.
  106: Ma'am, these are excellent vehicles.
  107: They can't be in working condition.
  108: Yeah, right. Okay. Bye.
  109: These cars have been given a full 100-point service by our dedicated service

  115: Where? There's nothing over there.
  116: You're crazy.
  117: What do you mean? They're working on a newly purchased '56 Corvega. An excellent
    buy, I might add.
  118: Okay, whatever you say.
  119: You're just insane.
  120: Bye.
  121: And we have an excellent warranty. You can bring it back to us for any oil
    changes, as well. The first one is free. What do you say?
  122: Throw in a full tank of gas and you have a deal.
  123: You need help.
  124: I'm leaving now.
  125: I'm sorry, we don't have any petrol. Maybe next time. Goodbye.
  126: I'm insulted. I don't have to take that from a customer. Have a good day.
  127: I'm on my coffee break, come back later.

    So.  You're looking for a job.  How fortunate.  I have one that needs doing.  Ahh, but where are my manners?  What's your name?
  104: 'I am '
  105: "."
  106: What business is it of yours?
  107: |2-

    Well, the pleasantries are now concluded.  Do you wish to hear about the job?
  108: That's why I'm here.
  109: Not particularly.
  110: |2-

    Background:  There's a certain merchant who's . . . how to phrase this . . . not cooperating fully with the Underground.
  111: And the job?
  112: "\nQuite simple.  Hunt down the merchant and his wife and exterminate them. "
  113: You mean kill them?
  114: How much for the job?
  115: I can't do that!
  116: |2-

    All a matter of semantics, but yes.  Kill them.  Will you take the job?
  117: Umm, sure -- why not?
  118: No! That would be wrong!
  119: How much?
  120: |2-

    Oh, excellent.  The standard pay is 500 Scripts to open, and another 2500 . . . to close.
  121: Where can I find this merchant?
  122: |2-

    They live in the Heights, on Barter Street and Thunder Avenue.  Complete the job and return.
  123: Okay, I will.
  124: How will you know I killed them?
  125: I don't think so.
  126: |2-

    Quite excellent.  My assistant will renumerate you on the way out.  Please, close the door behind you.
  127: Trust me.  I'll know.
  128: Okay, I'll do it.
  129: Pass.

    I must confess feeling a bit . . . disappointed in you.  But these things happen.  You will remember this is confidential.  Good day.
  131: |2-

    It's standard pay.  500 caps to start, another 2500 when the job is done.  Will you do it?
  132: No, thanks.
  133: Yeah, I'll do it.
  134: |2-

    Very nice.  The merchant lives in the Heights, on Barter Street and Thunder Avenue.  Your initial pay will be handed to you on your way out.

    Everything is my business in the Hub.  Either tell me, or you may leave.

  142: Thanks.
  143: |2-

    Under the circumstances, yes.

    The Merchant Market is in the center of town, surrounded by a number of establishments.  You have the Heights to the west, and Old Town to the east.
  149: What kind of establishments?
  150: Thanks for the information. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  151: |2-

    You're in the Maltese Falcon.  There's also the All in One Store, the Armory, the Friendly Lending Company, the police and, unfortunately, the Children of the Cathedral hospital.
  152: Doesn't sound like you're a fan of the Children. What's up?
  153: Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?

  172: Which is?
  173: Sounds scary. I don't think I'm interested.
  174: |2-

    As you may know, the Children of the Cathedral have been gaining influence in this town, and frankly, I won't stand for it.
  175: So what do you want me to do?
  176: |2-

    A small matter.  Kill the High Priestess, Jain.  Once she's gone, this little nuisance will be ended.  Interested?
  177: Absolutely.
  178: But that would be immoral!
  179: |2-

    I believe I'm beginning to like you.  The pay is 1000 up front and 4000 upon completion.  And trust me, I'll know when it's done.

  183: Well, all right, I'll do it.

  189: Yep, I'm not gonna do it.
  190: Okay, what is it?
  191: Then we have nothing more to discuss.
  192: Exceptional job.  I believe the religious faction shall not interfere anymore.  Speak
    with Kane for your reward.  My thanks -- and I will certainly keep you in mind

    a lesson.

    entertainment establishment in all the Hub.
  206: They steal from the merchants and give to the poor, or some such nonsense.  They
    are inconsequential to me.  That old mutant, Harold would know more.

    find them there.

    end of the Merchant Market.

  146: |-
    I have a sample of the Radscorpion poison, can you do
     something with it?
  147: Luki!
  148: |-
    Sorry, I can't cure any poisons. I don't have the
     proper ingredients to make a decent anti-venom.
  149: Here, let's see.
  150: Yep, just as I thought. Let me get the cure.
  151: You seem fine, now. Be careful in the future.
  152: Stop by again, but stay healthy next time.
  153: |-
    Not too much. They seem to be extremely large versions
     of the north American Emperor scorpion. Contrary to my
     medical knowledge, their poison has grown more potent,
     not diluted, as I would expect. Seth has been hunting them, which helps
     some of my tests.
  154: |-
    And how such a large
     creature can even be possible by natural evolution,
     or even radiation induced mutation is beyond me.
  155: Thanks.
  156: You seem well educated. What are you doing here?
  157: Anything else?
  158: |-
    They seem to be sensitive to light. Nocturnal. If I
     could get a sample of their poison, especially the
     venom production sac located in their tail, I could
     create an anti-venom.
  159: Thanks.
  160: |-
    Doc Morbid in Junktown taught me some. And just
     because we live in stone huts, does not mean we are
     less intelligent or educated. Have a nice day.
  161: |-
    Let me see the sac! Yes, I can do something with
     this.
  162: |-
    Here, take this as a free sample. It seems to work
     well against radscorpion stings, of course, but it
     shows much potential as a general anti-venom and
     poison cure.
  163: It's late. Come back in the morning.
  164: But I need your help.
  165: |-
    I'm trying to kill some radscorpions. Do you have anything
     to help?
  166: I'm looking for Tandi. Can you help?
  167: Hnn.
  168: |-
    Hnn?! What is that? Great, I get awakened by the great
     mumbling beast of the north. Come back in the morning.
  169: Are you hurt?
  170: Yes.
  171: No.
  172: |-
    You will be, if you keep me from my sleep. Now come
     back in the morning.
  173: Great Brahmin! Why didn't you say so?
  174: Uhhh. I did . . .
  175: |-
    You're barely hurt. I suggest a good nights sleep and
     some rest; you will heal naturally over time.
  176: You're barely hurt, you wimp. Come back in the morning.
  177: Ouch, that does look a little painful. That will be $25.
  178: OK, here you go.
  179: I don't have enough money.
  180: |-
    Oh Great Brahmin! That is very, very serious. It will
     cost $50.
  181: OK, here you go.
  182: I don't have enough money.
  183: |-
    How can you still be walking?! This looks extremely
     serious. We'll need some special prayers for this one
     and a lot of luck. Not to mention $100.
  184: OK, here you go.
  185: I don't have enough money.
  186: |-
    You don't have enough money! I'm sorry, but my work ethic
     doesn't permit me to heal for free, you know. Come back
     when you have enough money.
  187: Can you take something in trade?
  188: Thanks for nothing.
  189: Sorry, not today.
  190: |-
    Why would I be able to help you kill radscorpions?
     I'm a doctor, not a warrior. For that you should see
     Aradesh, or even Tandi, or her boyfriend, Seth. Leave
     me.
  191: I need something for their poison.
  192: |-
    If I had a sample of their poison, I could create
     a cure.
  194: I don't think so, I think that she was kidnapped.
  195: Perhaps, I'll go talk to some other people.
  196: |-
    This will take a little bit of time. Come, relax in
     the back. You might have a slight headache from the
     junja juice, as well. Come, come . . .
  197: I have already given you as much as I can. Good luck.
  300: You gain 250 experience points for helping make the antidote.
  301: K, me giv?
  302: Nunga.
  303: Scorpin, Scorpin?
  304: My giv dis?
  305: How about a Radscorpion tail instead?
  306: |-
    Let me see the sac! Yes, I can do something with
     this, as well as heal you for this great gift.
  307: |-
    This will take a little bit of time. Come, relax in
     the back, while I work with the sac. You might have a slight headache from the
     junja juice, as well. Come, come . . .
  308: Please do not take my things.

    They are a lawless group who pretend to be some people from the
     far past.
  1101: |-
    He leads the Khans.  He is one of the most dangerous men that
     has ever set eyes on Shady Sands.  He leads the raider clans with a
     heavy fist.
  1102: |-
    It's 4-6 days to the southwest.  Good trading occasionally, but
     more often than not, they try to stiff us.
  1103: You're standing in it.
  1104: |-
    Much farther to the south than Junktown.  The Hub is the largest
     city I've heard about.  Must be a thousand people there, at least.
  1105: Sorry, I can't help you.
  1106: |-
    She is the daughter of Aradesh.  Some day she could lead us, but
     she must learn to temper her ways.
  1107: |-
    He is the leader of our community, and a true hero.  You can always
     find him at work in the communal hall.
  1108: He works with Aradesh to make sure we are safe.
  1109: That is me. I am the doctor for Shady Sands.
  1110: You're standing in it.
LYLE:
  100: You see Lyle.
  101: So you're the water thief! You traitor!
  102: I'm so glad that the ordeal is over. Thank you.
  103: 'Hello, '
  104: "."
  105: Hello, Lyle. How are you holding up?
  106: |-
    We're doing all right here. But I hope that you find the water chip soon.
     Everybody's on edge and we don't have much time.
  107: Wahnnnngh!
  108: |-
    Not so good. Ever since I had one of my water rations stolen the other day,
     things have been going downhill. Everybody is getting scared and nobody knows
     what to do.
  109: That's too bad. I hope things get better.
  110: I'll take a look and see what I can do.
  111: Yeah, I hope so too.
  112: |-
    Thanks. I sure hope you can get to the bottom of this. And please hurry and
     find a new water chip. This craziness wouldn't have happened at all if we had
     a working chip!
  113: |-
    Thanks for catching that thief. You're doing a good job. But please
     hurry and find the chip, or it won't matter!
  114: How could you betray us like this? Leave me alone!
VALTMED:

    This is the Vault Emergency Medical Lab--EML. It

     might be treated. There should be a medic on duty 24 hours a day.
KYLE:
  100: You see Kyle.
  101: You see a Knight.
  102: Ahh...So you're the one, huh?
  103: What?
  104: Well, who are you?
  105: |-
    Nothing. It's just that no one has ever made it back from the
     Ancient Order.
  106: What do you do here?
  107: What? Then why did they send me down there?
  108: It was difficult, but not impossible.
  109: |-
    Heh, heh. I guess they just wanted to get rid of ya, huh?
     Well, the jokes on them.
  110: Yeah. Say, what do you do here?
  111: Well, the only reason I joined was to get some power armor.
  112: Screw all you guys. I'm leaving.
  113: I fix stuff, run maintenance checks, that sort of crap.
  114: Could you fix a water chip?
  115: What kind of "stuff"?
  116: That sounds like a real good time. I'll see ya later.
  117: Power armor and anything else that needs fixin'.
  118: How can I get my hands on some power armor?
  119: |-
    I'd give ya this power armor right here, but it's missing it's
     Systolic Motivator. It's useless without it.
  120: Where could someone get one of those?
  121: Well, thanks anyway.
  122: |-
    Well, they've got more than enough up in the supply room, but
     Michael and his damn forms say that this particular suit isn't up to
     specs. Damn bureaucrats.
  123: What do you mean, not up to specs?
  124: |-
    So if I brought you a Systolic Motivator, would you fix it for
     me?
  125: |-
    You see this eye-piece right here? I had to re-solder it in
     place, and it don't look as pretty as it needs to for inspection, I
     guess.
  126: |-
    You're right. That looks like crap. I wouldn't be caught
     dead in that power armor.
  127: Get the hell out of here, buddy.
  128: |-
    Whoa, wait a minute there, fella, that would take a good
     coupla hours. I'd loan you a manual and my tools, but you'd hafta
     repair it yourself.
  129: Well, besides Michael, where else could I get one?
  130: That's fair. I'll be back.
  131: |-
    Heh, well, Rhombus has a couple of 'em. I wouldn't ask him
     for one, though. Only "the Honored" are supposed to wear these here
     power suits. Besides, I think he has an unnatural attachment to them.
  132: Hmm. Okay, thanks a lot.
  133: I don't think so. Don't even know what one is.
  134: Thanks anyway.
  135: |-
    What kind of weak mechanic are you, can't even fix a water
     chip?
  136: |-
    How can I get some power armor without studying for a hundred
     years?
  137: The moniker's Kyle. I've never met a myth before.
  138: What's that supposed to mean?
  139: What do you do here?
  140: Neither have I. I'll see you around.
  141: |-
    To hear Maxson's stories you'd think it was the ninth level
     of hell.
  142: Maxson? General Maxson?
  143: |-
    Not General Maxson, his grandfather, Roger Maxson. I heard you
     brought back a disk that told what happened to the guys who rebelled
     against him and went down there to recover the lost technology.
  144: 'Yeah, I guess I did. I''m '
  145: ", who're you?"
  146: I'd rather not talk about it.
  147: |-
    Yeah, lousy bastards. I can't believe they sent you down there
     like that.
  148: And all they gave me for my trouble was a handful of ammo!
  149: Hey, initiate, got anything for me?
  150: No, I told them you sent me and he wouldn't give me the part.
  151: No I haven't even looked into it yet.
  152: No luck yet.
  153: |-
    No shit. And here I thought you was smart. I told ya that guy
     had official forms for brains.
  154: Watch who you call an idiot.
  155: I was just tryin' to talk it out of Michael.
  156: What can I do if Michael won't give it to me.
  157: I'm going.
  158: |-
    Wella... I got to give you credit for that. But I think you blew
     your chances with getting it from the supply room. You'll just have to
     find another way to get it. Or find yourself Power Armor somewares else.
  159: OK, see you later.
  160: Where else can I dig one up?
  161: Good luck.
  162: Get lost, I'm busy.
  163: Hello, were you able to get that part?
  164: Yes. Here it is.
  165: Yes, but I think I'll hold on to it a little while.
  166: Great! Here just let me install this into the unit.
  167: |-
    OK you're all set to go. Here take this manual. If you have any
     kind of aptitude with repairing things you should have no problem.
     Good Luck.
  168: |-
    After all that? Okay, just let me know when you want me to put
     it in. Then you can get started on repairing it.
  169: |-
    Well, I don't know what to tell you. I guess you need to
     polish up your repair skills a little. I'll keep the unit here for ya.
  170: Ok. Thank you. Good bye.
  171: Hello agin. Can I help you?
  300: "[more]"

GENRAIDB:

  101: Kill or be killed!
  102: Enjoy your victory, and pray to your gods that we never meet again!
  103: I have no time for talk!
TALUS:
  100: You see Talus.
  101: |-
    Hello, you must be the outsider initiate. Nice to meet you.
     What can I do for you?
  102: Who is the leader of your organization?
  103: So, are you in charge around here?
  104: How do I get better weapons and equipment?
  105: Chagga!
  106: |-
    That would be the council of elders. More specifically, the
     High Elder, Maxson. The elders make all the major decisions
     around here. If you need to speak with them, you'll find them
     on the fourth floor.
  107: So what do you do?
  108: |-
    No, we are directed by the council of elders. Maxson, the High
     Elder, would be the person in charge. If you need to speak with
     him, you'll find him on the fourth floor.
  109: I really need some better firepower.
  110: |-
    I'm the Senior Paladin, Rhombus's right-hand man. We're in charge
     of the Paladins and Knights. Right now I'm supervising training
     exercises. We're getting ready . . . for anything.
  111: You're getting ready for what?
  112: How can I get some weapons and equipment?
  113: |-
    There are rumors of a large force moving around in the mountains
     and desert. With the missing caravans and these rumors, we're just playing
     it safe.
  115: Really? Okay, thanks.
  116: |-
    In a hurry, are we? As an Initiate, you are entitled to a few
     things. I'll put in a clearance for combat armor and three orders
     for ammunition, bullets of your choice. Just see Michael in the
     next room for the supplies.
  117: |-
    I am very grateful, but do you by any chance have a weapon you
     can spare that might help my chances of survival out there?
  118: Thanks, what about some high-tech weapons?
  119: That's it? You've got to be kidding!
  120: |-
    I understand, but I'm really pressed for time and I really need
     some better firepower.
  121: Great! What do I have to do now? Climb the highest mountain?
  122: That sounds great. Why don't you start now.
  123: |-
    Well, I might be able to make an exception. You obviously have
     some good training. If you didn't you wouldn't have succeeded
     in that crazy quest the High Elder sent you on.
  124: |-
    Sometimes I don't know if he's trying to get help from the
     outside, or kill off the stupid. No offense. I'll tell you
     what. I'm sort of in a tight spot because the scouts I
     sent out a while back never returned.
  125: |-
    It was my idea, and I'm sort of taking some heat for it.
     If you can find out what happened to them, I'll make it
     worth your while.
  126: I'll think about it.
  127: |-
    Excuse me, Initiate. Please don't brandish your weapon. Put it
     away unless you plan on using it.
  128: |-
    Holster your weapon, Initiate. You're not in a training exercise,
     put it away.
  129: |-
    Would you stop waving your weapon around like that?
     You should . . . oh, never mind.
  130: 'Hello again, Brother '
  131: ". How can I help you?"
  132: Who are the important people around here?
  133: Could you tell me about those important people again?
  134: How can I get some better equipment and weapons?
  135: Can I get some more ammo?
  136: Nothing, thanks.
  137: |-
    I can help you with that. As an Initiate, you are entitled
     to a few things. I'll put in a clearance for combat armor and
     three orders for ammunition, bullets of your choice.
  138: Just see Michael in the next room for the supplies.
  139: What about that metal suit you're wearing?
  140: Thanks, what about some high-tech weapons?
  141: Well, we are all important, but I know who you are referring to.
  142: |-
    That's not a problem. You should get to know your fellow Brothers
     well. I know there are a lot of us, and that it can be hard
     for some to remember us all.
  143: |-
    There's Rhombus. He's our Head Paladin, also known as the Master
     Knight. Then there's Vree; she's the Master Scribe. And of course
     we cannot forget our distinguished High Elder, Maxson.
  144: Tell me about Rhombus.
  145: Tell me about Vree.
  146: Tell me about Maxson.
  147: |-
    Rhombus is my best friend, mentor, idol, and father figure all
     combined into one. He's a little rough, but he has to be,
     to be in the position he's in.
  148: |-
    If you ever need to talk to him, he is normally in his office . . .
     I mean room. That's on the other side of this level, across from
     the guard room.
  149: Of course we do. She's on the second level. Next to the learning room.
  150: Thanks, bye.
  151: Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.
  152: |-
    Vree is one of the most intelligent people I've ever known.
     I think she was born with the natural understanding of physics and chemistry.
  153: |-
    She spends every waking moment doing research or analyzing and
     reanalyzing anything she can get her hands on. If you ever need
     to talk to her, she can normally be found in her room, on the third floor.
  154: |-
    She's on the second level. Just go down to the second floor, make
     a left. You'll see it just past the learning room. I should get back to
     work. If you have any other questions just ask.
  155: |-
    As I said, she's on the second level. You can't miss it. It's the
     only other major room on the second floor besides the learning room.
  156: Okay, see ya.
  157: |-
    Maxson is one tough old man. He's the great, great grandson . . .
     or was it great, great, great grandson? Well, anyway. He's the
     descendant of one of our founding fathers. He, of course, is the
     High Elder.
  158: |-
    You've built quite a reputation for yourself. The people I've
     checked with hold you in high regard. I don't think you need any help,
     you seem quite capable. However, if you help me with a little problem,
     I might be able to reward you with something.
  159: Thanks a lot, bye.
  160: That's it, thanks.
  161: You're getting on my nerves, little one. What do you want now?
  162: Nothing, just wanted to hear your pleasant voice.
  163: Sorry, didn't see you there.
  164: Cha Toh Weh Lo!
  165: Ug.
  166: Stop wasting my time!
  167: How did you get in here? Get out of my sight.
  168: |-
    I can give you a little more ammunition if you really need
     it. I'll have it authorized by the time you can talk to Michael.
  169: |-
    I just gave you some. You should learn to be more
     conservative with your ammunition.
  170: |-
    Sorry, you've had more than your share for this week.
     You'll have to make do with what you have. We don't have an endless
     supply of ammunition.
  171: |-
    I've heard about some of the things you've done and we don't
     take kindly to child killers. The Elders seem to think that there's
     something you can offer but I don't want to have anything to do with
     you.
  172: I only killed one.
  173: You don't know the whole story.
  174: I don't have to answer to you.
  175: |-
    You've built quite a reputation for yourself. I don't think
     you need any help, you seem quite capable. However, there is something
     I need looking into, and I might be able to help you if you can help
     me.
  176: Sure. What's the problem?
  177: No thanks and thanks for nothing.
  178: Sorry, I can't. Thanks for the Armor, though.
  179: |-
    Since you were able to survive the wasteland alone, I think
     you're probably quite capable. However, I do have a problem that I
     could use some help with and I might be able to reward you for your
     help.
  180: No. I think you should leave.
  181: |-
    I sent one of our Initiates out to the Hub a short while back
     and we haven't heard back from him. If you can find out what happened
     to him I'd be very grateful.
  182: I'll check it out.
  183: I'll try but I can't promise anything.
  184: I told you to leave.
  185: Only? I don't think our order will be able to help you. Good day.
  186: I don't need to know the whole story. Good day.
  187: |-
    Thank you. I'll remember this and when I've seen that you've gained
     enough experience I might be able to give you something special from our
     order.
  188: Really? What?
  189: Give it to me now!
  190: Sounds good. Bye.
  191: |-
    I shouldn't say, but it's not a weapon. It's something that only
     the elite in our order can have, but since you are from the outside and
     are in greater need of it, I might be able to make an exception.
  192: Can't you tell me?
  193: Okay, bye.
  194: I think you probably already have an idea. Let's leave it at that.
  195: No, I'm not and I think you should leave, 'initiate'.
  196: |-
    Only Paladins wear Power Armor, someday you may earn the right to
     wear it.
  197: Thanks, what about some high-tech weapons?
  198: |-
    Well I see we have a bright new addition to our order after all...
     [Talus leers at you.] Don't get cocky with me, Initiate. I'm not in the
     mood nor have I the patience!
  199: |-
    I thought you were smarter than that. I don't have to give you
     anything. You're lucky I don't kick you out of here, right now. I think
     you should leave, before I change my mind.
  200: That's okay. Anything you might find would be helpful.
  201: 'Brother '
  202: |-
    ! I've received word from Brother Jonathan. Thank you for rescuing
     him.
  203: |-
    I understand Decker's dead, you're more talented than I thought,
     and that's saying a lot.
  204: We'll make Decker pay for what he's done, you have my word on that.
  205: You're welcome.
  206: Lup?
  207: |-
    Hello stranger! I heard you're the one to thank for the safe return
     of my missing Initiate.
  208: |-
    I also understand that Decker's dead, you're quite an asset to our
     Brotherhood.
  209: |-
    We don't tolerate chem users around here. I suggest you see the
     doctor and clean yourself up.
  210: 'As for your reward, I''ll give you the choice of one of the following:'
  211: So which would you prefer?
  212: Rocket Launcher.
  213: Laser Pistol.
  214: Super Sledgehammer.
  215: Let me think about it.
  216: I'll key your authorization in right now. Go pick it up from Michael.
  217: |-
    , it is time you wore your own suit of Power Armor. This is a very
     special privilege for one so new to our order. Wear our Power Armor as a
     symbol of hope as you walk the wasteland, for someday when the world is
     ready we will surface and restore our battered Earth. Congratulations, you
     have made us all very proud. I'll send Michael the authorization.
  218: |-
    I see someone else already gave you your Power Suit. I was hoping
     to give it to you myself, but that's all right. I hope it helps you in
     your quest.
  219: Watch your form!
  220: Pay attention, people.
  221: No slacking off!
  222: Behave over there, or you'll find yourself on night perimeter patrol.
  223: Quiet, don't make me bring Rhombus in here. He'll whup all your asses.
  300: Please, if you need something see me in the morning.
  301: I'll be in the training hall come morning. Talk to me then.
  302: What are you doing in her. These aren't your quarters.
  303: |-
    Good night Initiate, talk to me in the morning. It can't be that
     urgent.
  304: I'm tired and I want to go to bed, please leave.
  305: Do you normally bother people in there living quarters.
  400: |-
    You can always... wait a minute. Look me straight in the eyes...
     I thought so. You should lay off the chems, they can really mess you up.
     If you don't watch it you'll end up like the Skags at the Hub. So what
     was it you needed?
  401: Do you have a doctor? I'm hurt.
  402: Do you have a doctor?
  403: I'm done climbing that mountain.
  404: Where's your doctor located?
  406: |-
    Hmmm, I don't know. You may have proven yourself to be an initiate
     but that doesn't mean we start handing over weapons to someone that might
     not be qualified, especially an outsider, no offense.
  407: Power Armor.
  408: 'You gain '
  409: " experience points for rescuing the initiate."
GENGRDA:
  100: Boy, it sure is hot.
  101: I could use a drink.
  102: These trips sure are long.
  103: I hope we don't run into any raiders.
  104: I really need the money from this job.
  105: I hate this job.
CABBOT:
  100: You see Cabbot, an Initiate of the Brotherhood of Steel.
  101: |-
    Hello and welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel.
     May I ask your business here?
  102: Who're you?
  103: Can I ask you a few questions?
  104: Uhhh?
  105: I'd like to join.
  106: What do you do?
  107: Never mind, thanks.
  108: "Uh, I'm Cabbot, but uh, you didn't answer me. What can\n I do for you? "
  109: Can I ask you a few questions?
  110: Oh yeah, as if you'd like to know.
  111: I'd like to join.
  112: What do you do?
  113: Never mind, thanks.
  114: That's great! Uh, W-Wait here a second and let me see what you need to do!
  115: "Uh, well, I talked to the High Elder, and he said that not just anyone can\n
    join. He, um, he said you have to complete a quest first. "
  116: Like what?
  117: Never mind, see you later.
  118: Did you do a quest before you joined?
  119: 'Uh, not exactly. But things are a bit different right now. '
  120: So what's the quest?
  121: So tell me what's different.
  122: Never mind then, I'll come back another time.
  123: |-
    You have to go to the ruins of the Ancient Order. That's south
     of here. Uh, you've gotta go inside and bring back something that
     proves that you were there.
  124: How will you know if it is from inside this place?
  125: Okay.
  126: No way in hell.
  127: |-
    This place is high tech. There's things inside like you've never
     seen before. Oh, uh, it's also radioactive. Aheh.
  128: Okay, I'll do it.
  129: Sounds scary. Count me out.
  130: You'll do it? You will? Great! Just bring it back here! Good Luck.
  131: 'Oh . . . okay, then.  Goodbye. '
  132: Well uh, I'm an Initiate. Right now, my job is to greet people at the door.
  133: |-
    Doesn't sound terribly exciting, but I still want to
     join the Brotherhood.
  134: Okay, thanks. See you around.
  135: Can I ask you a few questions?
  136: Well uh, I have to ask. It's my job.
  137: Can I ask you a few questions?
  138: Can I join the Brotherhood?
  139: I don't have to tell you anything. Go get your commander.
  140: Well then, I'll just be going now.
  141: I'm sorry, I really can't. Th-They said not to. Goodbye!
  142: 'No! Go away! '
  143: Well, hello again. You decide what you wanted?
  144: Hello. What do you need now?
  145: I've changed my mind. I want to join the Brotherhood.
  146: Can I ask you a few questions?
  147: Never mind. Goodbye.
  148: 'You''re making fun of me, aren''t you? Good-bye! '
  149: Go away!
  150: Please, I'm sorry I made you angry. Can we try again?
  151: Okay.
  152: No! I think you're just lying to me. Goodbye!
  153: Hmmm. All right, I'll believe you for now. So what do you want?
  154: I've changed my mind. I want to join the Brotherhood.
  155: Can I ask you a few questions?
  156: Never mind. Goodbye.
  157: Hey! You're back! Did you get something?
  158: Yep, sure did.
  159: No, I didn't yet.
  160: |-
    Great! But . . . um . . . the High Elder said you have
     to give it to me first before you can be let in. Sorry.
  161: Okay.
  162: No, I don't want to.
  163: This is great! Hang on while I open the door.
  164: OK.
  165: Hmmm . . . Sorry, but, uh, this could have come from anywhere.
  166: But . . .
  167: |-
    Alright, so I'm gonna let you in. But I'm gonna tell ya' what's going on
     after I do that. Alright? I'll be in the guard room. You can let yourself out, but I have
     to let you back in. Oh, and the High Elder wants to speak with
     you in the war room. It's on the third floor.
  168: You don't need to lie. Just come back when you have something.
  169: Well, let me know when you do.
  170: Hello! You want back in?
  171: Are you coming back in?
  172: You want back in?
  173: Yes, please.
  174: If you'd open the gate.
  175: Great! See you around, huh?
  176: Fine.
  177: Okay.
  178: What exactly do you do?
  179: Heard any good rumors lately?
  180: Goodbye, Cabbot.
  181: Go ahead.
  182: Well hello! What can I help you with?
  183: What do you need?
  184: Can I help you with something?
  185: Can I ask you a few questions?
  186: Never mind. Goodbye.
  187: Goodbye.
  188: |-
    I greet people at the gates and decide whether to let them in. You
     and the merchants are about the only ones that get in now, because the
     Elders seem like they're preparing for something.
  189: Do you know what it could be all about?
  190: Why do you let the merchants in?
  191: "Uh . . . I don't know, but uh, I've heard the High Elder arguing with the
    other\n Elders. "
  192: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  193: Thanks. I'll see you around.
  194: |-
    Why do I let 'em in? Well . . . we have to get our food and other things.  We trade our weapons for
     all that.
  195: Why don't you just grow food yourselves?
  196: Can I ask you a few more questions?
  197: Thanks. I'll see you around.
  198: |-
    Uh, well, the purpose of this place is to make Scribes and Knights. Anyone
     who wants to be something else just leaves.
  199: Oh. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  200: Thanks. I'll see you around.
  201: |-
    Well, some of the Initiates think we're preparing for war. That's why
     hardly anyone gets in now. I was surprised when the High Elder
     told me to let you in.
  202: Why?
  203: Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
  204: Thanks for the info. I'll see you around.
  205: I don't think that belongs to you.
  206: I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to go tell the guards.
  207: I don't think you should be doing that.
  208: Oh, okay. Whatever.
  209: As I said . . .
  210: Well, as I said . . .
  211: As I've said before . . .
  212: Well, it's like I said . . .
  213: |-
    Now, um, I ha- I hate to be rude, but I don't like to repeat myself.
     Okay?
  214: |-
    Um, ya know, I really don't have time to sit here and repeat
     myself over and over again. You can understand, can't you?
  215: Well, that's me.

    She's the head of the Scribes. She's usually in the library.
     Go down into the basement and uh, it's on your right hand side.
  217: |-
    The knights say he can be a tough taskmaster, but I don't
     personally, because uh, I'm studying under Vree to become a Scribe.
  218: |-
    General Maxson used to be Master Knight. I don't think he
      likes being High Elder much.
  219: |-
    They make all the decisions around here, from what we eat to what
     our duties are. And uh, they argue a lot, too. The High Elder seems to have
     to step in a lot.
  220: |-
    OK, well, scribes are the keepers of all the histories and the blueprints
     for the weapons we make. I just love books; that's why I want to
     be one . . . a Scribe, that is.
  221: |-
    Well, you see, they're the ones who want to become protectors
     of the Brotherhood. There's not many of them, but they train their
     whole lives to become Paladins.
  222: |-
    That's the town to the south, right? We get the merchants here all
     the time, but I've never been there myself. Gee, I wouldn't know
     what to do in a big city like that.
  223: You should talk to Vree, I think. She'll tell ya' about 'em.
  224: |-
    They trade with us for food and stuff. We give them weapons.
     They don't come around too often anymore, but uh, I don't know why.
  225: |-
    Whoa, that's a long story. Go to the library and talk to Vree.
     She'll be able to show you where the history CDs are.
  226: |-
    Oh, well, in the Exodus, the Brotherhood split into two groups.  The
     group that broke away robbed the others of some of the weapons
     an-and they went south.  Then about ten years ago we sent out knights to look
     for them and all they found was ruins.  No one knows what happened.
  227: "The ancient Brotherhood came from some place far up north a long,\n long time
    ago. We call this the great Exodus. You can read about\n it more if you ask Vree
    in the library. "
  228: Uhh . . . I don't know anything about that.
  229: |-
    Hmm . . . I don't know. You might want to ask someone more important
     than me.
  230: I don't know what that is. You might want to ask around.
  231: Go talk to Mathia. She'll tell you more about that.
  232: You get 2000 experience points for becoming an initiate.
  233: We don't want your kind here. Go away!
  980: Uhh . . . I don't know anything about that.

  101: Hello and welcome to the Far Go Traders. How may we help you?
  102: Can you transport water?
  103: I'm here about the job that was posted.
  104: I'm looking for work.
  105: What is it that you do here?
  106: You can't. Bye.
  107: Gak!
  108: We don't hire Skags! Get out.
  109: |-
    Hmmmm. It's a shame you don't have the brains to go with that brawn. We could have used someone like
     you.
  110: Well, we 'can' transport water, but it will cost you. How much do you need
    and where is it going?
  111: I need enough to supply a vault. It's up north, past Junktown, in the mountains.
  112: I need enough to supply a vault. It's up north, in the mountains.
  113: I need it all! Some day, I'm going to transform the face of the planet. You'll
    see!
  114: |-
    A whole vault? Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of access to that much water. Plus, I wouldn't
     want to go into those mountains. We've had enough missing caravans.
  115: You don't? Is there someone else who can?
  116: Well, what about the job posted?
  117: Well, do you have any work?
  118: Well, thanks for nothing.
  119: |-
    Oh sorry, you're not from around here. The Water Merchants handle all the damn water in this town.
     I wouldn't even bother trying to deal with them. They're a bunch of vultures.
  120: Where would I find them?
  121: Ok, thanks.
  122: You can't miss them. They're south of here, all barricaded in with that damn
    water tower.
  123: So, what do you do around here?
  124: Ok, thanks.
  125: |-
    I'm in charge of the...I mean, I help run the Far Go Traders. If anyone messes with us, I'm the one
     they will answer to. We trade wares between all the different settlements.
  126: I already told you.  Butch and I run the Far Go Traders.  Now what did you
    want?
  127: What sort of things do you trade?
  128: Interesting. Bye.
  129: Great. What about that job that was posted?
  130: Sounds good. Do you need help?
  131: 'Why, we trade just about everything you can think of: chems, tires, guns,
    bullets, food, brahmin, dirt, even scraps of metal.'
  132: Dirt? Scraps of metal?
  133: Uh...that's fascinating, but I gotta go.
  134: You'd be surprised at what's in demand out there. Something that's taken for
    granted in one place may be a highly sought after commodity in a settlement 10
    miles away.
  135: Ok, enough with the boring merchant chatter. Where's the door?
  136: Thanks, bye.
  137: Can you tell me about the job that was posted?
  138: Do you have any work?
  139: I hear that you're a little crazy, but that might be what we need right now.
    You'll need to talk to Butch. He likes to meet all the new recruits. He's in the
    room right behind me. Go on in.
  140: I don't think I want a child killer on one of my caravans.
  141: Child killer? But it was an accident.
  142: Hey, I don't discriminate. If it gets in my way, regardless of age, they'll
    be a wet spot on the wall.
  143: I guess accidents do happen. It is a pretty messed up world out there. I'm
    still not sure I trust you. Go ahead and talk to Butch. He's in that room right
    there.
  144: My ass it was an accident. I know your type. Think you can do whatever you
    want. Well, not around here, buddy. Go ahead and talk with Butch, but I'll be
    keeping an eye on you. He's right through the door right behind me.
  145: My ass it was an accident. I know your type. Think you can do whatever you
    want. Well, not around here, lady. Go ahead and talk with Butch, but I'll be keeping
    an eye on you. He's right through the door right behind me.
  146: You are one ruthless son of a bitch. We might need that, but that doesn't mean
    that I agree with your ways. Just don't touch a child around me, or you'll be
    the wet spot on the wall. Go ahead and talk to Butch. He's in the office right
    behind me.
  147: You're looking for work? I've heard good things about you. We can always use
    someone of your reputation. Go on in and talk to Butch. He's through the door
    behind me.
  148: You're looking for work, are you? You look alright. Well, you should probably
    talk to Butch. He's through the door behind me.
  149: I thought you didn't want the job. What do you want?
  150: I don't. I just had to have one more look at that ugly mug of yours.
  151: I'm sorry. I really wanted this job. Can I have it please?
  152: Nothing.
  153: Grudda!
  154: Get out of here you damn Skag!
  155: Fine. I wish you would make up you mind, I'm a busy man...Let me give you the
    details.
  156: You're full of crap. Get the hell out.
  157: What are you talking to me for? I said to talk to Butch about the job. If he
    likes you, I'll fill you in on the details.
  158: What? Haven't you left yet?
  159: How goes the search?
  160: I can't seem to find anything.
  161: Could you please repeat the details on the job?
  162: Do you have any caravan jobs?
  163: Sorry, I've got to go.
  164: Rhoo?
  165: Well, I didn't say it was going to be easy. Otherwise, we would have solved
    the problem a long time ago. Ask around. Get rough if you have to, but don't draw
    blood. At least, not in public.
  166: I'm telling you, lay off the chems. They'll mess you up.
  167: |-
    The job pays 500 Hubbucks when you can tell Butch exactly what has been happening to all of the caravans that have
     disappeared recently. So, collect any proof you might find. I personally think it's those damn Water Merchants or those
     gun freaks at the Brotherhood of Steel. Butch thinks it's some Claw of death or something. Check with Beth, she would know more about that.
  168: Ok, but I don't know what you missed. There's not much to it.
  169: I thought for sure you were from there. I was just testing you. If you're not
    from there, how the hell did you get that suit of steel they all traipse around
    in?
  170: Oh, this? I 'found' it, if you know what I mean.
  171: I'm not at liberty to say.
  172: Damn, you must be good. I'm glad you're on our side. I don't know how you couldn't
    know, but the Brotherhood is a strange bunch that worship technology, or something
    like that.  They're just a little to the northwest from here.
  173: What's the Brotherhood of Steel?
  174: I can guarantee you it wasn't the Brotherhood.
  175: What do you know about the Deathclaw?
  176: Where's Beth?
  177: Thanks, bye.
  178: Well, whatever. I'm sure you've met them before. They're a strange bunch that
    worship technology or something like that. They're to the northwest of here.
  179: They are really strange. They worship technology or something like that. They
    have a hell of a lot of fire power. They could easily take out a caravan. They're
    to the northwest.
  180: I knew you had to be one of them. You had to be with that steel suit. I hope
    you're right, and I hope it's not a mistake hiring you, but you're not the only
    one we've hired so, it's ok.
  181: Why do you say that?
  182: Because I just joined their order, and I checked them out thoroughly. They're
    just real quiet and keep to themselves, but there is nothing to fear there.
  183: I've been inside that bunker of theirs. They aren't the ones you're looking
    for.
  184: Just a hunch.
  185: Well, that's reassuring. I think.
  186: I hope you're right.
  187: A hunch isn't good enough. We need proof.
  188: Beth's right out that door and to the right. She runs our weapon shop. Tell
    her you're working for us, and you'll get a 15% discount.
  189: Oh, yeah, Deathclaw, whatever. They're all crazy. It's just people's imagination
    getting carried away. There's no ghost or monster or whatever it's supposed to
    be. Just stick with reality, and you'll be fine.
  190: Yes? How can I help you?
  191: I know what's been happening to your caravans.
  192: Nothing.
  193: Wha.
  194: Grrr.
  195: Really? So, who are the bastards? The Water Merchants?
  196: Yea, that's them! They're out to get you. They...want your...brahmin.
  197: Actually, it was a group of these HUGE mutants.
  198: It was the Deathclaw. I saw it eat a whole caravan.
  199: I forgot.
  200: You forgot? Funny, man. Now, get lost.
  201: You forgot? Funny, lady. Now, get lost.
  202: I knew it was them. Did you bring proof? I'm going to make those bastards pay.
  203: Uhh. No. I lost it. But, you can take my word on it.
  204: Actually, it wasn't them. It was a bunch of huge mutants.
  205: Sorry, I've gotta go.
  206: Well, I can't do anything unless I have proof. I wouldn't want to start another
    merchant war. If you can bring me proof, I'll bring it to the law, and we'll wipe
    them out.
  207: You're full of crap. Get out of my face.
  208: What? How? That's impossible. You're gotta be joking? You are joking, aren't
    you?
  209: Yeah, sorry. Believe it or not, it was actually a huge bunch of mutants.
  210: It was terrible. It had these big, pointy teeth.
  211: A whole caravan? Really? What, do I look that gullible? Get out there and find
    out what's really happening to our caravans.
  212: Some huge mutants are destroying my caravans? That's almost as good as this
    Deathclaw story.
  213: I'm not joking. I found the Deathclaw and killed it, but I found this holodisk
    on the body of one of those...super mutant creatures.
  214: Well, check this holodisk out. I got it off one of the raiding mutants.
  215: It's true, I was there, and I saw it. I'll bring back proof.
  216: Fine, don't believe me.
  217: I've gotta go.
  218: Hey, I know how to use one of those. Butch got some gizmo from some scout from
    the Brotherhood a long time ago that can read these things. Let's see.……Sorry,
    I didn't believe you. This does not bode well for the good guys. Well, here's
    your 500 Hubbucks. Hell, make it 800, and thanks for the information!  If you
    need anymore work you will always be welcome.
  219: Please, don't add to Butch's paranoia. He's a little bit touchy when it comes
    to the Deathclaw. Now tell me, did you actually find anything out? Was it the
    Water Merchants?
  220: Yea, that's them! They're out to get you. They...want your...brahmin.
  221: Actually, it was a group of these HUGE mutants.
  222: No, it was really the Deathclaw. I saw it eat a whole caravan.
  223: I forgot.
  224: Rats, huh? So, did you find anything out or what? It's those damn Water Merchants,
    I know it!
  225: Yea, that's them! They're out to get you. They...want your...brahmin.
  226: Actually, it was a group of these HUGE mutants.
  227: It was the Deathclaw. I saw it eat a whole caravan.
  228: I forgot.
  229: Mutants destroyed our caravans? That's almost as good as the one about the
    Deathclaw.
  230: I'm not joking. I found the Deathclaw and killed it. But, I also found this
    holodisk on the body of those super mutant creatures.
  231: Well, check this holodisk out. I got it off one of the raiding mutants.
  232: It's the truth, I was there. I'll bring back proof.
  233: I've gotta go.
  234: So, do you have any proof about who's been messing with my, I mean, our caravans?
  235: Yea. Here's a holodisk I found on the body of one of those...huge mutant creatures.
  236: No, still looking. Any ideas?
  237: No, I'll let you know.
  238: Gak!
  239: Well, if this Deathclaw really does exist, you might want to examine it's lair.
    It might have a clue.
  240: Hi. How may I help you?
  241: I found out what happened to the missing caravans.
  242: Oh, nothing.
  243: Hey! I heard you killed the bastard in charge of those mutants. Good going.
    You probably saved the lives of everyone in the Hub; but I wonder where they were
    coming from.
  244: Yeah! More things to kill! I wonder where they're hiding.
  245: Yes, I must cleanse the area completely of the Master's evil work. I wonder
    where they are hiding.
  246: You're right! I wonder where they are hiding.
  247: I need some cash. Got any jobs?
  248: All in a day's work. See ya!
  249: Yeah, I kicked ass. Oops. I mean...Gruk Chak!
  250: Hey there, buddy. How are things going?
  252: Hey there, gorgeous. How are things going?
  253: How's my favorite lady?
  254: Fine, thanks. Do you have any more jobs?
  255: Great! Just stopping in to see how things are going.
  256: Yogwa?
  257: Things are great! There are no more raids from those damn mutants, and trade
    is back to where it was. Actually, trade is much better than it was. Thanks for
    asking.
  258: Hey, I heard you destroyed some base where all those damn mutants were hanging
    out! Good job! Too bad you couldn't track down their leader.
  259: Yeah! Something else to kill. I wonder where the Master is hiding.
  260: Yes, I must destroy the Master. I can't give evil a chance to spread any more.
    I wonder where the Master is hiding.
  261: The master is about to meet his maker.
  262: You're right! I wonder where the Master is hiding.
  263: I need some cash first. Got any jobs?
  264: Yea, I kicked ass. Oops. I mean...Gruk Chak!
  265: Well, I heard that some people saw some scattered groups of mutants way up
    to the northwest. Way passed the Brotherhood of Steel.
  266: You know, since the mutants were destroyed, the Children of the Cathedral have
    been acting 'very' strange. I actually overheard one talking about you. They seem
    to be looking for you desperately.
  267: Actually, things are not going so well. Those mutants are still causing problems
    with our Caravans. We've had to put almost all of our caravans on hold. Thanks
    for asking though.
  268: Sure, we could use you in one of our caravans.  Do you do guard work? The pay’s
    standard, 400 hubbucks. Interested?
  269: Sure
  270: Nope.
  271: What?  What about the missing caravans?
  272: What better way to find the thieves than to join a caravan?
  273: I’ll keep an eye out, but I need some scripts.
  274: Nevermind.
  275: Okay, but let me know if you change your mind.  Most of the time it’s easy
    money.
  276: Great, just talk to our caravan driver by the front door to see when the next
    caravan’s scheduled to leave.  Just as long as you do a good job our drivers will
    hire you.
  277: I’ll give you one more chance. The pay’s 400 hubbucks.  Go talk to the caravan
    driver by the front door to see when the next one goes out.
  278: I’m sorry, but I’ve given you a chance.  I think you should leave.
  279: You’ve got to be joking?  I may be very grateful for what you’ve done, but
    I’m afraid that doesn’t change the past.  I think you should leave.
  280: Didn’t you hear me?  We won’t hire you.  Please leave.
  281: I don’t think that will be very affective, but you can work on one if you like.
  282: Why do you say that?
  283: You’re right, let me snoop around some more.
  284: That’s okay, I’ll take the job.
  285: Great.  Be sure to ask around.
  286: Well, okay.  Just talk to our caravan driver by the front door when you’re
    ready to go.  Just as long as you do a good job our drivers will hire you.
  287: Of course!  You don’t need to talk to me. Just talk to our caravan driver.
  288: "[MORE]"
  289: Well sure, we may be losing a lot of caravans, but it is a very small percentage
    of our total business. The chances of you being on a caravan that is attacked
    by whatever is ‘completely’ capturing or destroying our caravans is very unlikely.  Who
    or what ever is doing this must have a pretty large force, or a very deadly one.
  290: 'Oh, okay.  I think I’ll ask around some more. '
  291: Well, I need the money.
  292: Hello again.  What can I do you for… I mean do for you?
  293: Nice to see you again.
  294: I was wondering, do you transport water?
  295: I’m here about the job that was posted.
  296: I’m looking for work.
  297: What is it that you do?
  298: Sorry, I’ve to got to go.
  299: Rarwa.
  300: Yea, what the heck do you want?
  301: I’m really getting sick of you.  What now?
  302: What!
  303: Are you always this annoying?
  304: What is it man?!?!
  305: I was wondering, do you transport water?
  306: I’m here about the job that was posted.
  307: I’m looking for work.
  308: What is it that you do?
  309: 'Sorry, I’ve to got to go. '
  310: Tooka?
  311: You pissed off the boss.  Get the hell out of here!
  312: I think I may have figured out what's been happening to the missing caravans.
  313: That's great!  Go tell Butch what you've found and he'll let me know if you've
    earned your reward.
  314: Grdddle Snpp!!!
  315: I'm sorry but we don't deal with... um... the intellectually challenged.
SMITTY:
  100: You see Smitty.
  101: You see a large, muscular man.
  102: Good day. What can I do for you?
  103: What do you want?
  104: May I ask your name?
  105: I need you to fix these parts for me, so that I can fix your hydroponic farms.
  106: I'd like to buy something.
  107: Can I ask you a few questions?
  108: Nothing, thanks. See you around.
  109: Uhhh . . .
  110: |-
    I'd recommend that you check out Tine's store, just to one side of the gates. I
    don't actually sell anything here; I trade it to Tine or the Hub merchants for goods.
  111: |-
    Why, everyone just calls me 'Smitty'.
     Probably because I'm the local blacksmith.
  112: Ask away.
  113: Where did you get all of your shop equipment?
  114: What all do you make here?
  115: Can you make guns and bullets?
  116: Nothing else, thanks.
  117: I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you. Try Zimmerman.
  118: Sure.
  119: |-
    Why, any competent blacksmith can make his own anvil!
     'course, I really just sort of learned the craft by practice,
     but I made most of my own tools.
  120: |-
    Mostly I make and repair tools and implements here.
     I also fix things for the Hub merchants. With the help of Miles,
     the chemist, I reload bullets from time to time.
  121: |-
    Well, building guns and making shells takes machining, and I just don't have
     the tools for that. But with the help of Miles, the chemist, I can reload old brass,
     since I can cast bullets.
  122: Yes, I can fix this. Give me some time.
  123: Here you are. [Smitty hands you the fixed parts.]
  124: I already fixed the parts. You need to give them to Miles now.
  125: |-
    Thanks for fixin' the farms. If you ever find yourself a plasma rifle, bring
     it on back here. I know a few tricks that I can pull with the injectors.
  126: Well, I have one right here.
  127: So you found yourself a plasma rifle!
  128: |-
    Hand it over and I'll take a look at it. [Smitty takes a plasma rifle
     from you, pulls out his tools, and starts to tinker with it.]
  129: |-
    There, I think that does it. [Smitty hands you back your plasma rifle.]
     Try that out for size.
  130: |-
    Like I said before, if you get yourself a plasma rifle
     and bring it back here, I can tweak it some for you.
  131: Good seein' you again. Hope you're doing all right.
LARS:
  100: You see a heavily muscled, scarred man with a mustache.
  101: You see Lars, the sergeant of the Junktown guards.
  102: He bears the scars of previous wounds, and looks like an old hand.
  103: |-
    He has scars from knife and bullet injuries. His corded muscles show
     a man hardened by adversity.
  104: |-
    You know, it's not wise to try to steal from the guards here in Junktown,
     punk!
  105: Can I help you, stranger?
  106: So, what's there to do around here?
  107: Can you give me the big picture on Junktown?
  108: Who're you?
  109: Eergh.
  110: |-
    If you're in charge of the guards here, I think I have some information
     for you.
  111: Hey! You! We know about you, you monster!
  112: |-
    Plenty, so long as you stay on our good side. We got Killian Darkwaters'
     store, where you can do some trading. And there's Gizmo's Casino, if you're a
     gambler. Or if you just want a drink, you can head on over to the Skum Pitt.
     Just don't get too rowdy.
  113: Hey, I like a rowdy time!
  114: |-
    Well, you'd best keep yourself under control. We're a free town but we
     don't tolerate stepping on other people's toes. Don't cause any problems and
     you won't give cause for me and my men to come down on you.
  115: What a stick in the mud!
  116: |-
    Look, buddy, my job here is to keep the peace, and if I have to break a
     few heads to do it, then a few people are going to be hurting. So just watch it.
  117: |-
    Me and my men here work for Killian Darkwater. We keep some order in this
     town, dealing with all of the murderers, thieves, and other scumbags who come in
     from the desert. If you want my advice, you'll also stay away from Gizmo. That
     fathead runs a crooked operation, but we just haven't been able to prove anything.
     He and his lackeys, the Skulz, are going to take the fall sometime soon, if
     Killian has anything to say about it.
  118: What a bummer. No fun here at all.
  119: Good to know that someone's keeping the peace around here. Thanks.
  120: So, what keeps you lawboys from just busting Gizmo and the Skulz?
  121: |-
    Hey, it's our job. But it's good to know that someone appreciates it.
     Thanks.
  122: |-
    Got to do it all proper like. We know that Gizmo runs a rigged operation
     and all, but we need hard evidence to bring him down. Same with the Skulz; they
     rough someone up, we bring one or two of 'em in, but nothing changes. We just
     don't have any direct evidence tying them to any of the killings or muggings.
  123: Maybe I can help you with that.
  124: Well, good luck.
  125: |-
    Hell, if you think you can get some dirt on either of them, we'd appreciate
     the help. Killian's the one to talk to if you want to talk about Gizmo. But if you
     can get some info on the Skulz, just come back to me and me and the boys will
     take care of them.
  126: Thanks. Watch your back.
  127: |-
    I'm the head of the guards here in Junktown. Name's Lars. For that matter,
     who are you, stranger?
  128: 'I''m '
  129: "."
  130: Buzz off, I don't have to tell you anything.
  131: 'Welcome to Junktown, '
  132: ". What can I help you with?"
  133: Can you fill me in on Junktown?
  134: Just lookin' for something to do. Got any suggestions?
  135: Good day, traveler. Do you need something?
  136: What?
  137: I'm looking for a little work.
  138: Just stopping by to say hello.
  139: |-
    I have testimony about the illegal activities that the Skulz
     were involved in.
  140: Yes, I'm in charge of the guards here. What do you have for me?
  141: Nothing, just checking.
  142: |-
    I have some testimony from Sherry that the Skulz are involved in some
     illegal activities.
  143: So, you have some info on the Skulz, eh? What can you tell me?
  144: They're involved in some muggings and killings here.
  145: |-
    I've convinced one of them, Sherry, to testify that they were involved
     in criminal activity.
  146: |-
    That's great and all, but I can't just jail them all on one person's
     say-so. I need hard evidence or inside testimony.
  147: I'll see what I can do.
  148: I've got testimony from Sherry, a former gang member.
  149: |-
    Excellent. I'll pick her up for a few questions, and I'm sure that I'll
     get all the information that I need to put them away.
  150: |-
    Look, this isn't a game. People are getting hurt here. If you find some
     real evidence, come back, but otherwise, don't waste my time!
  151: |-
    If you're not averse to a little skullduggery, I need someone to get some
     hard evidence on the Skulz, proving that they're involved in illegal
     activities here. Or you can talk to Killian; he might have some work for you.
  152: |-
    Thanks for your assistance. Junktown's a little safer now, because of
     your help.
  153: Move along there, fella.
  154: You gain 300 experience points for taking a risky turn against the Skulz.
  155: You ready to help take down Gizmo?
  156: You bet. Let's nail that tub.
  157: No, I changed my mind.
  158: All right, let's do it.
  159: Well, you'd best wait here so you don't get caught in the crossfire.
  160: Killian sent me to help run Gizmo out of town.
  161: Killian sent me. We're going to take Gizmo down.
  162: |-
    Thanks for all your help. Here's 500 caps. You're always welcome in
     Junktown, friend.
  163: |-
    What? Hmm. We'll see about that. I'll send some men over to ambush them
     when they try it. You gonna be there?
  164: No thanks, I've done my good deed for the day.
  165: Yes.
  166: The Skulz are planning on killing Neal!
  167: Lars's men quickly eliminate the Skulz.
  168: Looks like Lars might still be alive, but he's definitely out of the fight.
  169: |-
    Wanderer, you just screwed up. We needed evidence so that we could take
     down Gizmo all nice and legal-like. Look, off the record, I'm happy to have that
     fat fuck out of the picture, but we can't condone murder. You better leave
     Junktown and never come back.
  170: |-
    We don't like your kind here. You've got about fifteen seconds before I
     blow your head off.
  171: Hello again! What can I do for you?
  172: Uh-huh.
  173: Nuh-uh.
  174: |-
    You gain 500 experience points for assisting in the elimination of the
     Skulz gang.
  1000: Gizmo
  1100: He runs the casino. He's a crook.
TRAPFLOR:
  100: " senses that there is a trap near."
  101: You sense that there is a trap near.
  102: " sets off a trap, alerting the base to your presence."
  103: You set off a trap, alerting the base to your presence.
MUTFRUIT:
  100: You eat the fruit.
DOG2:
  100: Come here, boy.
  101: Ruff. Ruff.
  102: For some reason, this dog likes you.
FRYSTUB:
  100: You see Deputy Fry.
  101: The sheriff is in charge of this operation.  Talk to him instead.
HHOOKER:
  106: You see a woman.
  107: You see a man.
  100: You see a drunk.
  110: Leave me to my sorrows.
  111: Yer my bestest friend.
  112: Why you're... (hic) where am I?
  113: Who are you?
  114: Do I know you?
  115: I feel a little queasy.
  116: Drinks are on me, I mean you.
  117: Why are there two of you?
  118: Stand still laddy!
  119: Stand still girl!
  101: You see a customer.
  104: You see a gambler.
  120: Beat it skag!
  121: Yer droppin' the class of this joint.
  122: Get away, you'll jinx me!
  123: Don't break my concentration.
  124: I'll beat this damn game yet!
  125: You any good at this?
  126: Did you see that? That was impossible!
  127: I think they're cheating.
  128: Now those are good odds.
  129: It's a sure thing.
  130: What? How could I have lost?
  131: This table's jinxed!
  132: I'm busy.
  133: Can't you see I'm playing a game here?
  134: Bet it or beat it.
  102: You see a very pretty lady.
  105: You see a woman, see seems to be busy.
  135: Leave us alone or I'll call the guards.
  136: Watch it, I'm a close friend of Deputy Fry.
  137: Do you mind?
  138: No peep shows!
  139: I don't do groups.
  140: I'm too tired for another one.
  141: You're dreaming pal, beat it!
  142: Get the hell out!
  143: What the hell do you think you're doing?
  144: Mind your manners!
  145: I'll call the cops!
  146: Don't even think about it!
  147: Get out!
  148: Beat it!
  149: What are you staring at?
  150: Do you mind?
  109: You see a mercenary.
  151: Get the hell out of our room!
  152: Get out!
  153: Are you part of the combo?
  154: Beat it pervert!
  155: What's your problem?
  156: Beat it before I get angry.
  157: Get your own.
  158: She's mine.
  108: You see a very upset gambler.
  159: Damn!
  160: Are you cheating?
  161: That should have been mine.
  162: Almost!
  163: Just missed it.
  164: What're the rules again?
  165: I used to be good at this.
  166: Thanks for nothing.
  167: I don't believe it!
  168: I meant to do that.
  103: You see a strange looking man.
  169: Place your bets.
  170: Keep your hands away sir.
  171: Winner!
  172: Sorry folks, maybe next time.
  173: Another winner!
  174: Hands off!
  175: Your turn sir.
  176: Sorry, that's an invalid bet.
  177: That's it.
  178: Anyone else?
JUSTIN:
  100: You see Sheriff Justin Greene.
  101: |-
    Awe, it's the slayer of the innocents. I've heard of you, and you're lucky I have a badge stopping me
     from blowing you away on the spot. I suggest you leave our town--Right now. And stay away from our children.
  102: |-
    Hello sir! The name's Justin Greene. I'm the sheriff of this fine city. Is there something I can
     do for you this fine day?
  103: |-
    Hello ma'am! The name's Justin Greene. I'm the sheriff of this fine city. Is there something I can
     do for you this fine day?
  104: Well, spit it out!
  105: Decker tried to hire me to kill some merchant and his wife.
  106: Decker tried to hire me to kill someone named Jain.
  107: Nothing, sorry.
  108: Sorry, I can't tell you. I'd be dead.
  109: |-
    Well, thank you. We try our best. It's really tough in a city this size, but we do the best we can with
     what we've got. It's hard when the thugs have better firepower than you do.
  110: Thanks again.
  111: It's time for you to leave, child killer.
  112: |-
    We couldn't have that. But, if you ever change your mind, please let me know. It's a dangerous
     place out there and someone has to stand up for what's right.
  113: |-
    Excellent! I had already heard from other sources about his plan. You're the final confirmation I needed
     to take action against him. This is going to be rough, and I can use any help I can get. I can pay you 1300
     scripts. 300 now, and the rest when we're all done. What do you say?
  114: |-
    You're too late...Damn! I knew he was responsible, I only wish I knew in time to stop him. In any case,
     you're the final witness I needed to act. We'll have to "take him out." This is going to be rough, and I can
     use any help I can get. I can pay you 1300 scripts. 300 now, and the rest when we're all done. What do you say?
  115: |-
    You're too late...How do I know you're not responsible? Decker's not likely to let someone know about his
     plans and live.
  116: |-
    I just got word that she's already dead...wait a minute. How do I know that you're not the one responsible?
     Decker's not likely to let someone know about his plans and live.
  117: It'll be a pleasure.
  118: Sorry, I want it all up front.
  119: No way! You're on your own.
  120: |-
    No way. You seem trustworthy, but I can't be sure that you won't leave us when it gets hot. This way,
     one of us has to survive to be sure you get paid. This way, it might add a 'little' bit of insurance.
  121: Let's do it.
  122: You're on your own, Sheriff.
  123: Great! Here's the first part of your payment.  [The Sheriff hands you 300 caps]
  124: I'm ready.
  125: Okay, Bye.
  126: I'm really sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, let me know, but I
    can't wait very long.
  127: Okay, I'll do it. Just wait for me to get some supplies.
  128: You're mad.
  129: Bye.
  130: Great!  Here's the first part of your payment.  [The Sheriff gives you 300
    caps]
  131: |-
    What? Do you expect me to stand around and let him kill innocent people? I've a responsibility to this
     city, which I don't expect you to understand.
  132: You're right. Now's it's your turn.
  133: How dare you accuse me!
  134: I don't care what you think.
  135: Well, he didn't try anything.
  136: We were in the Falcon, and there were a lot of people around.
  137: |-
    I'm sorry. Decker's been playing us all against each other for years. I don't know who to trust any more.
     I really could use your help, though. It'll be rough, but I'll pay you 1300 scripts. 300 now and 1000 when
     we're done.
  138: I know a rat when I smell one! You're lucky I don't have any proof, and I suggest
    you leave town before I find some.
  139: |-
    That's very strange. I've never heard of Decker coming out of his office. He must be getting braver. That
     damn, murdering...argh! I'll get him yet! I'll tell you what, you help us out, and I'll pay you 1300 scripts--
     300 now and 1000 when we're all done. What do you say?
  140: |-
    That's the biggest pile of Brahmin shit I've ever heard. Decker never leaves his office. I knew there was
     something not right about you. You're lucky I don't have any proof, and I suggest you leave town before I find
     some!
  141: Okay, let's go...
  142: So, you came to turn yourself in? I'm impressed.
  143: Yes, I'm sorry.
  144: Turn myself in? Don't make me laugh.
  145: Get him!
  146: Get her!
  147: Alright, into your cell you go.
  148: Just sit tight. You're not going anywhere for a while.
  149: Fugitive! Get him!
  150: Fugitive! Get her!
  151: Ready to go take out Decker?
  152: Yes.
  153: No.
  154: Ug.
  155: I can't believe Decker's finally dead. I never thought I'd see the day.
  156: Have you changed your mind? We could still use you to get rid of that disease
    we talked about.
  157: I'll go.
  158: No, sorry.
  159: Fah?
  160: We're watching you.
  161: I have a crime to report!
  162: You're doing a fine job.
  163: Just stopping by. See ya.
  164: Oula.
  165: Hello again, sir. What can I do for you today?
  166: Hello again, ma'am. What can I do for you today?
  167: Hello. How can I help you?
  168: Yes?
  169: Just sleep if off, okay?
  170: You're kidding!  Well... uh... did... did he ask you personally?
  171: Yes, he did.
  172: |-
    Man, that was one hell of a battle!  You did well in there.  Now that Decker and Kane are gone the rest of the
     Underground will fall very shortly.  Without leadership, organizations like that can't last.  Nobody around here is smart
     enough to take up the reigns.
  173: |-
    Well, here's the rest of your reward.  Thanks again for your help.  This city owes you a debt of gratitidue.
      [The Sheriff hands you 1000 caps]
  174: We can leave as soon as you're ready.
  175: Let me know when you're ready. We'll wait for you, but don't take too long.
MVRCRDOR:
  100: |-
    You see a steel door. A sign on it reads: "Reactor Core Control Room.
     Authorized Personnel Only."
  101: The door is locked electronically.
  102: The door is not locked.
  103: You manage to bypass the electronic lock.
  104: Your attempt to circumvent the electronic lock fails.
SETGUARD:
  100: The guard does not respond to you.
PEASANTD:
  100: You see a peasant.
  101: |-
    Oh, yah, big man running from a scary dog. Phil,
     you sure showed it. Yep, you sure did.
  102: |-
    What you doing, Phil? You're checking the tread on those
     sneakers, aren't you?
  103: |-
    Man, that dog looks hungry. It sure wants to eat you alive,
     Phil.
  104: |-
    That might be a little overkill for a poor
     defenseless animal, doncha think?
  105: That sure is a nice pooch you have there.
  106: |-
    I'm sure Phil would appreciate it if you were
     to get rid of his dog.
  107: Thanks for dealing with that dog.
GENPALA:
  100: Die, you dog!
  101: My defeat shall be avenged!
  102: Hail, Initiate! I hope your patrols have fared well.
  103: Hold! If you have not spoken with our Captain yet, do so and then go!
  104: |-
    Hold! I recognize you and I do not trust you. I give you fair warning:
     if you make trouble for us, you will be shot dead. Now move!
RAIDGRD:
  100: The Raider is too frightened of Garl to speak to you any more.
  101: You see a tough desert Raider.
  102: It's the Death-Hand. He's returned!
  103: Excuse me, Death-Hand. I'm sorry to disturb you.
  104: Have you come back to kill your son?
  105: Aiyeee! A ghost!
  106: The dead walk again! The Death-Hand has returned!
  107: Well met.
  108: Hi.
  109: I'm waiting for Garl to crush Shady Sands. I want some loot.
  110: Welcome friend.
  111: I'm glad that you could return for a visit.
  112: Unless you want trouble, you'd better put that away.
  113: Do you want to party?
  114: Oh, a tough one, huh?
  115: Garl Death-Hand loves his warriors. Put that thing away and go talk to him.
  116: So, you think you're tough, huh? Mess with me and we'll both find out.
  117: I don't like your looks.
  118: Go away!
  119: What do you want?
  120: I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Seen her?
  121: Nothing. Just looking around.
  122: Huh??
  123: Oh. You must be looking for a job. Go and see Garl in the big room and leave
    us alone.
  124: Then do it elsewhere.
  125: Nah. I ain't seen her. Why are you asking?
  126: Nothing. Just looking for a friend of mine.
  127: There is a bounty on her head. If I can kill her, I can get some good cash.
  128: You're lying. Where is she?
  129: Ah, ok.
  130: Really? What does she look like?
  131: About 6 feet tall. Blonde. She's from Shady Sands.
  132: |-
    Yeah, she's here. She's in the big house. You know, if we tell Garl,
     then he would want a piece of the bounty. You might want to think about that.
  133: |-
    You don't sound like you mean it. I think that you are up to something.
     And if you are telling the truth, then I'll bag the reward for myself.
  134: I . . . I can't say any more, or Garl will kill me.
  135: Bite me!
  136: I don't like your looks. You'd better get away from me.
  137: What? Go away!
GHREFUGE:
  100: You see a ghoul refugee.
  101: Please don't kill me.
  102: Shut up and I might let you live.
  103: Don't worry, you aren't worth it.
  104: What happened here?
  105: Gah.
  106: You . . . You're just gonna kill me, anyway!
  107: Ah, oh. OK.
  108: Good, stay that way.
  109: Now, tell me what happened here.
  110: You're gonna kill me!
  111: Ah, didn't you just tell me to shut up?
  112: You die now.
  113: Yes, and now I want to know what happened here.
  114: |-
    The super mutants attacked. We were slaughtered. They had guns
     and bombs, even some steam trucks. They killed my friends. The
     mutants just butchered us, like you're probably gonna do to me.
  115: |-

     mutants just butchered us.
  116: What's a steam truck?
  117: How did you survive?
  118: Do you know why?
  119: I don't know.
  120: Thanks.
  121: You're useless.
  122: I heard they was pissed that some human killed their men here.
  123: Oh, uh, anything else?
  124: Hmmm. OK. Get out of here.
  125: No.
  126: Thanks.
  127: You're useless.
  128: |-
    I heard some of the sewer ghouls might have survived, but
     I don't like it down there.
  129: OK, thanks.
  130: That's it?
  131: Yeah, that's it.
  132: OK, Thanks.
  133: I hid until most of the mutants left.
  134: Anything else?
  135: Some big thing that moved on wheels but without any brahmin.
  136: Hmm, OK. Anything else?
  137: That's dumb.
  138: Hey, then why did you ask about it?
  139: That's it! Enough insolence from you!
  140: Just wanted to know. That's all.
  141: You again? What do you want now?
  142: Any more news?
  143: Just making chit-chat.
  144: |-
    Nope. Well, I did hear that more super mutants were coming.
     I don't know when.
  145: Hmm. OK.
  146: Make it elsewhere then. I gotta keep low.
JAIN:
  100: You see Jain
  101: Why do you disturb an elder of the Cathedral?
  102: I have come seeking a blessing.
  103: I'm interested in your church, and I want some information. Do you have any
    pamphlets?
  104: Just looking around.
  105: Mom?
  106: I am hardly your mother.
  107: Nuh-uh?
  108: Poopie!
  109: How dare you speak to me in that manner! You will be punished for your insolence!
    Guards!
  110: Perhaps one of our priests will discuss your needed education. Leave now.
  111: Have you studied the sacraments, child?
  112: Yes.
  113: No.
  114: Then you would have known high elders of the Cathedral do not just 'hand out'
    blessings. You will leave now.
  115: Continue to mock me and I will have you thrown out.
  116: But I'm not mocking you, honest.
  117: Mock you? Now why would I do something like that?!
  118: It's obvious that kindness and good temper aren't part of this religion.
  119: Sorry, I think I'll be leaving now.
  120: You will pay for those heretical words.
  121: Your words do not match your conviction. They burn of the heresy within. You
    will be cleansed, then forgotten.
  122: Then why are you here? What would bring you to the Children of the Cathedral?
  123: I am a seeker of knowledge. I would like to learn more.
  124: I need to know how to burn this place down, so I was looking for structural
    weaknesses.
  125: I'm just looking.
  126: Are you a Child?
  127: Lady, do I look that young to you?
  128: Am I one of the Children of the Cathedral? No.
  129: I am a devout believer.
  130: Then you should know better then to be here. I would caution you about your
    manners. Leave.
  131: OK.
  132: Bite me.
  133: Are you interested in converting to our faith? We can offer you what no one
    else can...
  134: And what's that?
  135: No, not interested. I think you're a bunch of kooks.
  136: A lifetime of contentment. Fulfillment in the knowledge you're working to rebuild
    the planet and make a better place for those that follow.
  137: Sounds very interesting, could you tell me more? I seek fulfillment.
  138: Oh yeah, I bet there's a lot of rebuilding going on and I'm sure your cups
    are overflowing with fulfillment.
  139: I don't think so. Sounds a little fishy to me.
  140: Believe what you will. Just do it elsewhere. You may leave.
  141: Mocking our holy cause is not appreciated. You will be punished if you continue.
  142: And who's going to do the punishing? Ooh, I'd like to request the extra hard
    whip, if you don't mind.
  143: Sorry.
  144: When the Children walk the reborn land, your kind will vanish, heretic. Leave
    now.
  145: I am not completely devoid of humor, but leading the Children is something
    I take seriously. Please remember that.
  146: Sorry, I'm not that familiar with the Children.
  147: OK. Bye.
  148: You are in the right place for spiritual fulfillment. The Children of the Cathedral
    seek a peaceful resolution of our world's problems and could use your help.
  149: What are the Children's plans for mutants?
  150: How can Children find peace in this wasteland?
  151: Those that can be brought into the fold, shall be. Those that resist will suffer.
  152: Sounds like a tough job.
  153: Now it's time for you to have a little suffering.
  154: As it should be. May you succeed in your crusade!
  155: Uh, I got to go.
  156: With perseverance, the Children can accomplish anything. We will not fail.
  157: Good. I hope you don't.
  158: Yeah, right. Whatever.
  159: Okay. Bye.
  160: Blasphemer! This is a Holy House! How could you think such a thing?
  161: Relax, I didn't mean it!
  162: Easy. Let me show you.
  163: Blessings of the Holy Flame to you, my Child.
  164: Who's the Holy Flame?
  165: This place is a sham.
  166: And to you, Priestess Jain. Goodbye.
  167: Ug luk to ruk?
  168: Ooook!
  169: Once you had potential. You are no longer welcome here.
  170: You are not welcome here. Please leave.
  171: What brings you here?
  172: I have slain the Master, and I believe he was masquerading as the Holy Flame.
  173: You have been freed from the oppression of the Master.
  174: Mu tuk doh tub?
  175: Feeties.
  176: You have done what? You shall pay for your sin against the Holy Flame himself.
  177: The who?
  178: The master. He was going to unite the mutants and take over the world.
  179: Don't worry about it.
  180: You appear delusional. I suggest seeing a counselor to work out your problems.
  181: I told you to leave. Are you deaf or feeble?
  182: Leave this room immediately or I will have you cleansed by holy flame.
  183: There is no one greater then the Holy Flame and we are His servants.
  184: Really? Wow. So, what's the reason for someone to join your order?
  185: Uh, okay. Bye.
  186: Blessings of the Holy Flame to you, my Child.
  187: With perseverance, the Children can accomplish anything. We will not fail.
  188: That is not an appropriate question.

  1100: It was the cleansing of the planet.  The inattention by those who came before
    caused the holy fires.  It was justice.
  1101: There is no Master but the Holy Flame.  He is our master, He is the Master
    of all.
  1102: The will of the Holy One brings a rebirth to the planet.  We are His Children
    and carry out His plan.
  1103: They are holy for they bear marks of past sins for present witnesses.
  1104: Like many other cities, they will embrace the moral leadership of the Cathedral.
  1105: They claim a religious foundation, but lack that which would make them truly
    righteous.  Their zeal is refreshing, however.
  1106: I have never heard of such things.
  1107: The Holiest of Holies.  He is the guiding light we follow.  He shall cleanse
    those unfaithful when the Nexus of Rebirth is reached.
  1108: It is the uniting, by the Holy Flame, of all people, of all races and the
    cleansing of the heathens from this world.
  1109: They claim a religious foundation, but lack that which would make them truly
    righteous.  Their zeal is refreshing, however.
  1110: The Holiest of Holies.  He is the guiding light we follow.  He shall cleanse
    those unfaithful when the Nexus of Rebirth is reached.

    and carry out His plan.

    Why would I want to talk with someone who goes around killing kids?
     Get out of my face!

  110: Peace, brother! I'm just checking the place out.
  111: |-
    I'm not interested in impressing you. You got something intelligent to
     say, say it!
  112: Get it on? Mister, I don't go for scrawny little boys.
  113: What do you want?
  114: You talk too much.
  115: You wanna die, and I wanna kill someone. Works for me.
  116: Waa!
  117: Man, I already talked to you! Take your shit somewhere else!
  118: boy

    I was looking for someone smart enough to tell me what's really going
     on around this joint!
  124: What will the priests say if they hear you talking like this?
  125: Any time, pal. I've been waiting for a good scrap!
  126: Hey, what's the problem? A few drinks and we'll be buds!
  127: |-
    Did you know that even a child can apply enough pressure to the right
     spot in your kneecap to cripple you for life? Just thought you'd want to know.
  128: |-
    You wanna talk to Ton? Fine. But if I hear the word "praise,"
     I'll kill you.
  129: You're not a big fan of worship services?
  130: What's your problem, pal?
  131: I want to speak with the man in charge.
  132: Sure thing. The only thing I feel like praising is a bottle of Rad Scorpion.
  133: Fine. The first one of us who says that word dies. Bargain?
  134: |-
    Hello, miss. I am Ton, 2,000 pounds of the Master's toughest fighter.
     I have also been evolved by the FEV into something that you need to check
     out. Let's get it on, baby.
  135: No way in hell.
  136: That's a little too fast. Let's get to know each other first.
  137: |-
    Hello. I've been evolved by the FEV so that anyone that annoys
     me dies. Stop annoying me, little man.
  138: Check it out somewhere else. Ton don't like your company.
  139: |-
    Fine. You want to play it straight? Sometimes killing's necessary.
     Sometimes I even like it. But I hear you love killing . . . all the time.
     Every time I've met a psycho, either he dies, or Ton dies. Ton is
     still here. So why don't you go elsewhere.
  140: |-
    Man, I could learn to like you. You're either an incredible asshole,
     or you got guts. Either way is fine with Ton, as long as you don't
     jam me up. You want to join up?
  141: Whatever happened to peace and love?
  142: What's involved?
  143: No way in hell, pal.
  144: I'll jam whatever I want, wherever I want. So let's kick out the jams!
  145: To see you suffer. Let's go, hombre, give me what I want.
  146: Beware of what you want. You may not like what you get.
  147: I'd rather be your friend.
  148: You aren't worth my time.
  149: Go ahead. Make the first move. The last one's mine.
  150: Fine. Talking's over. Make your move.
  151: I just wanted to talk.
  152: You're dead . . .
  153: Shit! You're dumber than the zombies! Just get out of here!
  154: |-
    The Master wants peace, and he wants us to get it for him, so we're
     going to have fun. Capiche?
  155: Yeah, but there's got to be more going on than just that.
  156: Does the Master really want peace or does he just want killing?
  157: Who is this Master?
  158: Sounds good to me.
  159: Screw the Master! Let's kill them all!
  160: |-
    It's not healthy to ask the wrong question, compadre. They have all
     the answers they want you to hear. People who ask the wrong questions, or
     people who screw up, well, they don't stay around here very long.
  161: |-
    I do my job. They like it when I do my job. They like it when street
     trash and Followers stop breathing. It lets the Nightkin do other things.
     Don't mess with me . . . it ain't healthy.
  162: |-
    What are you doing dressed like a zombie? If you got the 'tude, you
     gotta let it show!
  163: |-
    I don't care about the clothes, man. I just want to know what's going
     on here!
  164: |-
    They don't bother you as much if you don't look like they might want
     to convert you.
  165: None of your business, pal.
  166: I've been thinking of converting.
  167: It ain't 'tude. It's a way of death.
  168: |-
    We don't drink in here. Nightkin don't like it. You better get a few
     more clues before you talk to Ton again.
  169: |-
    You're crazy! I could almost like you, except that I have the feeling
     that people who hang around you don't live long. Get the hell out of here.
  170: |-
    You stand around this for months and you go crazy as them. What do
     you want from Ton?
  171: How'd these people get like this?
  172: I want sex and violence, without the sex. You know where I can get it?
  173: |-
    I am losing it in this zombie pit, and I don't need you helping me.
     Get the hell away from me.
  174: |-
    That's Morpheus. He stays upstairs, except to give sermons. He don't
     even do that much anymore. He's smart and he's a winner, and that's all
     that counts. Go see him for yourself.
  175: |-
    You need to go out into the Boneyard, pal. Ain't no slosh in here,
     and I've looked!
  176: Agree. What can Ton do for you?
  177: Bitch! You don't know what you're missing! Get out!
  178: Life is too short for that. Let me show you why you don't want to wait.
  179: But I want someone who knows what's going on.
  180: No thank you. But I wouldn't mind being friends.
  181: Get lost, you piece of trash.
  182: Sure.
  183: Life IS shorter than you think. Die, asshole!
  184: I'm not LITTLE, bitch!
  185: |-
    Who believes in that bullshit? They have to program these morons to
     believe in that stuff anyway.
  186: How did it happen?
  187: Really?
  188: What a bunch of losers.
  189: Tell me more about your posse.
  190: Okay, I'll join up.
  191: Someone should put them out of their misery. Like me . . .
  192: |-
    When we get the word, we go out and kill people. People like the
     Followers or some of the more dangerous gang types.
  193: So the Followers are a problem?
  194: This sounds pretty sick to me.
  195: Who needs the word? Why not just kill them?
  196: |-
    Fine. Do what you want. But I'd get out before it becomes unhealthy
     around here.
  197: |-
    You annoying little piece of shit. You're worse than a Junktowner,
     you coward. Get the hell out.
  198: |-
    What else is there to know? I get to eat well, sleep in peace
     and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more
     from life?
  199: |-
    Who knows? Who cares? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and
     kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more
     from life?
  200: |-
    Hmmm, Ton never thought of that. But if they bother me too much,
     I break their face. Then they stop bothering Ton. What do you want?
  201: Converting? Well, good luck. You'll need it.
  202: Why would I need luck?
  203: That doesn't sound good.
  204: Thanks. You're a true friend.
  205: I don't need luck as long as I've got ammo.
  206: |-
    These people, these zombies, weren't always like this. I could even
     stand a few of them. Then they got converted. Some of them came out like this.
     Some of them didn't come out at all. Ton doesn't like it, but these
     people pay Ton well.
  207: Why do you keep jumping between first and third person?
  208: Tell me more about the conversion process.
  209: Did you go through the conversion process?
  210: This place is strictly low-rent.
  211: Really, how much?
  212: Nobody's gonna do this to me!
  213: |-
    You talk to Morpheus or to Lasher, or you can bother Ton, and
     Ton give you more violence than you can handle.
  214: |-
    Well baby, what's going on is that there are a lot of zombies chanting,
     a lot of people dying and the Children are going to take over everything.
     And there's you and me and nothing else matters!
  215: But Barracas, darling, surely there's more going on than that . . .
  216: Oh, Ton!
  217: Forget it, creep. You ain't my type.
  218: Nothing else matters? Hell no! I wanna hear about the dying part!
  219: |-
    Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what
     Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when
     I think about some place more convenient . . .
  220: |-
    You'll find out soon enough what happens upstairs. If you tough, you
     get through it fine. It happened to Ton, and Ton is just fine!
  221: |-
    Uh . . . I didn't say anything. You forget what Ton told you
     or Ton will make you forget, permanently!
  222: |-
    They used to be whiners. But Ton talks too much. You get out
     of my face.
  223: Fine. You stay low-profile until I give you the word. Then we have fun.
  224: |-
    They're cowards. They set ambushes against our patrols. They send spies
     and saboteurs. They know they can't win a real fight. The Master says we
     should feel sorry for them, but Ton just want to kill them. Smart man,
     Ton.
  225: |-
    We need discipline, fool! We're soldiers now! We obey orders. Killers
     die, but soldiers win their battles. We're going to beat the Followers.
     We're going to beat EVERYONE!
  226: |-
    Who the hell knows? Maybe it's just Morpheus pulling the strings.
     Things are good, and if this dries up, Ton goes somewhere else.
  227: |-
    Well, don't get too eager. Even with the Nightkin, it's still tough
     fighting. But if we play it smart, we get out ahead. That's the only thing
     Ton cares about.
  228: |-
    The conversion isn't easy. You see these people, all these zombies?
     They used to be like you and me. Ton survived. These people didn't.
     But why should Ton care about you?
  229: You don't like the way Ton talk? Then Ton kill you!
  230: |-
    Ton go through it fine. I . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . .
     Ton . . . Ton just fine.
  231: |-
    I used to be with the Dead Dog gang. Always hungry, always tired.
     This place is much better for Ton. Why should I worry about anyone else?
     Nobody ever worry about me.
  232: You greedy asshole! Get outta here before Ton kills you!
  233: Then get out of here now, before it's too late.
  234: |-
    Nothing important as you and me. Unfortunately, this is the worst place
     on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style.
     I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .
  235: Why you manipulative bitch! Nobody screws with Ton like that!
JNKSCOUT:
  100: You see a traveller.
  101: What do you want, stranger?
  102: Who are you?

  106: Uhh . . .

  110: You see a guard from Junktown.
TOGGLE:
  100: |-

  107: Wha?
  108: I go.
  109: Make it quick.  I'm not supposed to be talking on the job.
  110: Where am I?
  111: What's your job?
  112: Sorry to bother you.  Bye.
  113: You'd better watch your step and your mouth, punk!
  114: NO!  You'd better watch it!  I'm gonna' put a bullet in your head!
  115: You're not worth my time.
  116: |-
    If you don't know, you probably shouldn't be here.  This is the Heights.  Mister Hightower lives here
     and he only sees people on appointment.
  117: What's your job?
  118: Can I set up an appointement with Mr. Hightower?
  119: Thanks for your time.
  120: I'm here to make sure nobody messes with Mr. Hightower.
  121: Well, I'm actually interested in killing Mr. Hightower.  It's time to earn
    your pay!
  122: Where am I?
  123: Thanks for your time.  Bye.
  124: No.
  125: I don't like your attitude.  You'd better leave.
  126: All right.  I'm going.
  127: Make me, you damn long-haired freak!
  128: |-
    After sundown nobody is allowed in this area.  The other guards won't even give you a warning.  If they
     catch you they'll attack.  You'd better get back downtown while your head is still attached to your neck.
  129: oK.  I gO.
  130: no.  I stAy.
  131: I'm not going anywhere.
  132: Sorry, I'll be on my way.
  133: Man, you are rock-stupid, aren't you?  Take a hike!

  139: Can you tell me a bit about Gizmo and that casino?
  140: Been boxing for a few years.
  141: |-
    I was always getting into scuffles with my brothers when I grew up.
     One time a small band of raiders attacked Junktown, and I beat one into
     submission before he could get his gun on me. Just luck, really, but Gizmo
     was sponsoring organized fights, and I needed some money. Been boxing
     ever since.
  142: What happened to your brothers?
  143: So what is there to do in this town?
  144: Can you tell me about your boss?
  145: |-
    If you are just looking for supplies, you should try Killian Darkwater's
     store, off southeast of here. You can also get a night's sleep at the Crash
     House near here. If you are planning to stay a while, you might want to get
     a drink over at the Skum Pitt, but watch out for the Skulz.
  146: Who're the Skulz?
  147: So, tell me more about the casino.
  148: |-
    Gizmo's casino is where everybody goes to gamble. There are many games
     and you can have a great time! It's the best place this side of the Hub!
  149: What else is there to do around here?
  150: |-
    My brother James was killed in a raider attack a few years ago. Shortly
     after that, my other brother, Darrell, gathered together some things and set
     off south towards a mythical place called the Glow, in search of the treasure of
     the ancients, or something like that. He never came back.
  151: Why do you stay in Junktown?
  152: Uh, can we change the subject?
  153: I'm sorry to hear of your loss.
  154: What do you know about this legendary place, the Glow?
  155: |-
    Thank you. It's been a few years, but I still don't like to talk about
     it much.
  156: So, can I ask you some questions?
  157: |-
    I live here. I like boxing, I have a good life with Trish, and I have
     no desire to go elsewhere.
  158: Oh. Well, that's good. Mind if we change the subject?
  159: Yes, I've met Trish.
  160: Well, what?
  161: What can I help you with?
  162: What is there to do here?
  163: Can you tell me a little about your boss?
  164: "[You pat your weapon] I'd like you to meet my little friend."
  165: Thanks for chatting. See you around.
  166: |-
    The Skulz are a bad bunch who hang out in the back of the Crash House and
     at the Skum Pitt. Watch out for them; they like playing with knives.
  167: Thanks for the tip. I'll watch my step.
  168: I see. Anything else you can tell me about?
  169: Well, be sure to keep your hands off, eh?
  170: She's very important to me.
  171: |2-
     [Saul frowns.] But she doesn't like my boxing. She doesn't seem to
     understand that it's what I want to do.
  172: |-
    She's concerned for your welfare. She probably can't stand to see you
     getting beaten up and risking your life for Gizmo. If you don't find a
     compromise, you could lose her.
  173: I think she's worried about you.
  174: So, shall we talk about something else?
  175: Well, see you later.
  176: |-
    I never thought of it that way. I figured that she just didn't like
     boxing. I suppose I will have to talk to her more about this. Thanks.
  177: Ah, she just doesn't like boxing, is all.
  178: Well, can we talk about something else?
  179: See you around.
  180: You again. What now?
  181: Hello again.
  182: I'm here to teach you some manners.
  183: I need to talk to you about Trish.
  184: Can you tell me about Junktown?
  185: |-
    From what I've heard, the Glow is a great crater that glows at night. It's
     supposed to be far, far to the south, but I don't know where. Stories say that
     it's inhabited by all sorts of mutant freaks who guard the technology from before
     the War.
  186: I see. Thanks for the info.
  187: Interesting. Can you give me any more info?
  188: That'll be tough with no head, palooka.
GLOWPUMP:
  100: You see a water pump.
  101: |-
    The design of this pump looks very different from the one
     in your Vault.
  102: |-
    You realize that the pump's parts will be incompatible
     with those of your Vault.
ROOMGRD:
  100: You see a Brotherhood Guard.
  101: You shouldn't be in here Initiate.
  102: What are you doing in here?
  103: |-
    The guard room is for guards. You are not a guard. You are in
     the guardroom. Therefore YOU should leave.
  104: Please leave, you shouldn't be here.
  105: Hey, no Initiates.
  106: |-
    This is not the library my boy. If you want to browse go to the
     library.
  107: |-
    This is not the library my girl. If you want to browse go to the
     library.
JAKE:
  100: You see Jake of the Followers.
  101: You see a Follower of the Apocalypse.
  102: Welcome, my friend! How might I help you today?
  103: Me hep! Me hep!
  104: I heard that you are a decent fighter. Let's find out.
  105: I hear you need help. What's the problem?
  106: What can you tell me about the Followers?
  107: |-
    You want to help. I don't think you are good enough to
     help me out. Go talk to Neil.
  108: |-
    I would love to fight you, but I am much too busy helping
     Nicole right now.
  109: Figures. You looked like a wimp to me anyways.
  110: Suit yourself. Good bye.
  111: How did a wimp like you become second in command?
  112: |-
    Hey. Just because I don't want to fight doesn't mean I'm a
     wimp. I just don't feel like it.
  113: I was right. Just a wimp.
  114: |-
    Some of us will use our brains to get further in this world.
     A lot can be settled with peace and thinking.
  115: When are you going to use your brains then?
  116: You're right. I'm sorry.
  117: That's it. I'm not going to talk to you anymore.
  118: |-
    That's better. Now. I have a problem with a spy around here.
     Will you help me?
  119: Yes. What is it?
  120: Fix it yourself if you are so great.
  121: |-
    I just said we have a spy around here. I think it may be one
     of the guards that is the spy. Though it could be a scout.
     Those are the only two groups that have access to the
     Children.
  122: Okay. I'll go get your spy and eliminate the problem.
  123: Have any leads on this spy?
  124: Forget it. I won't help you.
  125: Thank you very much. Now go!
  126: |-
    Nothing really. The only things I really know about is
     that a lot of low level information is getting to the
     Children. This is not good. Heather thinks it is either
     Neil or Peter.
  127: Okay. I will go check on it.
  128: Forget it. I won't help you.
  129: I can't let you leave then.
  130: I will then. Good bye!
  131: |-
    We are having trouble with some of our information
     slipping out to the Children. I think it is a spy.
  132: Okay. So, what is the problem?
  133: Okay, I'll deal with this spy.
  134: Have any leads yet?
  135: Forget it. I won't help you.
  136: Currently, I can't tell you anything. Good day.
  137: I am trying to sleep. Don't bother me.
  138: Hurry up and find that vile scum!
  139: |-
    I knew it was Heather all along. She was deceitful from
     the start. I should have told everyone what I thought at first.
  140: |-
    I never did learn anything from you. Your training
     was useless.
  141: I have a package for you from Gabriel.
  142: Hmm. I see. Thank you.
  143: Get the hell out.
  144: It's the hard way. It's always the hard way.
TAYLOR:
  100: You see a cheery man with close-cropped hair.
  101: You see the town's trader, Tine.
  102: We don't get many strangers around here. What do you want?
  103: Hello, stranger! What can I do for you today?
  104: 'My name''s '
  105: "."
  106: Can I ask you about the Hub merchants?
  107: I'd like to do some trading.
  108: What's your take on Adytum?
  109: Nuthin'.
  110: Yeah, I trade with 'em.
  111: |-
    I do some trading with them from time to time. Mostly I sell
     bullets in exchange for food.
  112: I'm Tine. You have some business to conduct?
  113: Pleasure to meet you. I'm Tine.
  114: Great doin' business with you. Come again.
  115: Whatever.
  116: Keep in touch!
  117: What?
  118: Hello again! What can I help you with?
  119: |-
    It's a good town. Might be a little happier if the Regulators didn't keep such a
     tight grip on things. But hey, that's their style.
  120: |-
    Ain't a bad little town. Zimmerman's a fair man, maybe not the brightest guy.
     And of course we've got Miles, probably the only man in a hundred miles who knows
     anything about science.
GUNRNR:
  100: Hey! Whaddya think you're doing?!
  101: Hey, you got any Nuka Cola?
  102: Business is good.
  103: Gabriel is a great boss.
  104: Nice day, isn't it?
  105: Talk to Zack if you're looking for gear.
  106: Zack sells the weapons.
  107: Keep your weapons holstered.
  108: Don't try any funny business.
  109: We could hold off an army in here.
  110: Some guy fell in the moat once. What a horrible way to go.
  111: Damn that moat, the fumes are making my eyes hurt.
  112: I hate this job.
  113: Get out of my way!
  114: Don't bother me.
  115: Can't you see that I'm busy?
  116: You see a typical Gun Runner.
HOUSCHAR:
  100: You see a worn chair.
  101: You see a worn chair.
  102: The chair seems inviting; however, you must continue on your mission.
CHIDINIT:
  100: You see Initiate Ronald of the Children of the Cathedral.
  101: You see Initiate Caroline of the Children of the Cathedral.
  102: You see Initiate Myles of the Children of the Cathedral.
  103: You see Initiate Alisha of the Children of the Cathedral.
  104: You see Initiate Thomas of the Children of the Cathedral.
  105: You see Initiate Gabriel of the Children of the Cathedral.
  106: You see Initiate Charlene of the Children of the Cathedral.
  107: You see Initiate Ekdar of the Children of the Cathedral.
  108: You see Initiate Hopper of the Children of the Cathedral.
  109: You see Initiate Radek of the Children of the Cathedral.
  110: Those loser Followers were easy to kill.
  111: Now that the Followers are out of the way, the rebuilding can start.
  112: By the end of this search, I hope to be a Scribe or a Scholar.
  113: Someday I shall be a Scholar and go forth preaching Unity.
  114: Orfeo is a difficult person to work with.
  115: I'm still frightened by the Nightkin.
  116: The Elders said that the Nightkin are our allies.
FREEZER:
  100: A heavy military refrigerator.
  101: |-
    A faded paper on the freezer reads:
     Federal Bureau of Investigation,
     Special Projects, Classified: Security Terminus.
UNDRBED:
  100: You see something in the darkness under the bed.
FRY:
  100: You see Deputy Fry.
  101: I’ve been hoping to run into you, child killer. I hope your stay isn’t long.
    I’ll be playing close attention to you while you’re here. Keep your nose clean
    in my city, I’m just dying for an excuse to get rid of scum like you.
  102: Hello friend, Deputy Tony Fry at your service.
  103: What is this place?
  104: Nice to meet you. Bye.
  105: Wug.
  106: Ack!
  107: |-
    Oh, a newcomer! Welcome to the Hub! You've reached the biggest city on
     the coast. Heck, maybe the biggest city in the world for all we know.
     I thought you were part of the caravan, did you come in with them?
  108: Yes.
  109: No.
  110: |-
    I’m not surprised. Most of the new members of our city come in with
     the caravans, even with the missing caravans we’ve had. It’s a fine city
     but be careful who you associate with. People like Decker and his thugs
     can get you into a lot of trouble.
  111: |-
    That’s surprising. It’s been pretty rough out there, especially
     with the missing caravans. But you’re safe now, just stay away from the
     Maltese Falcon. They're a bunch of trouble makers, Decker and his crew.
  112: Who's Decker?
  113: Yeah, well . . . I'm pretty rough.
  114: What was that about missing caravans?
  115: Where can I make some money?
  116: That's it, thanks.
  117: If you say so. So, did you have any other questions?
  118: |-
    It’s a tragedy really. Some caravans have turned up missing.
     Butch over at the Far Go Traders is offering a reward for information or something.
     You should check at the merchant market if you’re interested.
  119: |-
    He owns the Maltese Falcon in the merchant market, but I wouldn’t
     associate with him if you want to stay out of trouble. He’s nothing but a
     murdering animal, but the Sheriff won’t let me arrest him without proof.
  120: |-
    No problem. Believe it or not, our city is quite safe and our police
     are all very highly trained peace keepers. You shouldn’t have any problems,
     just avoid the Maltese Falcon.
  121: |-
    I’m sorry, I don’t understand. Maybe you need healing?
     The Children of the Cathedral are south. Head straight down past the
     Merchant Market down to the Water Merchants. They’re right next to the Water
     Merchants.
  122: I'm still watching you, child killer.
  123: Murdering animal!
  124: I can't believe the Sheriff's dead . . .
  125: |-
    There you are, you thieving little snake! I almost didn’t recognize you.
     Guards!
  126: Sure.
  127: Catch me if you can.
  128: No.
  129: ARG!
  130: |-
    Hello again. I hope you like our town. A nice young man such as yourself,
     is always welcome. If you should decide to stay, I’m sure you would make a
     valuable addition to the Hub.
  131: |-
    Hello again. I hope you like our town. A lovely lady such as yourself,
     is always welcome. If you should decide to stay, I’m sure you would make a
     valuable addition to the Hub.
  132: Hello again. What can I do for you?
  133: Yes? I don't have all day. I'm trying to watch the front gate.
  134: I have a crime to report!
  135: Do you have a hospital, I'm injured.
  136: Where are the shops?
  137: Where's there work around here?
  138: Bye.
  139: Garro?
  140: Ooga.
  141: |-
    Really? I, uh, you should talk to the Sheriff. I can’t leave my post
     right now. I’ve got to . . . uh, fend off any raiders that might come.
     Plus, I’m not very good with reports.
  142: |-
    Oh, sorry. I hadn’t noticed. The Children run the Hospital next
     to the Water Merchants. Go south past the Merchant market and you’ll see it
     just northwest of the Water Merchants. I hope everything goes okay.
  143: |-
    That’s hard to miss. It’s by far the busiest part of town.
     The Merchant Market is a few miles south of here. You’ll be most interested
     in the northern section, that’s where most of our locals buy and sell
     to the public.
  144: |-
    Why that would be in the Merchant Market, a few miles south of here.
     Two of the caravan houses are located there, the third is further south.
     I’d recommend the Far Go Traders. They pay well and they're not too crazy.
  145: Dead… they’re all dead . . .
  146: Pfffftttt . . . Chrrrr . . .
  147: |-
    Do you know where I could find a Water Chip? My vault's chip
     malfunctioned, and we need another immediately.
  148: |-
    Water Chip? Well, I've never heard of one. If it has to do with water,
     though, you should talk to the Water Merchants. Their headquarters are
     located further south, past the Downtown area.
MSTMERCH:
  100: You see a Master Merchant
  101: Arrest this thief!
  102: "...I don't care what they say.  We need new parts... Oh, yes.  Sorry. What
    can I do for you?"
  103: I want a job.
  104: Do you have a water chip?
  105: Nothing, bye.
  106: Shek.
  107: Sure, great.  You're hired.  Wait.  What position?  Oh, caravan guard right?  Yeah,
    sure. You can work for us.  You look okay.  Anything else?
  108: Nope.
  109: Yes, do you have a water chip?
  110: Veh?
  111: Sorry, no time for nonsense!
  112: |-
    Water chip... hmm.  Oh, those old Vault purifying control chips.  Well, I'm sure I speak for the entire town when I say
     you won't find one here.  Without the proper equipment they're worthless.  Only a Vault, or maybe Necropolis would have any
     use for one.  Why do you ask?
  113: Necropolis?  Why would they need one?
  114: My vault's chip broke and I'm looking for a replacement.
  115: Just curious.
  116: I can't say.
  117: |-
    Really? Well as you probably have heard, we supply a great deal of water throughout the area.  I am sure we could
     arrange to send a caravan up to your Vault for a fee.
  118: How much are we talking about?
  119: I don't know if I can trust you.
  120: No thanks.
  121: Yeah, if you say so.
  122: Then I'm sorry, I don't think I can help.
  123: |-
    Can't trust me?!?  I'm routinely trusted to deliver water to people far more paranoid than yourself!  What do you
     think we are?  Terrorists?
  124: Okay fine.  How much money do you want to start the Caravans.
  125: I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to imply anything, but I can't take the risk.
  126: Well, if you change your mind let me know. I'm very curious now.
  127: Hello again.
  128: I need a water chip.
  129: I'm still looking for a water chip.
  130: I want a job.
  131: Bye.
  132: Sure, great.  You're hired.  Wait.  What position?  Oh, caravan guard right?  Yeah,
    sure.  You can work for us.  You look okay.
  133: We already went through this.  Are you willing to pay the price to have the
    water caravans start?
  134: Earlier you mentioned that Necropolis might have a water chip.  Why would they
    need one?
  135: How much are we talking about?
  136: No, not yet.
  137: |-
    Well, it's just a guess really.  We tried to start a caravan route to Necropolis once, but they refused to trade with us.
      Nobody in their right mind refuses water these days unless they have a reliable supply.  I figure they must have their own
     purifier or they would have died out a long time ago.  So are you looking to have us go up to your Vault?
  138: Yes, how much is it going to cost me?
  139: No thanks.
  140: |-
    Well, it is quite a distance away.  2000 caps should cover the initial caravan, and I'm sure your Vault will
     have stuff to trade to keep us going for a while.  However with our current reserves, I'm guessing that we will only be
     able to keep your Vault going for an extra 100 days or so.
  141: Alright, here is the money.
  142: The Vault should be able to take care of most of your initial payment.  Why
    don't I give you 1000 instead to start.
  143: It is quite a ways, but the Vault has plenty of goods to reimburse you for
    your upfront money.  So, how about 500 instead?
  144: I don't have the cash, I'll come back when I do.
  145: 'It looks like you don''t have enough money, come back when you do.  Remember
    you need '
  146: " caps."
  147: |-
    Ok, I can start sending the caravans up to your Vault today.  Now you ought to know, the caravans are pretty visible going
     across the desert.   So, sending the caravans out that way is going to paint a pretty good picture for anyone that might be
     looking for your Vault.   Are you still sure you want them sent out that way?
  148: I guess not.
  149: Yes, the Vault needs water.
  150: That sounds fair enough.  The technology from the Vaults can fetch a pretty
    good price down here in the Hub.
  151: Sorry but I can only accept full payment.
  152: That sounds fair enough.  The technology from the Vaults can fetch a pretty
    good price down here in the Hub.
  153: Sorry but I can only accept full payment.
  154: Are you going to pay the amount I asked for to get the water caravans rolling?
  155: Ok, they'll start off in a few hours.
  156: I'm sorry, but the Water Merchants will not associate with you any longer.
  157: 'Do you have the '
  158: " caps for us to start the water caravan to your vault?"
HUBCAPTR:
  100: You see a seedy looking person.
  101: What do you want?
  102: Get out of here!
  103: You want a bullet through that thick skull of yours?
  104: That's it!
  105: Eat this!
  106: Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
  107: Step right up, stranger!
  108: Ride my bullet, son…
  109: Ride my bullet, bitch…
GLOBLELV:
  100: You see an elevator door with blue markings on it.
  101: |-
    You are shocked by the security system, but sustain no damage.
     Perhaps you should try using something to bypass the security system.
  102: |-
    You are shocked by the security system, and sustain a point of damage.
     Perhaps you should try using something to bypass the security system.
  103: 'You are shocked by the security system, and sustain '
  104: |2-
     points of damage. Perhaps you should try using something
     to bypass the security system.
  105: You disarm the security system on the door.
  106: That item has no effect on the door.
MORPCOMP:
  100: Before you is a Mach IV Computer.
  101: It seems as though the system is in a reboot status.
  102: The system seems to have locked up.
  103: The monitor flickers.
  104: The screen is showing odd color patterns.
  105: |-
    The computer screen is displaying small green bombs falling
     endlessly towards the ground.
  106: You cannot hack the screen password.
  107: |-
    You access some electronic notes. The most interesting is
     a request from the Lieutenant for "...more human subjects to dip.
     Send them immediately to the Military Base."
OFFICER:
  100: You! Stop right there and face the law!
  101: |-
    Thank you for returning the water-chip. It's really
     going to help morale, and keep people from breaking vault law.
  102: Good to see you again. Is there anything that I can do for you?
  103: What do you do?
  104: Yeah, I need some weapons.
  105: Why would there be a locked door in the Vault?
  106: Glop!
  107: Hmmm. I think you should be somewhere else besides here. Have a nice day.
  108: |-
    I'm in charge of Vault security and law enforcement.
     You might not know it, but the Vault wouldn't run as well if it wasn't for me.
  109: Hmm. Neat. Thanks.
  110: Sounds important.
  111: |-
    It is. Without proper adherence to the laws, the Vault
     would soon be a lawless place, with no direction. That would jeopardize
     the safety of us all.
  112: |-
    Now that I've been outside, are there any laws that
     apply specifically to me?
  113: |-
    I've seen some places on the outside world that suffer
     because they have no laws.
  114: |-
    Well, even if weapons are required on the outside world,
     don't display them in a threatening manner in here.
     Other than that, I can't think of anything in particular.
  115: Thanks.
  116: |-
    You see, I knew that would happen. People obeying law
     is the only thing that has saved the Vault from misery
     and destruction. Keep up the good work.
  117: "The Overseer has not authorized me to open the armory and\n get you more weapons.
    I'm sorry, but I can't help you. "
  118: Please! I really need them!
  119: Ok. Thanks, anyways.
  120: No. I can't do it.
  121: Have a nice day.
  122: |-
    To keep the weapons away from those who don't have
     access to them.
  123: Who has access?
  124: That doesn't seem very fair.
  125: |-
    Life isn't fair, sometimes. But our law is. Have
     a nice day.
  126: The Overseer, myself and my security team. That's it.
  127: It sounds like only people with need have access.
  128: That's really a small list.
  129: Yes, it is. I have to get back to work.
  130: Yes, only people with need can get in.
  131: Well, I have need. Please open the door.
  132: I'm sorry, it's a good argument, but I can't let you in.
  133: |-
    Hmm. Now that you mention it, it sounds like you do. Here,
     let me get the door for you.
  134: 'What can I do for you, '
  135: "?"
  136: I need more weapons.
  137: You feeling ok?
  138: Huh-huh.
  139: |-
    Great. Your intelligence staggers me. I can't possibly
     think anymore.
  140: Sorry, you've gotten all we can spare. Good day.
  141: I don't like your kind. Rabble-rousers. You should be ashamed.
  142: Yeah, well, same to you, muttonhead.
  143: Don't you think you're being a little harsh?
  144: |-
    Watch your language, or I'll bring you in for failure
     to respect a law enforcement officer.
  145: Yeah, right. See you around.
  146: That's it. I'm fed up with you rousting me.
  147: |-
    Hmm. Possibly. It should be my job to be impartial,
     but I might have stepped over the line this time.
     I'll try and do better in the future.
  148: Hmm. No. Probably not harsh enough.
  149: Good luck. I hope you can do the job.
  150: You'd better not let me down.
  151: Put your weapon away, right now.
  152: What do you think you are doing with that in here?
  153: Just practicing my aim.
  154: Nothing, sorry. Didn't mean to have it drawn.
  155: Hung.
  156: |-
    Be careful what you call me. And don't draw a weapon
     inside. This is the Vault for god's sake.
  157: |-
    You'd better not be practicing it in here. Me and you
     will have a serious problem if you do it again.
  158: I knew that outside life would get you into trouble.

  104: Ok.

  106: You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.
  107: Sorry to bother you.
  108: Nice doing business with you.
  109: "[]"
  110: Ok. Come back if you need anything.
  111: |-
    You'd better make up your mind fast. Are you here to
     buy equipment, or did you just come here to get shot?
  112: You have a real attitude problem.
  113: Sorry, maybe I could use some equipment after all.
  114: What the hell are you doing here then?
  115: Nothing.
  116: Sure.
  117: |-
    Yeah, well until Gabriel says so, you've gotta pay
     full price like everybody else.
  118: I don't know about that.
  119: Show me what you have anyway.
  120: Great! Show me what you got.

    You struggle with the computer for a while, but you cannot
     remove the chip. After a moment, you realize you forgot to remove
     the locking bolts.
  106: |-
    You did not remove the chip. Perhaps you should try again,
     this time a little more carefully.

  108: You fail to repair the computer.
  109: You learn nothing special about the water computer.

    You reinstall the water chip into the computer. The computer
     reboots after a moment, and proceeds to function as normal.

  113: 'You gain '

    You examine the computer carefully. Your analytical mind discovers
     a couple of methods that will ease the removal of the water chip.
  116: |-
    You learn that there is no way to fix the computer without
     reinstalling the water chip.
  117: |-
    After shutting down the Water Purification Computer, you can now
     hear the repaired water pump working in the distance, bringing water up
     from what must be a deep well under Necropolis.

    The Followers are a learned and peaceful people. They live in an old
     library north of here.

     there is something strange about their religion. The Cathedral is
     south of here.

    The Rippers are all inbred. They have a fortified building with traps
     around it where they take prisoners to be tortured and killed.
  18304: |-
    The Blades are notorious for their vibro-knives. They are the
     arch-enemies of the Rippers. Their leader is a woman named Razor.

    We are the Followers of the Apocalypse. It is our duty to bring peace
     and learning once again to the world, and to make sure that the

  18902: |-
    The Cathedral is a great building south of the Boneyard. The Children

     radioactive sludge. They sell guns to the other gangs.

     caravans to many places, including Adytum.

     stop for the weary traveler.
  18908: Although I've read about Vault technology, it's a little beyond me.

    Nicole is our leader. She's compelled by insight and spirituality to

  27703: Our arch-enemies to the west will be crushed soon!
  27704: We are the Blades! Never forget it!

  27707: I've heard of that place, but not anything about it.
  27708: A what?

  27901: |-
    Hmph. Don't get me started. They don't have the stomach or courage to
     fight.
  27902: |-
    They're cultists in a big church to the south. They seem harmless but
     something weird is going on there.
  27903: The Rippers are like mangy dogs - vicious, inbred, and stupid.
  27904: |-
    See my blade? We make these ourselves. Every one of use makes his
     own. Hence our name.
  27905: |-
    They came down from the Hub looking for turf, but they decided to
     become salesmen instead of warriors.
  27906: |-
    That's a trading city to the east. Merchants from there come here
     sometimes to trade with Adytum and the Gun Runners.
  27907: I think it's north-east of here. It's a small city.
  27908: A what?

    Razor is our leader and champion. I have no doubt that her experience
     will grant us victory at last over those Rippers.

    Far east of here. Supposedly, ghouls that eat human flesh live there.
     I wouldn't want to fight the ghouls.

  28704: Sneaky gang to the east.
  28705: Yeah? What?

    A group of peace-lovers hiding out south of here. We should just get
     rid of them.
  28902: |-
    Oh yeah, those crazy old monks. They're nuts. Their big church is
     south of the Boneyard.
  28903: Hey, they may be stupid, but they sure buy a lot of guns!
  28904: |-
    They always use those weird vibro-knives that they make. I'd like to
     get my hands on one. But at least they buy some guns, too.
  28905: You're talking to us.
  28906: |-
    It's a big trading center back east. We trade with Hub merchants to
     buy and sell weapons and armor.

  29100: |-
    They are a small town to the south. They don't deal with us. I
     couldn't care less about them.
  29101: |-
    They try to convert everyone to their ways of peace while they hide
     in their library to the south. They don't help business any!
  29102: |-
    The Cathedral's this big church south of the Boneyard, where some
     strange cult worships a Dark God. I think they're freaky.
  29103: |-
    The Rippers are all one big family, literally. They're impossible to
     deal with if they don't know you, so don't even try. They are in a big
     booby-trapped fortress southwest of us. Watch out for land mines if
     you're stupid enough to visit.
  29104: |-
    They've converted several small buildings to the southeast into their
     home. They are pretty well organized and smarter than the Rippers.
     They sometimes let outsiders join, too. Their leader, Razor, is one
     tough woman.
  29105: That's us. Good money in selling guns to the Blades and the Rippers here.
  29106: |-
    That's the trading city east of here where we get our guns and do
     trading. They send out caravans all over the place. You could probably
     travel with a caravan when one shows up in Adytum.
  29107: |-
    It's a small frontier town just north of the Hub. There's a great
     casino there, but the town's sheriff is just a little too
     overbearing.
  29108: I have no idea what that is.
  29109: |-
    This is the north side of the Boneyard. It's funny, people from
     outside use it as a curse - if something's bad, they say it 'Bites the
     Bone'. But it's not too bad once you get used to it.
GENPALAD:

  101: Sorry, can't talk, Initiate.

    Did you know you could survive for weeks without water in a suit
     of powered armor?
  104: Don't you just love a good fight?
  105: |-
    I really like the new laser rifles, but the old laser pistols
     are my favorite.
  106: |-
    The night perimeter patrols are very dangerous. I wouldn't wander
     too far at night if I were you.
  107: Be careful, it's a deadly world out there.
  108: I think my armor has a spot on it!
  109: |-
    The Brotherhood is great. I haven't had any experience
     outside of it, but it couldn't possibly get better than this.
  110: Good day, Initiate.
  111: If you need anything, you should talk to Vree.
  112: Vree's right over there if you need to talk to someone.
  113: |-
    I've got to find time between the patrols and training to keep up
     with my studies. I think I'm getting a little rusty.
  114: |-
    You've got to keep your mind and body in top condition at all times,
     Initiate.
  115: Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my son.
  116: Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my lady.
PERNPWR:

  104: Who do I get to kill next.
  105: What are we doing chatting?
  106: I don't like these brown robed shitheads, thank you very much.
  107: This could be dangerous.
  108: Time to leave.
  109: This place looks like shit on a wall.
  110: I think I'm going to be sick.
  111: Nicole told us to return as soon as you left the Cathedral.
  112: Glad to meet ya. Let's get it on.
GIZMO:
  100: You see Gizmo, the casino owner.
  101: |-
    Get your butt in here and sit down.
     We got some business to discuss.
  102: Looks like there's enough butt in here already . . .
  103: I gathered as much.  What do you want?
  104: What business?
  105: Blehh.
  106: Get outta here, ya' idiot!
  107: You kiss your mother with that mouth? Show some respect.
  108: You do anything but eat?
  109: You're right, I'm sorry.  So let's talk business.
  110: |-
    All right, [Gizmo snorts] here's the deal. Junktown, it
     ain't what it used to be. The only reason
     it's still here is because of my gambling establishment.  Even so,
     Killian's been breathing down my neck, and I'm starting to take it
     personal. [Gizmo snorts] And that's where you come in, slick.
  111: What do you want me to do?
  112: If you think I'd help you, you're fat and stupid.
  113: Funny.
  114: |-
    What I think is you're going to take him out for me, you know? No
     witnesses, just in, over, out.
  115: Why don't you send one of your own goons in?
  116: |-
    I wouldn't work for you if you offered me all
     the money in this crummy place.
  117: Sure. I can use the money.
  118: I don't think so. Thanks anyway.
  119: How much you willing to pay?
  120: |-
    I would, but there must be no connection between me and Killian's
     unfortunate demise.
  121: Makes sense. Sure, I'll do it.
  122: All right, I'll do it.
  123: What a coward. Afraid people won't like you? Too late.
  124: How much you willing to pay?
  125: No way in Hell.
  126: I don't think so. Thanks anyway.
  127: |-
    [Gizmo wheezes.] I knew you'd see it my way. As proof, I want the dog tags Killian
     wears around his neck. Ya' get them, ya' get your money. Now, just get.
     And don't cross me. I still got the kneecaps from the last one
     who tried.
  128: Thousand caps. No more, no less.
  129: Sounds good. I'll do it.
  130: |-
    You call that a reward? If I'm to whack the guy, I'm going to need
     more than that.
  131: Not even close. I don't want any part of this deal.
  132: |-
    I wouldn't trust you as far as two people could throw you.
     Forget it, slim.
  133: |-
    [Gizmo laughs and coughs] Maybe you're right.
     I think you're worth more. 1500.
  134: Now we're talking.
  135: That's about what, a dollar a pound for you? Forget it.
  136: Thank you, but I'd rather not.
  137: No way in Hell.
  138: |-
    Sorry you feel that way. Not as sorry as you're gonna be,
     though. Can't let word of this get out. Izo, show our
     new friend what we do with people who say no to me.
  139: |-
    One is okay. Two is too much. And that was two.
     Izo, get me a set of kneecaps.
  140: Did ya' finish the job yet?
  141: Yep, sure did.
  142: Nope, not yet.
  143: Let's see the tags.
  144: |-
    Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Izo's got your money. Oh, this is good!
     Hey, hey, uh . . . you should leave town for a while.
     You know, just in case.
  145: Okay, I'm going.
  146: You don't order me around, fat boy. You got that?
  147: And if I don't?
  148: Sure, I'll go. Just remember you owe me one.
  149: You don't leave town, you end up under it. You got me?
  150: Okay, okay. I'm going.
  151: |-
    Who's going to do that? You? You couldn't get off your fat butt to
     get a sandwich, much less kill me.
  152: All right, fine. Just remember you owe me.
  153: Then give me the dog tags?
  154: Um . . . well . . . I . . . uh, lost them.
  155: What if I don't want to give them you?
  156: I lied. I don't have them.
  157: I had them, but then I lost them.
  158: |-
    [Gizmo laughs.] You know, you're a crummy liar.  Now go get the tags. I don't
     want to see your face until you've offed Killian.
  159: No problem, I take them off your dead body.
  160: Uh . . . well, I kinda lied. I don't have them.
  161: Yeah? You going to hire somebody to do your bending for you?
  162: I lost them.
  163: Well, I had them, but they were stolen.
  164: |-
    No tags, no money. You come back without the tags again and
     Izo gets creative with your anatomy. Now get out!
  165: What do you want? I'm a busy man.
  166: I'm here to tell you your assassin failed.
  167: Nothing, actually. I'll just be going now.
  168: I want to know how someone as stupid as you is still alive.
  169: I'm here to talk about the attempt on Killian's life.
  170: I don't know what you're talking about.
  171: |-
    Of course you do. You hired someone to kill Killian,
     and he screwed up.
  172: You don't remember hiring someone to kill Killian, you stupid slug?
  173: Well, let's take a hypothetical situation . . .
  174: You're a liar!
  175: You're right. Goodbye.
  176: |-
    I don't know who you are, but I don't take kindly to strangers
     walking into my office and accusing me of things they know nothing about.
  177: |-
    Ah, but there's where you miss the point, Gizmo.
     I'm not accusing. I'm here to help you.
  178: I know it all. So confess!
  179: You're right. I'm leaving.
  180: |-
    Really? [Gizmo chuckles.] He's gonna help me?
     What kinda help are we talking about?
  181: |-
    Easy. You sent someone to kill Killian.
     He failed. You need someone who can do the job . . . better.
  182: Nothing. Forget I brought it up.
  183: And let me guess. You're that someone?
  184: Very good . . . For a price, of course.
  185: I can kill him quicker than you can spit.
  186: Well, how can I trust you?
  187: |-
    I'm here. And you need someone from out of
     town to do your dirty work. Right?
  188: You can't . . . I mean you can . . . I mean . . .
  189: Because I've been around. I've killed before.
  190: |-
    Hmm . . . all right. We can do this. But you work for me, you better know
     that nobody ever double-crosses Gizmo and lives to talk about it. You got me?
  191: |-
    Oh, I could put one over on you . . . just no way
     anyone could put one 'round you.
  192: Of course. But first I need to know why you want him dead.
  193: |-
    Huh. That's easy. I want him dead because he cramps my business. So,
     will you do him for me?
  194: That's why I'm here. He'll be dead before sundown.
  195: Sure. It's a job.
  196: Could you say that again please . . . this time in my coat pocket?
  197: Well, um . . . No, I can't.
  198: |-
    Good. Return with the dog tags he wears around his neck as proof.
     And we never had this conversation, you
     don't mention this to anyone. No one double crosses me. No one.
  199: |-
    You're either real stupid . . . or a real stupid spy. Doesn't matter,
     because now Izo's gonna make you real dead.
  200: I don't like people who waste my time. Don't come back again soon!
  201: Such as?
  202: |-
    Well, let's say you did try and kill Killian, and your
     assassin failed. That means you need a new one to do the job right.
  203: Huh? Oh, never mind.
  204: |-
    You know, [Gizmo sighs] I don't like it when people insult me
     in my own place. Izo, escort our guest out . . . through the window.
  205: |-
    You're back. You know, I had to hire someone else to do your work.
     That didn't make me happy. In fact, Izo will show you just how unhappy I am. I hope
     you had a nice day. It was your last.
  206: |-
    [Gizmo grunts.] Killian's the mayor of this town.
     Thinks he knows everything . . . well, we'll just see how much he knows, won't we?
  207: "[Gizmo coughs.] That's me, stupid. I run the . . . gambling establishment
    here."
  208: That's Killian's place the north end of town. He sells crap.
  209: Well, most people gamble here. You ask stupid questions.
  210: Wouldn't you like to know?
  211: You don't need to concern yourself with that.
  212: "[Gizmo sniffs.] I uh . . . I don't feel like talking about that right now."
  213: Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? Izo, tear his arms off!
  214: Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? Izo, tear off her arms!
  215: What, are you deaf? I said . . .
  216: Hey, I won't repeat myself again!
  217: |-
    You gain 600 experience points for your work in the defeat of Gizmo.
     May the bastard rest in pieces.
  218: This is easily the most corpulent individual you have ever seen.
  219: |-
    You know, I found something very interesting after you was last here.
     If there's one thing I can't stand more than a lousy pepperoni pizza,
     it's a snitch. Boys!
  220: |-
    So it comes down to this, Killian. Well, I never could put up with your
     stink, and now I'm gonna put an end to it!
  221: I took care of Killian. Word is you might appreciate that.
  222: Oh, really?
  223: Hey, okay, if you don't want him dead, fine. Just tryin' to be helpful.
  224: I was thinking maybe knife in the back or bullet in the head.
  225: Got it. What'cha want 'im dead for?
  226: |-
    Really? [Gizmo chuckles.] She's gonna help me?
     What kinda help are we talking about?
  980: Wouldn't you like to know?
