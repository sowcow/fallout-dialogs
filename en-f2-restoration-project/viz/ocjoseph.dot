The mutation\nfactor is quite high.\nThis species is highly\nintelligent, about the\nequivalent of an\neight-year-old,\nwith some individuals\nreaching human normal\nlevel. Their learning\ncapacity is very high and\nthey are\ncapable of abstract\nthought and reasoning.\n---\nAlthough they do not have\nvocal chords, the\ndeathclaws seem to mimic\nhuman speech much the\nsame\nas a parrot does. I have\nyet to discover the exact\nmechanism behind this, so\nI am unable to say more\nat\nthis time. Socially,\nthey are pack animals\nwith a very rigid code of\nethics. They are led by\nan 'alpha\nmale' who rules with the\nmutual consent of the\npack. They appear to be\nextremely loyal to the\npack as a\nwhole, treating it as a\nfamily unit rather than\nhaving individual\nfamilies as humans do.\n---\nTheir sense of right and\nwrong is very well\ndefined. They do follow a\ncode of ethics that is\nenforced by the pack as\na whole. Violence is\nnever used as a solution\nto a problem among the\npack as\nfar as I can see.
